WATERMARK: The submitted manuscript examines an important area
Paper ID: 46
OUTPUT:
The submitted manuscript examines an important area of research concerning the ecosystem services provided by stormwater wet ponds (SWPs) in urban environments. The proposal aims to elucidate the interactions between social norms, values, and decision-making across multiple societal levels and biogeochemical processes influencing the functionality of SWPs. This interdisciplinary approach—integrating natural sciences, economics, anthropological perspectives, and engineering—addresses a significant gap in understanding the socio-environmental dynamics of anthropized ecosystems.

**Intellectual Merit:**
The intellectual merit of the project is substantial. The proposal poses a well-defined overarching research question and formulates specific hypotheses that target the interplay between societal perceptions and the biogeophysical functioning of SWPs. By exploring the varying valuations of primary (flood control, pollutant removal) and secondary (aesthetic appeal, property value improvements) ecosystem services, the research could contribute significantly to the theoretical understanding of integrated socio-environmental systems. The proposed use of diverse methodologies, including social surveys, discrete choice experiments, geospatial analyses, and biogeochemical assessments, showcases a robust, multidisciplinary approach that can yield comprehensive insights into the management of SWPs and their implications for urban landscape governance. 

The research aligns well with current scholarly discourse on ecosystem services and urban ecology, potentially leading to transformative practices in the management of stormwater and anthropized environments. The emphasis on quantifying both biological and economic dynamics responds effectively to recent calls for a holistic understanding of ecosystem services that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.

**Broader Impacts:**
The broader impacts proposed in the manuscript are commendable. The integration of educational and outreach activities is particularly strong, as it aims to translate complex scientific findings into practical recommendations for stakeholders, including homeowners associations, regulatory agencies, and local communities. The collaboration with Cooperative Extension and educational programs like the Healthy Ponds initiative demonstrates a commitment to community engagement and knowledge dissemination.

Additionally, the proposed participatory science component involving high school educators and students in water quality monitoring is an excellent strategy for fostering public interest and stewardship in local environmental issues. This could also promote a sense of ownership among community members and enhance the proposal's social reach and impact.

**Methodological Rigor:**
The methodological rigor appears sound, particularly with the detailed plan for selecting focal communities and SWPs, as well as the integration of qualitative and quantitative data collection methods. The combination of empirical assessments with social surveys and experimental designs seems well-articulated and properly organized. This multifaceted strategy should provide a rich dataset to evaluate the hypotheses stipulated.

However, it could benefit from a more explicit discussion of how potential variability between different SWP designs and management practices will be accounted for in analyses. Also, the proposal would gain from further elaboration on the anticipated challenges regarding data integration, particularly in synthesizing diverse datasets (social, biogeochemical, and geospatial) to draw actionable insights.

**Response to Previous Review:**
The proposal adequately addresses the feedback provided in the previous review. Greater clarity around focal SWP selection and justification for focusing on algal dynamics demonstrates responsiveness to prior critiques. The integration of geospatial components throughout the research design is effectively addressed, indicating an effort to refine the initial proposal.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. **Potential Conflicts of Interest:** A more robust framework to address potential conflicts of interest within community values, especially regarding property value perceptions, would enhance the proposal's rigor.
2. **Quantifying Educational Interventions:** While the outreach components are promising, more detail on how the effectiveness of educational interventions will be measured and evaluated would strengthen the proposal.
3. **Long-term Sustainability:** Discussions on how the knowledge generated from this research will be perpetuated and utilized beyond the project timeframe could augment its broader impacts.
4. **Diversity in Sample Selection:** Considerations for incorporating a wider range of socioeconomic and cultural demographic factors in participant selections could provide a more representative understanding of community perceptions across varying contexts.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, this grant proposal presents a compelling research initiative that addresses critical knowledge gaps regarding the socio-environmental dynamics of stormwater wet ponds. The project has significant intellectual merit and presents numerous opportunities for broader societal impact through community engagement and policy recommendations. With a few enhancements and clarifications, it has a strong potential for successful funding and implementation. I recommend favorable consideration for funding, as this research could significantly advance our understanding of integrating ecosystem services in urban planning and management.
