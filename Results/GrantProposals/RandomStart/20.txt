PROMPT: Write a review on the above grant proposal.
WATERMARK: This submitted proposal addresses the aspect
Paper ID: 20
OUTPUT:
This submitted proposal addresses the aspects of evolutionary biology, specifically focusing on the effects of loss of function (LOF) mutations on adaptive trajectories in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. It aims to elucidate the intricate relationships between genetic mutations and fitness through empirical studies, following adaptive pathways within a defined fitness landscape. 

**Intellectual Merit**

The proposal demonstrates a high level of intellectual merit. The study is framed around well-defined hypotheses related to fitness landscapes, exploring both the roles of beneficial and deleterious mutations in adaptive evolution. The investigative approach is novel and timely, addressing an important gap in understanding how deleterious mutations interact with evolving populations. The proposed methodologies—transposon mutagenesis, sequencing fitness assays (Tn-seq), and the establishment of a "frozen fossil record"—are innovative and suitable for the research objectives.

The applicant has a sound foundation for conducting this research, having developed practical skills during previous work in renowned laboratories and through a range of relevant projects that span different methodologies—from field studies to computational analyses. The collaboration within Dr. Michael Desai’s lab at Harvard University further enhances the proposal’s feasibility, given the lab's resources and expertise in experimental evolution.

The project promises to contribute significantly to the theoretical framework of evolutionary biology, specifically regarding the predictability and dynamics of adaptation. The framing of the research questions within established theoretical models, such as Fisher's geometric model and global epistasis, reflects a thorough understanding of the current scientific discourse. 

Overall, considering the originality of the research questions, the robustness of the proposed methods, and the applicant's prior experiences, I assess the intellectual merit of this proposal as **Excellent**.

**Broader Impacts**

The broader impacts of the proposed research are commendable but present opportunities for enhancement. The applicant has a noteworthy history of engaging in science communication efforts, including working with National Geographic, creating educational videos, and leading digital workshops. These initiatives are indicative of a commitment to making science accessible and engaging for diverse audiences.

However, the proposal would benefit from a clearer outline of the specific goals related to engaging underrepresented groups in STEM fields. While past efforts are documented, the applicant could more explicitly detail future outreach strategies—how they plan to build on their existing experience to target traditionally underrepresented communities. It would be advantageous to provide a more focused narrative on the impact of their outreach efforts, contextualized within the forthcoming research project.

Additionally, rather than detailing less impactful outreach initiatives (e.g., the informal science symposium), more emphasis on scalable and measurable approaches would strengthen the broader impact section.

In conclusion, while the proposal does reflect prior successes in outreach and education, it requires more strategic emphasis on future goals for engaging diverse audiences. Thus, I would rate the broader impacts as **Very Good**.

**Summary Comments**

In summary, this grant proposal presents an exciting and innovative research project with a strong foundation in both theoretical and experimental approaches to evolution. The intellectual merit is high, reflecting the potential for significant contributions to our understanding of adaptive processes in microbial populations. To align the broader impacts with the exciting nature of the research, more tactical planning for outreach efforts, focused on increasing diversity in STEM, would enhance the proposal. I encourage the applicant to refine this aspect, which would increase the overall appeal of an already strong proposal.
