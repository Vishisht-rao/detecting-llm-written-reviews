WATERMARK: This manuscript explores an important aspect
Paper ID: 25
OUTPUT:
This manuscript explores an important aspect of biodiversity and animal behavior—the impact of anthropogenic change on social groups within species, specifically focusing on zebrafish. The proposal is well-structured, outlining clear objectives and methodologies while addressing both the intellectual merit and broader impacts of the research.

**Strengths:**

1. **Relevance of Research Topic**: The proposal addresses a crucial issue in contemporary biological research: understanding how human-induced rapid environmental change impacts social structures in animal groups. This has significant implications for conservation biology and the management of biodiversity.

2. **Clear Research Objectives**: The three aims—understanding the principles that guide group organization, the association of individual phenotypes with network positions, and the resilience of social ties to anthropogenic change—are well-defined and directly address the overarching research question.

3. **Innovative Methodological Approach**: The integration of empirical and modeling techniques, especially the use of agent-based models (ABMs) alongside behavioral assays, represents a noteworthy strength of the proposal. This combination will enable the researcher to understand complex social interactions in a systematic manner.

4. **Strong Mentorship and Institutional Support**: The involvement of well-regarded researchers in the fields of sensory ecology, behavioral science, and computational modeling (Drs. Higgs and Krause) is a significant advantage. Their track record and commitment to mentorship enhance the research environment.

5. **Broader Impact Initiatives**: The inclusion of outreach efforts, especially focusing on underrepresented groups in STEM, demonstrates a commitment to equity and inclusion. This is commendable and should positively impact the next generation of scientists.

6. **Open Science Practices**: The proposal commits to open-access dissemination of research outputs, which will facilitate wider engagement and reproducibility in scientific research.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Detailing Data Management Plans**: While the proposal addresses data sharing and reuse, further elaboration on specific strategies for managing and integrating diverse data types (e.g., behavioral assays, videos, network models) could enhance the robustness of the data management plan.

2. **Clarifying Expected Outcomes**: The research objectives focus on predicting resilience to anthropogenic disturbances, but it would strengthen the proposal to clarify what specific outcomes or applications are anticipated from the research findings. For example, how might the results inform conservation strategies or policy?

3. **Potential Challenges**: Discussing possible challenges and contingencies in the research design could strengthen the proposal. For example, what specific anthropogenic factors may pose difficulties in the experimental setup or in data collection, and how will these be mitigated?

4. **Mentoring Plan Specificity**: While a mentoring plan is mentioned, detailing specific skills or areas of development that the applicant aims to achieve through mentoring could add depth. This may include particular workshops, seminars, or skill development activities that will be undertaken to advance their professional trajectory.

5. **Evaluation Metrics for Broader Impacts**: The proposal outlines several broader impacts, but it would benefit from a more structured approach to evaluating these impacts. Specific metrics or assessment tools should be clearly defined to measure the success of outreach and education efforts.

**Overall Assessment:**

This proposal presents a comprehensive and methodically sound approach to examining how social groups in zebrafish respond to human-induced environmental changes. It aligns well with funding agency priorities, demonstrating significant intellectual merit and a strong commitment to societal impacts through education and outreach. With some refinements in data management, outcome specifications, and mentoring details, this proposal has the potential to contribute valuably to the field of behavioral ecology and conservation biology.
