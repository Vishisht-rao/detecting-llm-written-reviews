WATERMARK: This submitted manuscript explores an important topic
Paper ID: 49
OUTPUT:
This submitted manuscript explores an important topic: the role of prior expectations in biased learning processes and how this is reflected in behavioral outcomes and neural activity. The proposal outlines a compelling research agenda that employs a multifaceted approach combining behavioral experiments, computational models, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to address several nuanced hypotheses regarding expectations and learning dynamics.

### Strengths:

1. **Clear Research Objectives**: The proposal effectively delineates its objectives, specifically investigating how prior expectations bias new learning, and differentiates between confirmatory and surprise biases. The presence of a structured framework allows for the articulation of hypotheses that are both relevant and measurable.

2. **Innovative Use of Reinforcement Learning Models**: The integration of reinforcement learning (RL) models into the investigation of how expectations influence learning is a significant and innovative aspect of this research. The use of reward prediction errors (RPEs) as a measure of learning dynamics provides a robust framework for quantitatively assessing biases in learning.

3. **Multimodal Methodology**: The proposalâ€™s incorporation of behavioral experiments, computational modeling, and fMRI allows for a comprehensive analysis of the problem. This multi-pronged approach enhances the likelihood of producing meaningful insights and strengthens the overall validity of the research.

4. **Addressing a Critical Gap in Understanding**: By controlling for prior expectations in learning scenarios, the research directly addresses inconsistencies in existing RL literature regarding asymmetric learning rates. This focus promises to advance our understanding of learning processes in cognitive and social contexts and offers potential applications in clinical settings.

5. **Broad Impact Potential**: The relevance to psychiatric conditions such as anxiety and depression highlights the potential broader implications of the research. The proposal emphasizes how findings could contribute to improving cognitive-behavioral therapy frameworks by integrating insights about expectations and learning processes.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Sample Size Justification**: While the proposal suggests recruiting 500 participants for Experiment 1, it could benefit from a more detailed statistical justification for this sample size concerning the intended analyses. While the need for robust data on individual differences is acknowledged, clarifying the calculations used to determine this number and how it aligns with the expected effect sizes would strengthen the proposal.

2. **Control Measures**: Although the proposal mentions manipulating prior expectations, it could further elaborate on how to effectively control for potential confounding variables that may influence learning biases. Specifically, discussing how individual differences (cognitive styles, personality traits) that may affect expectations will be managed or accounted for would enhance the rigor of the experimental design.

3. **Challenges Related to fMRI and Pupillometry**: The integration of fMRI and pupillometry adds complexity to the methodology. While the proposal mentions the use of psychophysiological interaction analyses, it could benefit from a more detailed discussion of potential challenges in interpreting simultaneous fMRI and pupillometry data, especially concerning how physiological responses will be aligned temporally with the learning task.

4. **Implications of Findings**: While the proposal outlines potential implications for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), it could delve deeper into how the research findings might translate into specific interventions or therapeutic methods. For instance, it would be helpful to discuss possible practical applications or strategies that could arise from understanding biases in reward learning.

### Conclusion:

Overall, this grant proposal presents a well-structured and innovative approach to investigating the interplay between prior expectations and learning. The incorporation of behavioral, computational, and neuroimaging methods creates a solid foundation for potential breakthroughs in understanding cognitive processes and their implications for mental health treatment. By addressing the identified areas for improvement, particularly regarding sample size justification and methodological controls, the proposal can be further strengthened before final submission.
