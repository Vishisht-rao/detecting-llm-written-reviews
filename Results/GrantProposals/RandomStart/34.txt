**Review of Grant Proposal: "Diversity-stability relationships and coexistence: new theory and empirical tests"**

**Summary:**
The submitted proposal investigates the issue of the relationship between community diversity and the temporal stability of biomass and abundance in ecological communities. It aims to enhance our understanding of the demographic and population processes that influence stability and the connections between those processes and species coexistence. By utilizing long-term plant community datasets, statistical modeling, and developing new mechanistic models, the proposal seeks to bridge the gap between biodiversity–stability theory and coexistence theory.

**Intellectual Merit:**
The proposal presents a compelling research question that is both relevant and timely, especially in the context of rapid biodiversity loss and its implications for ecosystem stability. The proposed methodology is thorough, relying on established frameworks such as Integral Projection Models (IPMs) and consumer-resource models, and the integration of these approaches aims to provide novel insights into the factors influencing temporal stability.

The proposal effectively outlines the significance of its objectives, highlighting the importance of understanding how demographic and environmental variations contribute to community stability. Additionally, the potential to unify diversity-stability and coexistence theories represents a significant advancement in ecological research. The applicant’s plan to empirically test new theoretical insights using real-world data further strengthens the proposal.

**Broader Impacts:**
The broader impacts articulated in the proposal align well with current societal needs, particularly concerning conservation and understanding ecological dynamics in the face of climate change. The commitment to making research findings publicly accessible through GitHub and producing educational content via "Whiteboard Ecology" videos enhances its outreach potential. These educational initiatives aim to promote open science, improve public understanding of ecological concepts, and foster the next generation of ecologists with quantitative skills and familiarity with advanced modeling techniques.

**Training Objectives and Career Development:**
The proposal includes a well-defined plan for the applicant's professional development as an educator and researcher. The collaboration with experienced mentors in both biology and mathematics provides a strong support system for achieving the proposed training objectives. The focus on enhancing teaching through the integration of computer programming with ecological education is particularly noteworthy, as it addresses a critical gap in current undergraduate biology curricula.

**Data Management Plan:**
The data management plan is satisfactory, with clear strategies for code sharing and data accessibility. The reliance on publicly available datasets and the commitment to making analytical tools accessible promote transparency and reproducibility in ecological research.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
1. **Clarification of Statistical Methods:** While the proposal mentions using statistical models, a clearer explanation of the specific statistical techniques to be employed in analyzing the datasets would bolster confidence in the research design.

2. **Integration of Feedback Mechanism:** Incorporating mechanisms for peer feedback on research findings as they develop would enhance the scientific rigor of the project.

3. **Address Potential Limitations:** A more transparent discussion of the potential limitations of the proposed methodologies and datasets, as well as how the applicant plans to address these, would strengthen the proposal's overall robustness.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this grant proposal is well-conceived, addressing significant questions in ecology with a robust methodological approach and a clear plan for broader impacts. The applicant's commitment to education and public engagement, alongside the potential contributions to ecological theory, marks this as a proposal worthy of support. By elucidating the factors that underlie community stability, this research could significantly inform conservation practices and ecological management strategies in an era of environmental change.
