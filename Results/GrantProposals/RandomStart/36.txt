**Grant Proposal Review**

This submitted proposal investigates a critical problem at the intersection of phylogenetics and education, specifically addressing the integration of fossil data and extant taxon data for phylogenetic inferences while improving the retention of underrepresented minority (URM) students in STEM fields. The proposal presents a multifaceted approach to researching and educating within the field of systematic biology, utilizing the fossilized birth-death (FBD) model to enhance understanding of evolutionary processes.

**Strengths:**

1. **Transformative Research Objectives**: The research aims to advance methodologies in phylogenetic analysis by incorporating both molecular and morphological data through the FBD framework. The proposed use of posterior predictive methods to assess model adequacy is particularly innovative and addresses a significant gap in current phylogenetic practices. This could have wider implications beyond ants (Formicidae), benefiting researchers across various biological disciplines.

2. **Comprehensive Educational Plan**: The emphasis on a code-to-learn framework for undergraduate biology education is commendable. The proposal outlines a systematic investigation into whether computational methods can be incorporated without compromising biological understanding. This research into educational efficacy and retention strategies for URM students is vital in a field that often lacks diversity.

3. **Broader Impacts**: The proposal’s focus on retention of URM students is well justified and aligns with the increased emphasis on diversity and inclusion in educational initiatives. The integration of computational skills in biology is highly relevant in today’s data-driven research environment, and the structured approach to mentoring and support proposed for students is expected to foster a diverse scientific workforce.

4. **Collaborative Potential**: The proposal indicates collaborative opportunities with faculty at Southeastern and Louisiana State University, enhancing both resource sharing and student mentorship practices. This collaboration could bolster student research experiences and expand the educational impact of the project.

5. **Solid Preliminary Work**: The preliminary work indicates a clear understanding of the complexities involved in phylogenetic modeling and recognizes previous pitfalls in modeling character evolution. This foundation sets a strong stage for the proposed work and demonstrates the PI’s capability.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Budget Justification**: While the budget proposal outlines various necessary expenses, there could be clearer links between specific budget items and the planned work. For instance, the justification for new computing equipment (laptops, servers) could elaborate more on how this hardware directly supports the educational and research objectives, such as increased computational capacity for software development and research analysis.

2. **Retention Strategies Need Further Detail**: Although addressing the retention of URM students is a core part of the educational plan, the proposal could benefit from more detailed strategy outlines and success metrics. For instance, while stipends are provided, additional details on how mentorship relationships will be established and supported could strengthen this component.

3. **Dependency on Preliminary Results**: The proposal’s success hinges on the premise that computational learning can be integrated without loss of biological content. Experimental results from previous offerings are not yet fully available, which may pose a risk in justifying integration methodologies at a larger scale.

4. **Potential for Overlapping Objectives**: The proposed aims may have some overlap, particularly between research objectives and educational components. Additional clarification on how these two goals will be distinctly measured and evaluated would enhance the proposal’s clarity, helping reviewers to better understand the pathways toward evaluating both research and educational success.

**Recommendations:**

1. The PI should provide clearer justifications linking budget items to specific research and educational goals, ensuring that every expenditure is clearly framed within the context of how it supports achieving the proposed objectives.

2. Strengthen the description of student mentoring programs to include structured frameworks for sustaining relationships and assessing outcomes related to student success, retention, and integration into computational thinking.

3. Consider including contingency plans for evaluating the impact of educational strategies on student retention and academic performance, particularly given the dependency on early offerings’ success.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this proposal presents a compelling case for both significant advancements in the field of systematic biology through innovative data integration methods and meaningful progress in education that enhances diversity within the scientific community. With minor revisions addressing the recommendations above, this project has the potential for broad positive impacts in both theory and practice.
