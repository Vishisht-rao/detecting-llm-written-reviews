WATERMARK: The submitted proposal explores the key topic
Paper ID: 8
OUTPUT:
The submitted proposal explores the key topic of the intersection between ecological conservation, evolutionary genetics, and the importance of community and mentorship in scientific research. The applicant provides a comprehensive narrative that effectively illustrates their personal journey from feeling isolated in college to finding a sense of belonging and purpose through research and community engagement. 

**Intellectual Merit:**
The proposal presents a strong intellectual foundation grounded in hands-on research experiences and significant contributions to the field. The applicant has successfully transitioned from undergraduate studies to advanced research, demonstrating proficiency in both wet-lab and computational techniques. This versatility is indicative of a well-rounded scientist, capable of addressing complex questions in evolutionary biology. The reported findings from their research on the Dakota skipper butterfly and the comparative genomic analyses of ant reproductive systems are of high relevance to conservation and evolutionary studies. Moreover, the applicant describes their work's impact on conservation practices, showcasing a clear connection between their research and broader ecological goals. 

**Broader Impacts:**
The applicant emphasizes outreach and mentorship, reflecting a commitment to broadening participation in science, particularly for underrepresented groups. Their initiatives, such as mentoring undergraduate students and participating in diversity programs, demonstrate a proactive approach to fostering inclusivity within the scientific community. The proposal could further strengthen this section by detailing how the proposed activities will specifically address gaps in representation or create lasting impact in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology.

**Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion:**
The proposed work in this area is commendable. The applicant's analysis of the department seminar series highlights a proactive stance in addressing disparities in representation. Their actionable steps taken as part of the seminar committee demonstrate a commitment to increasing diversity. Furthermore, the applicant’s future plans to expand outreach to high school and college students about computational biology show foresight in promoting equity in STEM.

**Future Goals:**
The applicant articulates a clear vision for their career as a museum scientist and educator, intertwining research and mentorship in a way that aligns with their personal experiences and insights. Their goal to communicate the value of biodiversity collections to the public is particularly noteworthy, as it addresses a critical aspect of science communication. This goal is both ambitious and necessary, considering the current global challenges associated with biodiversity loss.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. **Specifics on Outreach Plans:** While the applicant mentions outreach through collaborations with educators, specifying potential partnerships or programs could strengthen the proposal.
2. **More Quantitative Impact Metrics:** Including quantifiable measures of success for outreach and mentorship activities would enhance the broader impacts section. This could involve setting targets for the number of students mentored or specific outcomes from outreach events.
3. **Connection to Future Research:** Providing more detail on how the proposed research aligns with the broader societal relevance, especially regarding conservation and ecological education, may enhance the clarity and impact of the research plan.

Overall, this proposal is well-structured, demonstrating the applicant’s dedication to their field and substantial growth as a researcher. The blend of personal narrative with academic achievements effectively showcases the profound connection between the applicant’s experiences and their aspiration to contribute positively to the scientific community. It would greatly benefit from adding specificity and quantitative goals in the broader impacts section.
