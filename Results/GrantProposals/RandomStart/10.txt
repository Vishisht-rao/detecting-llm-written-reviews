WATERMARK: This manuscript addresses the aspect
Paper ID: 10
OUTPUT:
This manuscript addresses the aspect of integrating land management practices with climate change modeling to provide valuable insights into the hydrologic dynamics of the western United States, specifically in Idaho. The proposed CAREER project combines experimental frameworks with existing modeling approaches to understand the complex interactions between human activities (land management practices) and natural systems (hydrology and regional climate). 

**Overall Assessment:**

1. **Intellectual Merit:**
   - The proposal outlines a clear significance in the intellectual domain by addressing a critical gap in understanding how management practices influence regional hydroclimate. The use of a dynamically coupled approach, although simplified through a "loose coupling" methodology, demonstrates a thoughtful balance between computational feasibility and research rigor.
   - The delineation of specific research questions is commendable, targeting the impacts of various management activities on key hydrological variables. This targeted approach aligns well with current issues faced by land management agencies, thus enhancing the relevance of the research.
   - The proposed collaboration with federal agencies and the engagement of stakeholders enhances the potential impact of the project. Strengthened ties to management practices will ensure that the findings have real-world applicability.

2. **Broader Impacts:**
   - The education plan is well-articulated and aims to improve climate literacy among K-12 educators in Idaho, which is vital given the recent trends in climate change. By using hands-on projects involving automated weather stations, the program promises to engage educators and their students meaningfully.
   - The focus on underserved populations in Idaho, specifically rural students, refugees, and Title I schools, positions this project as one that aims to broaden participation in STEM fields, which is a significant societal concern.
   - The sustainability considerations and long-term impact strategies articulated in the educational section provide a framework that increases confidence in the project's capacity for lasting outcomes.

3. **Research Design and Methodology:**
   - The decision to use existing models in a coupled framework illustrates careful planning and avoidance of redundant efforts, thereby saving resources and time. However, it's crucial to ensure that the simplifications in the modeling approach do not lead to significant oversights in capturing critical feedback mechanisms between human and natural systems.
   - The outlined workflow using the Envision modeling framework alongside the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is logical and well-prepared to facilitate substantial research outputs. Future research should aim at validating these models against observable data to build credibility.

4. **Writing and Clarity:**
   - The proposal is generally well structured and comprehensive. However, certain sections could benefit from greater clarity or conciseness to improve readability. For instance, consider simplifying the descriptions of modeling frameworks and technical processes for audiences who might not be experts in hydrological modeling.
   - There are minor grammatical and typographical errors that should be addressed to enhance the overall professionalism of the document.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- While the proposal effectively identifies objectives and methodologies, a detailed risk assessment regarding the integration of models should be included, specifically concerning potential barriers to computational and data interoperability.
- Greater emphasis on how success will be measured throughout the research would strengthen the proposal. Specific metrics tied to both the research outcomes and educational goals should be defined.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this grant proposal presents a substantial and potentially transformative research agenda that addresses critical issues in climate change and land management. Its combination of scientific inquiry and educational outreach is a strength that aligns with NSFâ€™s broader impacts criteria. With a few refinements and clarifications, it is likely to make a significant contribution to the field of hydrology and climate literacy in Idaho.
