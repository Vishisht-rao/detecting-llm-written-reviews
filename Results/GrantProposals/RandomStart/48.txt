**Review of Grant Proposal: "Submesoscale-Resolving Large Eddy Simulations Using Reduced Biogeochemical Models"**

**Overview:**
This submitted proposal examines the key aspect of integrating complex biogeochemical (BGC) models with high-fidelity large eddy simulations (LES) to enhance our understanding of submesoscale processes in the ocean. The investigators effectively address a pertinent scientific question regarding the interactions between turbulent mixing, biogeochemistry, and the implications for the ocean carbon cycle. The project has the potential to yield significant insights into the spatial distribution and dynamics of biogeochemical tracers, particularly in the context of climate change. 

**Intellectual Merit:**
The intellectual merit of the proposal is strong. The innovative approach of utilizing techniques from combustion research to reduce the complexity of existing BGC models is particularly noteworthy. The proposed integration of reduced models with LES on GPUs holds promise for advancing our understanding of small-scale turbulence and its influence on oceanic biogeochemical processes. The problem of tracer patchiness in the ocean is of significant importance, and this project aims to fill critical gaps in our understanding of the marine carbon cycle, thus contributing to the development of improved Earth System Models (ESMs). 

The proposal shows a clear connection between the methodology and the scientific applications. The research questions are well-defined, and the planned methods for addressing these questions through simulations of various physical scenarios are comprehensive and logically structured. 

**Broader Impacts:**
The proposal adequately addresses broader impacts, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and community engagement. The inclusion of mentorship and research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, particularly from under-represented backgrounds, is commendable. It is encouraging to see a focus on expanding outreach efforts to K–12 students and the general public, as the findings of this research are critical to understanding anthropogenic climate change. 

However, some aspects of the broader impacts section could be further expanded, particularly in terms of specific outreach strategies or potential partnerships with local education institutions that could enhance student engagement and community involvement.

**Response to Review Comments:**
The proposal effectively responds to previous review comments, which is a positive aspect. The incorporation of specific scientific hypotheses and a clear plan for involving undergraduates demonstrates a responsiveness that strengthens the proposal. The revisions to the broader impacts section, although improved, could use additional detail on how findings will be disseminated to the broader scientific community and the public to elevate awareness and understanding of the study’s implications.

**Research Questions:**
The research questions outlined in the proposal (Q1 - Q6) are relevant and focused on significant issues within the realm of ocean biogeochemistry and small-scale processes. However, further clarity regarding how specific hypotheses will be tested and what metrics will be used could enhance the robustness of the proposal.

**Methodology:**
The methodology proposed for model reduction is well-explained, and there is a clear trajectory for its implementation. The analyses of computational efficiency using GPUs will contribute significantly to the simulation capabilities of the proposed research. The use of unit problems and systematic validation of reduced models against full-scale models is an appropriate approach that will likely provide the necessary credibility and reliability of results.

**Concerns:**
While the proposal shines in many areas, there are some concerns that should be addressed:
1. **Clarity on Validation**: Further detail regarding how the validation of modeling results against observational data will be accomplished would strengthen the proposal. Explicitly defining the metrics and criteria for successful validation would be beneficial.
2. **Budget Justification**: Although the budget has been reduced, a detailed justification for the revised budget, particularly in regard to the decreasing cost for simulations and personnel support, would aid in understanding the funding request.
3. **Potential Risks**: Identifying potential challenges or risks in model reduction, integration, and the efficacy of simulations could further enhance the proposal's depth.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this proposal presents a well-structured and innovative approach to a significant scientific challenge in the oceanographic field. The integration of biogeochemical processes with high-resolution physical simulations represents an important advancement that could positively impact our understanding of the ocean carbon cycle. I recommend that this proposal be given strong consideration for funding, with the suggestions provided that may enhance its clarity and robustness.
