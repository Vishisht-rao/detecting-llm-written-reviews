WATERMARK: This manuscript focuses on an important context
Paper ID: 26
OUTPUT:
This manuscript focuses on an important context—the study of regime shifts in ecological systems and their implications for ecosystem management. The proposal led by Dr. Ernest at Utah State University presents a well-articulated research plan to experimentally investigate the characteristics and reversibility of regime shifts, particularly through a long-term manipulation of rodent populations in a Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem. The central questions addressed are timely and relevant, especially given the increasing frequency of rapid ecological changes due to anthropogenic influences.

### Strengths:
1. **Clear Objectives**: The proposal outlines specific and measurable research questions that aim to address significant gaps in the understanding of ecosystem dynamics and regime shifts. The four aims are logically structured and interconnected.

2. **Robust Experimental Design**: The use of an existing long-term study site with established manipulations allows for a unique experimental approach to assess regime shifts. The proposal to reverse manipulations on a subset of plots to monitor ecological responses is innovative and methodologically sound. It takes into account the complexities of interacting drivers, as well as the crucial aspect of hysteresis.

3. **Comprehensive Methodology**: The proposal employs statistical methods that are well-suited for the diverse types of data collected (multivariate and univariate). The combination of generalized additive modeling, canonical analysis of principal components, and mixed model approaches indicates a thorough understanding of how to analyze ecological data.

4. **Broader Impacts**: The proposal includes a well-defined section on broader impacts, particularly in terms of data publication, accessibility, recruitment of underrepresented groups, and outreach. The commitment to share data and create user-friendly software tools demonstrates a dedication to advancing scientific knowledge beyond the immediate research context.

5. **Interdisciplinary Training**: The training component emphasizes computational ecology and the inclusion of workshops led by recognized organizations. This enhances the educational value of the project and prepares future ecologists with relevant skills.

### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Further Justification of Hypotheses**: Although the hypotheses are well-articulated, providing additional context or preliminary data that support the anticipated outcomes would strengthen the proposal. For instance, citing specific previous experiments or studies that demonstrate similar dynamics in response to manipulations could bolster the rationale.

2. **Potential Limitations and Contingencies**: While the proposal outlines an ambitious experimental framework, it would benefit from a section discussing potential limitations — such as logistical challenges or ecological variability — and the contingency plans that would be implemented if the desired outcomes are not achieved.

3. **Engagement with Stakeholders**: The outreach efforts are commendable, but detailing how the results will be communicated to a broader audience, including non-academic stakeholders, could enhance the impact. Specific examples of planned workshops, presentations, or publications aimed at land management agencies would add depth.

4. **Long-Term Monitoring and Follow-up**: While the five-year post-manipulation monitoring period is reasonable, it may be beneficial to outline plans for longer-term follow-up studies or continuous monitoring to assess any delayed ecological responses or long-term adaptations by the ecosystem.

### Conclusion:
Overall, this grant proposal is well-constructed, addressing significant research questions with a solid experimental framework and clear broader impacts. The research has the potential to contribute valuable insights into the management of ecological systems in light of ongoing environmental changes. With a few adjustments to address the highlighted areas, the proposal will be positioned to make a meaningful contribution to the field of ecology and ecosystem management.
