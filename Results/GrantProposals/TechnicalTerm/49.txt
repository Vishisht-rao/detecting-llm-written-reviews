### Review of Grant Proposal by Sam Zorowitz

**Overall Summary:**
Sam Zorowitz's proposal to investigate how prior expectations influence learning biases represents an innovative and timely research question with significant implications for understanding cognitive processes and treatment strategies for psychological conditions. By employing a combination of behavioral experiments, computational modeling, and fMRI, the proposed study aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms underpinning the interactions between expectations and learning. The project's aims are ambitious, well-structured, and grounded in a strong theoretical framework.

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear Motivation and Research Questions:** The proposal begins with a compelling introduction that outlines the significance of the research question. The interplay between expectations and learning is critical for both cognitive theory and practical applications in mental health, making the proposed work relevant and impactful.

2. **Theoretical Framework:** The use of reinforcement learning (RL) as a framework provides a solid structure for the experiments. The inclusion of specific hypotheses (H1 through H3b) demonstrates a clear direction in research and sets measurable objectives for the study.

3. **Innovative Methodology:** The proposal outlines two distinct experiments that combine behavioral and neural measures. The decision to utilize a probabilistic learning task with self-report assessments is particularly strong, as it allows for a nuanced understanding of how expectations shape learning behavior over time.

4. **Interdisciplinary Approach:** The integration of computational modeling, fMRI, and pupillometry signifies an interdisciplinary approach that could yield a comprehensive understanding of the neural processes involved in learning biases. The confluence of these methodologies acknowledges the complexity of the brain's decision-making processes.

5. **Researcher Expertise and Institutional Support:** The proposal highlights the qualifications of the principal investigator and their advisors, which provides reassurance regarding the feasibility of the project. The noted availability of research facilities at Princeton enhances the appeal of the proposal.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Depth of Literature Review:** While various relevant studies are cited, a more extensive discussion of the existing literature on expectation and learning biases is warranted. This would better position the proposed research within the broader context of the field and could help clarify why the proposed experiments are necessary to resolve existing inconsistencies in the literature.

2. **Statistical Rigor:** Although Bayesian hierarchical modeling is a robust approach for analyzing individual differences, further elaboration on the specific statistical methodologies and analyses planned for the experiments would strengthen the proposal. Clarifying how these methods will address potential confounding variables related to expectations could enhance the design’s rigor.

3. **Clarity on Broader Impacts:** The broader impact section touches on the potential implications for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). However, further elaboration on how the proposed findings could operationalize these insights into practical interventions would be beneficial. How might the knowledge gained from this study specifically influence therapeutic practices or inform policy? Consider discussing more concrete applications of the results.

4. **"Meta-Black-Box Optimization" Consideration:** Given the intricate nature of computational modeling and individual variability, the proposal may benefit from discussing “meta-black-box optimization” techniques to refine model fitting and enhance the robustness of the results. This aspect could address interindividual differences in learning biases more effectively.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, Sam Zorowitz's grant proposal is a well-crafted and significant contribution to our understanding of learning biases influenced by expectations. The combination of thoughtful theoretical grounding, innovative methodologies, and the researcher's expertise indicates strong potential for meaningful findings. Addressing the outlined suggestions could further strengthen the proposal and clarify the transformative implications of this research.
