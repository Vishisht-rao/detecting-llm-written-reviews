**Grant Proposal Review: The Effects of Loss of Function Mutations Over Adaptive Trajectories in S. cerevisiae**

**Intellectual Merit: Excellent**

This proposal presents a well-constructed research plan to investigate the impact of genetic background on deleterious mutations in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. The framework is grounded in robust theoretical concepts, specifically exploring the dynamics of adaptive trajectories in relation to fitness landscapes. By focusing on loss of function (LOF) mutations, the applicant seeks to close a significant gap in our understanding of how deleterious mutations interact with adaptive processes in a microbe, a critical model organism in evolutionary biology.

The methodological approach is commendable, employing transposon mutagenesis and deep sequencing (Tn-seq) to systematically assess the fitness effects of a myriad of LOF mutations. The experimental evolution framework, combined with the creation of a “frozen fossil record,” presents an innovative strategy that promises to yield insights into the changing fitness effects of mutations as populations adapt, given the diversity of initial fitness backgrounds. The predictions made in this proposal are both clear and testable, reflecting a solid understanding of evolutionary theory and genetics.

The applicant’s strong background, accompanied by their affiliation with Dr. Michael Desai’s lab—known for its contributions and resources in experimental evolution—positions them favorably for the successful execution of this research. The integration of experimental and theoretical approaches to address questions of evolutionary dynamics showcases the proposal's potential for significant contributions to the field.

**Broader Impacts: Very Good**

The applicant demonstrates a strong commitment to science communication and outreach, evidenced by prior experiences such as the production of educational videos and interactive digital workshops. These efforts reflect a recognition of the importance of effectively engaging diverse audiences in science. However, the broader impacts section could be enhanced by providing more specific strategies on how to reach traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM. Future plans for outreach could better articulate the methods for fostering inclusion and accessibility in scientific education. While the applicant's informal science symposium effectively gathered diverse participants, delineating targeted goals for broader impacts would strengthen the proposal.

**Summary Comments**

Overall, this proposal presents an exciting research prospect with the potential to advance our understanding of evolutionary dynamics and the role of deleterious mutations in adaptation. The combination of rigorous experimental design, theoretical grounding, and the applicant's solid foundation in research and outreach makes this application particularly compelling.

While the intellectual merit is robust, the broader impacts could be enhanced by specifying future outreach goals, especially concerning underrepresented populations in STEM. The proposal would benefit from a clearer focus on how to translate past successes into impactful future initiatives. Despite these minor drawbacks, the overall strength of the project and the applicant’s capabilities warrant strong support for their candidacy for the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. 

In conclusion, this research is original and paradigm-shifting, with the high potential for transformative insights into evolutionary biology and its applications in public health, particularly in understanding the evolution of pathogens and cancerous populations. 

**Recommendation:** Strongly support the proposal with minor suggestions for enhancing broader impacts.
