**Title of Proposal:** Coevolutionary dynamics between snake venom and mammalian resistance: Insights from the Lesser Antilles

**Commendations:**

1. **Research Significance:** The proposal addresses a key question in evolutionary biologyâ€”the reciprocal interactions between predators and prey through coevolutionary dynamics. This study's investigation of venom resistance in the context of snake predation offers the potential to elucidate mechanisms of resistance that have not been thoroughly studied, particularly in the case of the opossum (Didelphis marsupialis) and its interactions with Bothrops spp. The focus on multiple mechanisms of resistance is an innovative approach that could significantly contribute to our understanding of evolutionary arms races.

2. **Unique Context:** The proposed research takes advantage of a unique geographical setting (the Lesser Antilles) that presents a natural laboratory for studying the divergence of venom resistance in relation to sympatry and allopatry. This setting, particularly with the historic context of recent mammalian invasions, allows for an exploration of evolutionary processes on different time scales, which is an important consideration in coevolutionary studies.

3. **Methodological Rigor:** The outlined methodology, including the use of flurometric proteolytic assays and the intent to investigate both target modification of Von Willebrand Factor (vWF) and serum inhibition, suggests a comprehensive approach to addressing the research questions. Collaboration with local researchers further strengthens the feasibility of the fieldwork component.

4. **Broader Impacts:** The proposal effectively highlights broader impacts, emphasizing educational outreach and the encouragement of women in science. The investigator's commitment to diversity and public engagement in science is commendable and could greatly benefit the local community and future generations of scientists.

**Concerns:**

1. **Clarity and Structure:** The proposal tends to be densely packed with information, making it occasionally difficult to follow the narrative thread. A clearer structure with distinct sections for each hypothesis, methodology, and expected outcomes would enhance readability and comprehension. Specifically, multiple hypotheses presented in a single paragraph may lead to confusion about the sequential testing and interpretation of results.

2. **Conceptual Framework:** The proposal could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the theoretical framework underpinning the hypotheses. While the hypotheses are compelling, further contextualizing them within existing literature and evolutionary theory would strengthen the proposal. Explicitly connecting how this work will advance general understanding of coevolutionary dynamics is crucial.

3. **Potential Limitations:** The proposal lacks a discussion regarding the potential challenges or limitations associated with fieldwork, particularly in the Lesser Antilles context. Factors such as environmental variability, availability of study populations, and logistics of sample collection should be addressed to ensure a realistic scope for the proposed research.

4. **Terminology and Ambiguity:** The word "hirid" appears to be an inadvertent typo or misplaced term within the context of this document. It is crucial to maintain scientific terminology accurately, as it affects the proposal's professionalism and clarity. 

5. **Dedicated Analysis of Non-proteolytic Factors:** While the study aims to include both proteolytic and non-proteolytic factors in assessing resistance, the latter might not receive sufficient emphasis relative to the proteolytic components. A justification for the proportional focus on each factor would be beneficial.

**Overall Evaluation:**
This grant proposal presents an intriguing and promising research plan that could yield significant insights into the dynamics of snake venom and prey resistance. While the foundational ideas are strong and the methodology coherent, enhancing clarity, addressing potential limitations, and providing a robust contextual framework are essential for improving the proposal's overall impact. The commitment to broader impacts is laudable and positions the research within a community-focused paradigm. Addressing the identified areas for improvement would greatly strengthen this proposal's candidacy for funding.
