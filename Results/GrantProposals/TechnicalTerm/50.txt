### Review of Grant Proposal: "Investigating the Value of Automatically-Gathered Software Impact Data"

#### Overview:
The proposal submitted by Heather Piwowar and Jason Priem aims to tackle the significant challenge of underutilization and under-recognition of research software by developing automated methods for gauging the impact of software products. This project seeks to gather meaningful metrics of software's impact, which could incentivize researchers to make their software more available for reuse, enhancing the overall productivity of research.

#### Strengths:
1. **Timeliness and Relevance**: The proposal addresses a contemporary issue within the research communityâ€”how to measure and maximize the use of research software. With increasing digitization and the emphasis on reproducibility in research, this project is timely and could significantly influence best practices in software sharing and impact assessment.

2. **Clear Objectives**: The proposal outlines clear research questions and specific objectives concerning the capability of automated tracking tools to gather metrics that researchers find meaningful for inclusion in their grant, tenure, and promotion applications. This focus on measurable outcomes reflects a well-structured approach.

3. **Innovative Approach**: The integration of various existing methods, from text mining to social media analysis, offers an innovative angle on automated impact tracking. The proposal promises to enhance the open-source ImpactStory web application to achieve this, demonstrating a commitment to building on existing platforms.

4. **Broader Impacts**: The stated broader impacts of fostering a culture of software reuse and establishing clear impact assessment metrics for software products are commendable. The open-source approach and commitment to community engagement will likely cultivate collaborations and knowledge sharing, enhancing the software ecosystem.

5. **Engagement Plan**: The proposal includes a detailed engagement plan to involve a diverse advisory group of researchers. This community-driven strategy is advantageous as it aligns the outputs of the project with the needs and feedback of potential users.

6. **Results from Prior NSF Support**: The proposal includes a section addressing prior support, which is particularly relevant given that both principal investigators are new to NSF funding. This transparency and acknowledgment of their experience and capabilities help establish credibility.

#### Weaknesses:
1. **Risks and Challenges**: While the proposal identifies several potential risks, such as issues with gaining text mining rights from publishers and technological hurdles, it does not present a comprehensive risk mitigation strategy. More information on how the PIs intend to navigate these challenges would strengthen the proposal.

2. **Budget Justification**: The budget, totaling $297,500, includes a significant allocation for indirect costs and consultant support, which may raise questions among reviewers regarding the cost-effectiveness of the proposed strategies. A more detailed justification for these costs, especially regarding the anticipated returns on investment and the specific outcomes attributable to the consultants, should be included.

3. **Lack of Preliminary Data**: The proposal lacks preliminary data demonstrating that automatically-gathered metrics can indeed provide valuable insights into the impact of research software. Engaging in preliminary studies or pilot projects prior to submitting could clarify the validity of the research hypothesis.

4. **Broad Research Focus**: The broad scope of the proposal may dilute efforts. Focusing initially on a narrower segment of research software or particular disciplines may allow for more comprehensive findings that can later be expanded to broader fields.

#### Conclusion:
The proposal presents a compelling case for the need to improve the visibility and impact recognition of research software. With its innovative plans for automated impact tracking, it stands to contribute significantly to the research community's knowledge base and practice. However, addressing the identified weaknesses related to risk management, budget justification, and preliminary data will be crucial for enhancing the proposal's viability. Overall, this proposal has the potential to advance understanding in an important area of research methodology and should be considered for funding with attention to the stated concerns.
