OUTPUT:
**Review of Grant Proposal: "Using Metacommunity Theory to Assess the Impact of Multi-Species Interactions on Gut Microbial Assembly"**

**Overall Impression:**
The proposed research is ambitious and addresses a crucial gap in our understanding of the role that ecological connectivity plays in gut microbiome assembly and, by extension, its effects on host health and ecosystem function. The integration of metacommunity theory and the focus on multi-species interactions is timely and innovative, and the proposed methods are well-conceived. The applicant demonstrates a clear commitment to inclusivity in STEM through outreach and mentorship, which strengthens the broader impacts of the proposal.

**Strengths:**

1. **Strong Intellectual Foundation:** 
   The proposal provides a sound theoretical framework based on metacommunity theory. It appropriately situates the research within the broader ecological and evolutionary contexts, highlighting the interactions between biotic and abiotic factors on gut microbiome dynamics.

2. **Innovative Approach:** 
   The design of creating an artificial metacommunity with multiple species of tadpoles presents a novel method to explore interspecies interactions and their impact on microbial assembly. The emphasis on social dynamics and the consequences for microbial diversity under stressful environmental conditions reflects a thoughtful and innovative approach.

3. **Methodological Rigor:** 
   The experimental design, including the use of varied interaction barriers, and the detailed statistical analysis proposed are commendable. The applicant clearly outlines the steps for data collection and analysis, indicating a robust plan to assess the hypotheses.

4. **Broader Impacts:** 
   The commitment to K-12 outreach and fostering underrepresented groups in STEM is highly commendable. The proposed development of a teaching module and mentorship efforts provide substantial broader impacts, aligning well with current funding agency priorities regarding diversity and inclusion.

5. **Collaborative Environment:** 
   The collaboration with leading experts in the field provides a solid mentorship backbone for the applicant. The resources available at the University of Pittsburgh further enhance the feasibility of the proposed research.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Clarification on "Peeling":** 
   The applicant discusses microbiome changes extensively but could benefit from a concise explanation of how "peeling" (the gradual separation of microbial taxa or shifts in community structure) specifically applies to their research. Expanding this section could clarify the implications of their findings on our understanding of gut health and disease resistance.

2. **Unforeseen Challenges:** 
   While the proposal outlines experimental approaches comprehensively, it would strengthen the application to include a discussion of potential challenges or limitations of the proposed methodologies and how the applicant plans to address these issues. For example, how the integrity of microbial communities will be maintained in the face of environmental stressors could be elaborated upon.

3. **Long-Term Impact and Transition to Independence:** 
   The proposal lays a solid groundwork for explaining the applicant's long-term goals. However, more specific details on how the outcomes will transition into practical applications in conservation or management of amphibian populations could enhance the broader relevance of the work.

4. **Data Management Plan:** 
   While the plan is generally solid, including specific protocols for dealing with compromised samples (e.g., if microbial DNA extraction fails) and a more detailed description of the data-sharing process post-publication could improve transparency and reproducibility.

**Conclusion:**
This proposal tackles a significant area of ecological research through a systematic and thoughtful approach that integrates experimental design, conservation, and education. While some areas could use further clarification or expansion, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. The proposed research promises to provide valuable insights into the mechanics of gut microbiome dynamics within ecological contexts and has significant implications for both theoretical and applied ecology. Overall, I recommend this proposal for funding with revisions to address the noted areas for improvement.
