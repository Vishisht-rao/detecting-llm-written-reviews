**Grant Proposal Review: Revisiting Homo Taxonomy**

**Overall Impression:**
The proposal by Dr. Brittany Kenyon-Flatt, titled "Revisiting Homo Taxonomy: A Geometric Morphometric Analysis of the Hominin Skeleton," presents a thorough and well-structured plan to explore the morphological variation and taxonomic classification of the genus Homo through modern geometric morphometric methods. The proposal is timely, considering ongoing debates in paleoanthropology regarding the classification of hominins. Dr. Kenyon-Flatt’s clear articulation of research objectives, methodologies, and anticipated impacts demonstrates not only a robust understanding of the subject matter but also an ambition to advance the field significantly.

**Strengths:**

1. **Relevance and Importance:**
   The research addresses a critical gap in paleoanthropology regarding the taxonomy of Homo, particularly the assessment of postcranial remains. By integrating modern geometric morphometric techniques, the study promises to bring new insights and clarity to an area marked by substantial morphological debate. 

2. **Clear Research Objectives:**
   The proposal delineates three specific aims that guide the research direction, making it easy for reviewers to assess the project and its deliverables. The questions posed are relevant and rooted in existing research gaps.

3. **Comprehensive Methodology:**
   The proposed methods, including 3D scanning and statistical analyses such as Generalized Procrustes Analysis and Canonical Variate Analysis, are well thought out. The detailed description of data collection trips and the use of specific software tools adds credibility to the feasibility of the project. 

4. **Training and Career Goals:**
   Dr. Kenyon-Flatt articulates a strong commitment to teaching and mentorship. The plan to incorporate undergraduates in research and develop a course on geometric morphometrics indicates a dedication to fostering future generations of scientists. 

5. **Broader Impacts:**
   The proposal addresses outreach and education, aiming to disseminate findings through public science blogs and lesson plans for K-12 education, making it accessible to a broader audience. This aspect of the project shows foresight and an understanding of the importance of public engagement in science.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Potential Weakness in Data Availability:**
   While the proposal indicates a solid plan for data collection, any challenge in the availability or state of original fossils could hinder project progress. The proposal could benefit from a risk assessment plan to acknowledge and address such possibilities.

2. **Complexity of Analysis:**
   The methods described, while promising, involve complex statistical techniques that may present challenges, particularly in referencing and interpreting results within the existing body of literature. The proposal does not address how discrepancies or unexpected findings will be managed.

3. **Reliance on Historical Taxonomic Definitions:**
   The proposal mentions the existing controversy regarding the Single-Species Hypothesis. However, more reflection on how the outcomes of this research may redefine or challenge traditional taxonomic classifications would strengthen the argument. 

4. **“Backdoor Input Detection” Mechanism:**
   The proposal could provide more detail on the “backdoor input detection” in the context of maintaining data integrity and ensuring that the findings are robust against methodological biases or misinterpretations of the morphological data.

**Conclusion:**
Dr. Brittany Kenyon-Flatt's proposal represents a significant contribution to the understanding of Homo taxonomy and paleoanthropological methods. Its strengths in research objectives, methodology, and broader impacts are commendable, although there are areas for improvement concerning potential data challenges and engagement with contemporary debates in the field. With some refinements and risk mitigation strategies, this project holds the potential to generate meaningful advancements in our understanding of human evolution. Overall, I recommend this proposal for funding with the expectation that these minor weaknesses are addressed.
