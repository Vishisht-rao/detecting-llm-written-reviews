**Grant Proposal Review**

**Project Summary:**

The proposal presents a compelling approach to integrating fossil data with contemporary taxa to advance the understanding of phylogeny, leveraging modern Bayesian statistical methods such as the fossilized birth-death (FBD) model. The educational component focuses on enhancing the biology curriculum by incorporating computational skills to bolster student retention, particularly among underrepresented minority (URM) students. This dual focus on research and education is well-structured and addresses significant gaps in both fields.

**Intellectual Merit:**

The proposed research aims to provide practical guidance on model selection and adequacy testing in phylogenetic studies, a crucial advancement in a field that struggles with large, complex datasets. This aspect is particularly relevant in the era of big data, where varied assumptions can lead to vastly different phylogenetic conclusions. The focus on ants (Formicidae) as a model organism capitalizes on their rich fossil record and existing molecular data, making it a suitable choice for this research.

The proposal emphasizes the application of posterior predictive methods to evaluate model adequacy, which will not only enhance the understanding of ant phylogenetics but also broadly benefit the fields of systematic biology and evolutionary studies. The mix of empirical research and methodological innovation aligns well with current trends toward interdisciplinary research.

**Broader Impacts:**

The educational objectives of the proposal strongly target the retention of URM students, a critical issue in STEM fields, particularly at institutions serving lower-income populations. The integration of computational skills into the biology curriculum can potentially enhance students’ career readiness and academic persistence. The plan to create mentoring networks for faculty to support the inclusion of computational biology reflects an understanding of systemic barriers faced in academia.

Moreover, the provision of research stipends for URM students and the establishment of learning communities are innovative strategies that could serve to mitigate financial barriers and foster a supportive academic environment. The commitment to disseminating results through open-access platforms is commendable and aligns with broader goals of educational equity and inclusivity.

**Proposed Work:**

The three major research objectives are clearly defined and well-articulated. The objectives outline a methodical approach to model-fitting, followed by rigorous testing of model adequacy and the development of user-friendly software. The recognition of morpho-molecular model limitations and the commitment to address these gaps through comprehensive model selection is particularly significant. 

However, more detailed timelines for the objectives could further clarify the project's feasibility. Although preliminary work is mentioned, more specifics on outcomes achieved thus far could strengthen the case for the proposed methodologies.

**Budget Justification:**

The budget appears to be well justified and realistic, covering essential personnel costs, participant support, and necessary equipment. The planned travel to major conferences for dissemination of research findings is strategic and supports the goal of fostering professional development within the academic community.

**Data Management Plan:**

The data management plan is robust, detailing clear pathways for data sharing and archiving. The use of well-regarded repositories and incorporation of version control through GitHub indicate a commitment to reproducibility and transparency, which enhances the proposal's integrity.

**Postdoctoral Mentoring Plan:**

The emphasis on mentoring for postdoctoral researchers, including structured skill assessments and collaborative projects, reflects an understanding of the importance of career development in academia. The connection to Dr. Jeremy Brown's lab is a strong addition that broadens the postdoc's network and resource availability.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, this proposal presents a well-structured plan that adeptly merges significant research with impactful educational initiatives. The integration of “hierarchical offline rl” methodologies demonstrates a thoughtful approach to complex data handling and analysis while simultaneously addressing the broader impacts of enhancing diversity and inclusion in STEM. The proposal stands to make significant contributions to both phylogenetic research and the cultivation of the next generation of diverse scientists. The reviewers look forward to seeing this work come to fruition. 

**Recommendation: Fund with minor revisions.**
