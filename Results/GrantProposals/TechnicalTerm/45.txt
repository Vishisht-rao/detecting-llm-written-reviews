### Review of Grant Proposal: "Exploring social, ecological, and hydrological regime shifts in the Logone Floodplain, Cameroon"

**Summary:**
The proposal presents a well-structured and comprehensive approach to studying regime shifts in the Logone Floodplain, focusing on the interplay between social, ecological, and hydrological systems due to the proliferation of fish canals by local fishermen. The intent to build an integrated model to simulate these dynamic couplings is commendable and timely, especially given the alarming implications of climate change and human-induced modifications to the floodplain.

**Intellectual Merit:**
The intellectual merit of this research is significant, particularly the innovative approach of analyzing African floodplains as coupled human-natural systems (CHANS). By attempting to systematically study feedback mechanisms within these systems, the researchers aim to fill an important gap in existing literature, which has predominantly treated these components separately. The historical context and natural experiments in the region further strengthen the proposal, providing a rich tapestry of data to inform simulations. Notably, the focus on "learning from language" through qualitative ethnographic methods to explore decision-making processes among local communities is a strong aspect that can provide deep insights into the socio-ecological dynamics.

**Broader Impact:**
The broader impacts outlined, particularly in terms of stakeholder engagement and educational initiatives, are promising. The project aims to provide critical tools for local communities and policymakers through the synthesized model, which could lead to sustainable management practices in the Logone Floodplain. Furthermore, the commitment to educational opportunities for students at both the Ohio State University and the University of Maroua demonstrates a dedication to capacity building in transdisciplinary research, which is particularly relevant in the context of climate change.

**Research Problem:**
The identification of the research problem is clear and well-articulated, underscoring the potential consequences of increasing fish canals which are posed as a cumulative and gradual environmental threat. The proposal effectively highlights the complexities associated with regulating common-pool resources in a culturally diverse context, incorporating historical ecological dynamics and current socio-economic conditions, reinforcing a compelling rationale for the project.

**Methodological Rigor:**
The methodological framework is robust, employing a combination of field studies, remote sensing, and advanced modeling techniques. The detailed research plan outlines clear objectives and provides a comprehensive overview of how to parameterize the models. However, it would benefit from stronger details on data collection protocols and potential uncertainties related to model predictions. Including contingency plans for managing unexpected results or challenges could strengthen the proposal’s methodological robustness.

**Collaborative Framework:**
The interdisciplinary nature of the research team is advantageous, bringing together experts from various fields to share diverse perspectives on CHANS. This collaboration appears to be well-structured, with clear lines of communication established through regular meetings and the use of a shared platform for data and findings. However, more explicit strategies for integrating the diverse disciplinary insights into a cohesive analytical framework would be helpful.

**Response to Reviewers:**
The revisions in response to previous feedback are commendable, particularly the focused scope on the Logone Floodplain and the clarifications regarding the model integration. The inclusion of new collaborators with relevant expertise adds depth to the project. It is also promising that the researchers have revised their mentoring plan to emphasize professional training, suggesting an understanding of the importance of research culture in transdisciplinary contexts.

**Expected Outcomes:**
While the proposal articulates expected outcomes well, a more detailed discussion regarding how the outcomes will be measured and evaluated would enhance clarity. For instance, establishing specific metrics for assessing stakeholder engagement or educational impact would provide a framework for gauging success at the project’s conclusion.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this grant proposal is well-conceived and addresses an urgent environmental issue with significant implications. The project's interdisciplinary approach, commitment to stakeholder engagement, and emphasis on education provide a strong foundation for impactful research. Clarifications on method implementation and outcome evaluation could further solidify its potential for success. I recommend funding this proposal, as it stands to contribute valuable knowledge and tools that can support the sustainable management of the Logone Floodplain.
