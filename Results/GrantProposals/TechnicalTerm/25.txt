**Review of Grant Proposal: "Developing Groups and Their Response to Anthropogenic Change"**

**Summary:**
The proposed research by Delia S. Shelton aims to investigate the effects of human-induced rapid environmental change (HIREC) on group dynamics using zebrafish as a model organism. The focus is on understanding how social structures within animal groups develop and respond to anthropogenic stressors. The project employs both empirical and computational methods to explore three primary aims: the organizing principles of groups, the relationship between individual phenotypes and group positions, and the resilience of social ties under perturbations.

**Strengths:**

1. **Timeliness and Relevance:**
   The issue of anthropogenic change presents a significant threat to biodiversity, making this research timely and relevant to current ecological concerns. The proposal effectively addresses a notable gap in the literature regarding mid-level group responses to such changes.

2. **Integration of Disciplines:**
   The interdisciplinary approach that combines behavioral ecology, sensory physiology, and computational modeling through agent-based modeling (ABM) is commendable. This integration can provide innovative insights into the dynamics of social groups.

3. **Broader Impacts:**
   The proposal outlines a well-defined plan for community engagement and outreach, particularly targeting underrepresented groups in STEM. This includes collaboration with local initiatives and educational programs, which contribute to broadening participation actively.

4. **Strong Sponsorship:**
   The expertise of the sponsoring scientists, Dr. Dennis Higgs and Dr. Jens Krause, provide credible mentorship in sensory ecology and social networks, respectively. Their involvement is likely to enhance the quality of the research due to their established reputations and networks in the field.

5. **Clear Objectives and Methodologies:**
   The proposal articulates clear research objectives and includes a comprehensive methodological framework with specific aims and expected outcomes. The use of high-throughput sensory and social assays is well-justified, as is the methodological choice of utilizing zebrafish for this research.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Preliminary Data:**
   While the proposal is ambitious, it could benefit from providing some preliminary data or results that support the proposed hypotheses and method choices. This data would enhance the credibility of the proposed approaches and predictions outlined for each aim.

2. **Risk Assessment and Ethical Values:**
   The proposal mentions the environmental disturbances and their impact on zebrafish but lacks a detailed discussion on the potential ethical implications of such experiments. It is crucial to address how the research adheres to "ethical values" regarding animal welfare, especially in studies involving sensory impairment and human-induced stressors. A more explicit ethics statement would strengthen this aspect.

3. **Broader Impacts Evaluation:**
   Although a plan for broader impacts is presented, the metrics for assessing the effectiveness of outreach activities could be more defined. Specific indicators of success (e.g., increased participation rates, feedback mechanisms) would provide clarity on the project outcomes and their long-term effects on engagement and representation in STEM.

4. **Potential Challenges:**
   The proposal could expand on potential project challenges and limitations, such as logistical issues in coordinating research at multiple sites or unforeseen outcomes from the experimental disturbances. A risk mitigation strategy could solidify the feasibility of the research timeline.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this grant proposal presents a well-structured research plan with significant implications for understanding group dynamics in the face of environmental change. The candidate's commitment to increasing diversity in STEM, paired with a robust mentorship plan, indicates that this project is not only scientifically valuable but also socially responsible. Addressing the identified weaknesses, particularly concerning ethical considerations and the evaluation of broader impacts, would enhance the proposalâ€™s depth and potential for success. 

In conclusion, with minor revisions to strengthen sections on preliminary data, ethical values, and broader impacts, this proposal holds great promise and could make meaningful contributions to both the academic community and societal engagement in science.
