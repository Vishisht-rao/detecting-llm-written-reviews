**Review of Grant Proposal: "Computer Science Meets Anthropology: A Novel Approach for Reconstructing Locomotion from Fossil Human Footprints"**

**Overview:**

This grant proposal, authored by Dr. Kevin G. Hatala, presents an innovative interdisciplinary research project aimed at reconstructing locomotion patterns from fossil human footprints using advanced techniques in experimental biomechanics and machine learning. The proposal is commendable for its ambition to bridge computer science, anthropology, and biomechanics in order to provide new insights into the evolutionary history of human bipedalism.

**Intellectual Merit:**

The intellectual merit of this project is robust. It tackles a significant gap in our understanding of human evolution, specifically the mechanisms of bipedal locomotion. The idea of employing fossil footprints to provide insights into locomotor patterns is compelling, especially in light of the limitations of traditional methods that rely primarily on skeletal morphology. By utilizing novel data collection methods such as X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM) and real-time dense 3D scene modeling, the PI seeks to elucidate the biomechanical processes behind footprint formation in unprecedented detail. 

The use of machine learning techniques to analyze the extensive data generated is particularly noteworthy. The application of these computational methods to biological data reflects a "computational efficiency" that has the potential to transform paleoanthropological research. This project could set a precedent for future studies at the intersection of computer science and biological anthropology, leading to the establishment of new subfields.

While the proposal demonstrates a solid understanding of current research gaps and proposes an original approach, it could benefit from a more explicit discussion of how the results will be validated and compared with existing models. The inclusion of a timeline for expected outcomes and potential challenges could strengthen the application further.

**Broader Impacts:**

The broad impacts outlined in this proposal are well-articulated and significant. The engagement with the Smithsonian Institution’s Human Origins Program and the plans to disseminate findings to diverse audiences ensure that the project will have a wide-reaching impact beyond academia. 

The commitment to training students from historically underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines through the Trachtenberg Scholars Program is commendable and indicates a strong commitment to fostering diversity in the sciences. 

The proposal also emphasizes accessible public engagement through lectures and interactive exhibits, which align well with the NSF's mission to promote public understanding of scientific research.

**Methodology:**

The methodology presented is thorough and includes innovative approaches that enhance the project's feasibility. The two-phase investigation for visualizing foot formation—subsurface and above-surface—demonstrates a robust design that takes advantage of cutting-edge technologies. The experimental setup is thoughtfully constructed to provide comprehensive data on how footprints are formed and what those shapes reveal about locomotion patterns.

However, while the proposed methodologies are promising, the proposal could benefit from a clearer discussion of how data from the experiments will inform model creation and validation. Providing more detail on the machine learning algorithms and how they will be tailored to suit the specific requirements of this paleoanthropological data could add clarity.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the proposal presents an exciting interdisciplinary project with the potential for substantial contributions to both anthropology and computer science. The integration of innovative technologies and methodologies is a significant strength. There is a clear potential for advancements in understanding human evolution, especially in the context of bipedalism.

To enhance the proposal's impact, further elaboration on validation methods for the results, as well as a detailed risk assessment regarding potential challenges, would be beneficial. Additionally, any acknowledgment of the potential limitations of machine learning models in this context should be addressed.

In conclusion, this proposal aligns well with the objectives of the NSF SBE Interdisciplinary Postdoctoral Research Fellowship program and merits support for its transformative potential.
