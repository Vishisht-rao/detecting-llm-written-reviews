### Review of Grant Proposal: "CAREER: Pastoral Management of Open Access: The Emergence of a Complex Adaptive System"

#### Overview
The proposal by Mark Moritz outlines a comprehensive research plan to explore how mobile pastoralists in the Logone floodplain of Cameroon effectively manage grazing resources in a seemingly open-access system. The proposal successfully integrates complexity theory with ethnographic, spatial, and modeling approaches to investigate a pressing social-ecological issue. It also aims to contribute to education, particularly targeting underrepresented minority students.

#### Intellectual Merit
The intellectual contributions of this project are significant, particularly through its application of complexity theory to the examination of pastoral management systems. The proposal articulates three major theoretical contributions:

1. **Emerging Complexity in Open Access**: The framing of pastoral management as an emergent complex adaptive system is a novel approach that challenges prevailing notions of "tragedy of the commons." The inclusion of individual decision-making and social networks in forming emergent structures is particularly compelling.
 
2. **Theorizing Property Regimes**: The proposal seeks to bridge the gap between open access and common property theories, emphasizing the nuances that exist in real-world scenarios. This effort to theorize the "grey" areas between these concepts adds depth to existing frameworks.

3. **Structuration of Mobile Society**: Utilizing Giddens' theory of structuration to assess how social practices and emergent structures coalesce in the management of pastoral mobility is innovative and promises to yield richer insights into social order within fluid environments.

These contributions not only provide a fresh theoretical lens for understanding pastoral systems but also enhance the discourse surrounding resource management in complex adaptive systems.

#### Broader Impacts
The project emphasizes training the next generation of scientists and policy-makers, which is a vital aspect of broader impacts. The commitment to recruiting minority students is commendable, reflecting an awareness of the need for diversity in the sciences. The focus on building local capacity through collaboration with CARPA (Centre d’Appui à la Recherche et au Pastoralisme) aligns well with sustainable development goals and offers a practical avenue for the application of research findings.

Moreover, the plan to produce policy briefs and conduct workshops to educate practitioners about emerging management systems demonstrates a strong public engagement component. This could potentially influence broader pastoral development strategies across West Africa.

#### Research Design
The methodological framework of integrating spatial analysis, ethnographic study, and modeling is robust. Each phase is clearly delineated, enhancing the collaborative aspect of the project. The use of multi-agent simulations allows for testing hypotheses related to coordination among pastoralists—a contemporary approach consistent with advanced computational methods.

Additionally, the proposal's commitment to applying "unsupervised learning; video object learning" techniques in conjunction with traditional ethnographic methodologies further demonstrates a forward-thinking approach to analyzing complex social-ecological systems. The use of participatory mapping and consensus analysis is also an excellent choice to ground the research in local knowledge and practices.

However, more detailed approaches around the data collection timeline could strengthen the proposal. Clarifying how iterative adjustments based on preliminary findings will be incorporated could enhance the adaptability of the research design.

#### Conclusion
Overall, Mark Moritz's grant proposal is well-written, logically structured, and presents a significant contribution to understanding pastoral systems through the lens of complexity theory. It aligns empirical research closely with theoretical advancements, and the proposed educational component is laudable. Enhancing detail on the adaptability of the methodologies and solidifying the practical implications of the findings could elevate the proposal further. The initiative addressed in this research holds great promise for both academic advancement and real-world application in sustainable pastoral management. 

### Grade: Excellent 

### Recommendations for Improvement:
1. Provide additional details on adaptive methodologies in response to preliminary findings.
2. Clarify how the findings will be communicated to policymakers beyond workshops, engaging a wider audience.
3. Consider the implications of external factors such as climate change on the emergent management systems being studied.
