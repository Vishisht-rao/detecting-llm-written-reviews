**Review of Grant Proposal: Materials and Workshops for Cyberinfrastructure Education in Biology**

**General Overview:**
The proposal outlines an essential initiative aimed at bridging the educational divide in computational skills among biologists. It reacts to an increasingly critical need for education in computational biology, providing a well-structured plan that includes extending existing training materials, conducting workshops, developing assessment tools, and fostering cross-center collaborations.

**Strengths:**
1. **Relevance and Timeliness:** The need for computational training in biology is well-established and echoed through conferences and community feedback. This proposal is timely and could significantly impact training programs across biological sciences.
   
2. **Comprehensive Plan:** The proposal identifies specific areas for improvement in existing materials (Software Carpentry and ANGUS) and proposes clear strategies to augment these offerings, including the creation of modular resources and asynchronous learning opportunities.

3. **Collaborative Approach:** The collaboration with other centers such as NESCent and iPlant enhances the project's potential impact. By leveraging existing networks and expertise, the proposal stands to create a robust framework for training across multiple institutions.

4. **Assessment Focus:** The emphasis on developing rigorous assessment materials is commendable and demonstrates a commitment to evidence-based education. The inclusion of evaluation tools from the Software Carpentry workshops indicates a data-driven approach to measuring success.

5. **Creative Commons Licensing:** Ensuring all educational materials are open-source under a Creative Commons-Attribution license promotes accessibility and broad usage, aligning with contemporary educational practices aimed at democratization of knowledge.

**Concerns:**
1. **Granularity of Material Development:** While the proposal broadly addresses the need for content across varying skill levels, it might benefit from a more explicit breakdown of how the new materials will cater to the "novice to expert" spectrum in biological computation, especially for those starting with little background.

2. **"Poisoning" of Workshop Content:** The proposal should be cautious of the "poisoning" effect â€“ where certain advanced topics overwhelm novices due to the rapid introduction of complex concepts without sufficient grounding in basics. It's vital to ensure that the foundational aspects of computational biology are adequately covered to prevent discouragement among beginners.

3. **Sustainability of Efforts:** While the proposal focuses on creating and delivering materials, it would strengthen the argument to include how these efforts will be sustained beyond the duration of the funding period. Will there be follow-up workshops or an ongoing support network to ensure continued education?

4. **Quantifying Impact:** Though assessment strategies are mentioned, the proposal could be improved by articulating specific metrics or outcomes anticipated from both participant feedback and longitudinal studies on skill acquisition. Defining these metrics early will facilitate better tracking of progress and areas needing adjustment.

5. **Scalability of Workshops:** The proposal anticipates high demand for workshops, which is realistic, but it should better address how to scale these training sessions without compromising quality. What backup plans are in place if the initial interest exceeds expectations?

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the proposal presents a thoughtful and necessary plan to advance computational biology education. Addressing the identified concerns, particularly in the areas of material specificity, sustainability, and impact quantification, would enhance the robustness and practicality of the initiative. The proposal has the potential to significantly uplift the computational capacity of biologists, contributing positively to the field. I recommend approval with suggestions for further refinement in targeting diverse learner needs and ensuring continuous professional development.
