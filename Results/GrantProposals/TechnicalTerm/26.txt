### Review of Grant Proposal

**Overall Impression:**
The grant proposal presented by Dr. Ernest at Utah State University outlines a significant research project aimed at understanding regime shifts in ecosystems, particularly in the context of rodent communities in a Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem. The proposal is well-structured, addressing key scientific questions with a clear rationale supported by existing literature. The use of long-term experimental plots to assess reversibility and dynamics of regime shifts is particularly noteworthy. However, there are several elements that could be improved to enhance the proposalâ€™s clarity, methodology, and broader impact.

#### Strengths:

1. **Clear Research Goals**: The proposal articulates four focused research questions that are fundamental to understanding ecosystem dynamics. The aims are clearly differentiated and relevant to the broader ecological community.

2. **Use of Existing Long-Term Data**: The proposal capitalizes on a well-established long-term experiment, which adds significant value to the research. This approach allows for the integration of extensive historical data, giving the project a solid empirical foundation.

3. **Experimental Design**: The proposed experimental design involving the manipulation of rodent populations is robust, with careful consideration given to the challenges of replicating natural systems. The attention to reversing manipulations provides a unique opportunity for rigorous assessment.

4. **Broader Impacts**: The plan for data publication, software development, and targeted recruitment for underrepresented groups in science reflects a commendable commitment to accessibility and inclusivity in research. 

#### Areas for Improvement:

1. **Methodological Clarity**: While the experimental design is ambitious, the methodology could use further detail, particularly regarding how "unbalanced classification" will be accounted for in the analysis of ecosystem responses. Without clear strategies to address potential biases arising from the unbalanced nature of treatment groups, the validity of outcomes may be compromised.

2. **Hypothesis Testing**: The proposal would benefit from explicitly stating how hypotheses will be tested quantitatively. While there is a mention of generalized additive modeling and mixed models, clarity on the statistical power of these analyses and how sample sizes were determined would strengthen the proposal.

3. **Integration of Findings**: The proposal outlines several critical objectives but needs to discuss how findings will be integrated across the different components of the ecosystem being studied (e.g., plants, ants, rodents). Bridging these components could yield deeper insights into ecosystem dynamics that may not be captured through isolated analyses.

4. **Implementation Timeline**: A detailed timeline for each phase of the project should be included. This would assist reviewers in evaluating the feasibility and management of the project in the proposed timeframe, particularly given the complexity of experimental conditions and long-term monitoring.

5. **Potential Limitations**: While the proposal does mention challenges related to the manipulations of drivers, it would be beneficial to include a more in-depth discussion of potential limitations or risks that could arise during the study (e.g., unforeseen environmental changes, species interactions).

#### Conclusion:

In summary, this grant proposal presents an innovative and valuable approach to studying regime shifts in ecosystems, leveraging long-term data and experimental manipulations. Enhancing the methodological details, clarifying hypothesis testing, integrating components of ecosystem response, providing a timeline, and addressing potential limitations would improve the proposal significantly. Overall, this research project has the potential to make substantial contributions to ecological theory and management practices, but addressing the aforementioned points is necessary for a successful application.
