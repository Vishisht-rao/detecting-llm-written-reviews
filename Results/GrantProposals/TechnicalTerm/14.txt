**Review of Grant Proposal: "Livestock Movements and Disease Epidemiology in the Chad Basin: Modeling Risks for Animals and Humans"**

**Overview:**
The proposal submitted by Rebecca Garabed and her team addresses a critical gap in understanding the epidemiology of Foot and Mouth Disease Virus (FMDV) within the context of livestock movements in the Chad Basin, specifically in the Far North Region of Cameroon. The interdisciplinary approach and the intent to develop dynamic, coupled models of disease spread are ambitious and necessary given the complexities of livestock mobility and disease transmission in this endemic environment.

**Intellectual Merit:**
The intellectual merit of this proposal is considerable. The authors propose to build upon existing modeling frameworks by incorporating elements of agent-based modeling (ABM), molecular modeling, and a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) paradigm tailored to the unique situation in the Far North Region. This approach recognizes the limitations of traditional models and seeks to address the dynamic nature of infectious disease transmission among mobile herds. The inclusion of molecular epidemiological aspects also enhances the depth of inquiry into the genetic variation of FMDV, which is crucial for understanding its evolutionary dynamics in response to host immunity and transmission patterns.

The proposal's clear articulation of hypotheses, especially regarding the implications of transboundary trade and the persistence of the virus in carrier animals, establishes a solid foundation for research. Additionally, the potential exploration of the perception of FMD by local pastoralists introduces a socio-epidemiological facet that is often overlooked in traditional disease modeling.

**Broader Impacts:**
The proposal lays out a well-conceived plan for broader impacts that extend beyond academic interest. The incorporation of training for local herders in data collection and veterinary practices is particularly commendable. This not only enhances local capacity but also ensures community buy-in for the project's success. The creation of a web-based database and decision-support system for veterinary and health services represents a practical outcome that could significantly improve disease surveillance and control efforts.

The emphasis on interdisciplinary training for students at both undergraduate and graduate levels points to a commitment to building future capacity in disease ecology and public health. This approach recognizes the importance of "cortical neurons" — the critical element for information processing and decision-making in both human and ecological contexts — by fostering collaborative thinking among diverse academic backgrounds.

**Research Design:**
The research design is methodologically rigorous and detailed. The proposal outlines a clear plan for data collection across various networks of livestock movement, with a comprehensive strategy to trace FMD prevalence. The integration of different data types (molecular, spatial, ethnographic, and epidemiological) across the outlined phases demonstrates a strong commitment to producing a robust and multifaceted analysis of the problem.

The preliminary work accomplished by Dr. Moritz in mapping mobility patterns and understanding local practices strengthens the proposal, ensuring that the proposed research builds on existing knowledge. Moreover, the collaboration with local veterinary services shows a practical approach that will enhance the feasibility of the research.

**Critical Considerations:**
While the proposal is strong overall, there are areas where clearer articulation could improve the application. For example, the implications of genetic drift mentioned in hypotheses could benefit from more explicit connections to potential interventions. Furthermore, while the figures and charts support the proposal well, the inclusion of visual aids that depict the expected outcomes and applications of the models could enhance understanding further.

Additionally, a more robust discussion surrounding the ethical considerations and community involvement in the data collection process would strengthen the proposal's impact. Ensuring ethical oversight and local engagement in research endeavors will build trust and enhance the accuracy of data collected.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, this grant proposal offers a significant opportunity to advance understanding of FMD epidemiology in contextually rich ecological and social landscapes. The proposed models have the potential to inform effective disease control strategies that could serve as models for similar endemic settings worldwide. The interdisciplinary approach, combined with a strong focus on practical applications and local capacity building, positions this research as both impactful and necessary. I recommend this proposal for funding with the above considerations in mind to further enhance its potential impact.
