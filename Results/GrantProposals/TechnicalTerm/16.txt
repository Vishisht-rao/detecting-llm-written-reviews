### Grant Proposal Review

**Project Title:** Doctoral Dissertation Improvement: Fossil footprints and the dynamics of footprint formation: Implications for the evolution of human gait

**Overview:**
The grant proposal presents a compelling investigation into the evolution of bipedalism through the analysis of fossilized footprints. The research seeks to bridge gaps in our understanding of human locomotion by studying the relationship between foot anatomy, gait, and the dynamic processes involved in footprint formation. The use of experimental biomechanics to achieve this goal, coupled with the collaboration with diverse institutions and groups, adds a strong collaborative and educational component to the project.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Approach:**
   The proposal introduces innovative methodologies to study fossil footprints, particularly through the development of custom-designed pressure-sensing insoles. This approach is particularly exciting as it aims to generate quantitative data on how various anatomical and functional variables are preserved in footprints, addressing a significant gap in the literature.

2. **Comprehensive Research Framework:**
   The proposed combination of human and chimpanzee experimental studies, alongside the analysis of ancient footprints, demonstrates a well-rounded approach to understanding the evolution of bipedalism. This multidisciplinary technique offers a greater scope for testing hypotheses that have limited empirical support due to historical reliance on skeletal analysis alone.

3. **Broader Impacts:**
   The educational components of this project, particularly the training opportunities for undergraduates from Kenya, South Africa, and the US, are commendable. The focus on recruiting underrepresented groups in biological anthropology enhances the inclusiveness and societal relevance of the research efforts.

4. **Public Outreach:**
   The commitment to public engagement through collaborations with the Smithsonian Institutionâ€™s National Museum of Natural History is excellent. This outreach ensures that the scientific findings will reach a broader audience, thus enhancing public understanding of human evolution.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity of Hypotheses:**
   While the project aims to address complex evolutionary debates with operational hypotheses, the breadth of these hypotheses could pose challenges in terms of managing experimental controls and ensuring clear interpretation of varied results. The proposal may benefit from a more focused set of specific, measurable hypotheses to maintain clarity and feasibility.

2. **Technological Reliability:**
   The reliance on new technologies, such as the pressure-sensing insoles, introduces an element of unpredictability. The proposal should include a discussion of potential technical challenges or limitations associated with these tools and how the research team plans to mitigate these risks.

3. **Statistical Approaches:**
   The proposal mentions the use of multiple regression analyses and geometric morphometric methods. However, there is limited elaboration on the statistical frameworks that will be employed to analyze the diverse types of data gathered from different experimental conditions. A clearer description of the statistical tools and protocols would improve the proposal.

4. **Diverse Sediment Conditions:**
   There is acknowledgment of varying sediment properties and their influence on footprint formation. However, the proposal lacks a detailed plan for controlling or accounting for these variables across experiments to ensure the reliability of the comparative analyses with fossil footprints.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this doctoral dissertation project represents a significant contribution to the field of paleoanthropology with its innovative methodologies and collaborative approach. The research has the potential to yield important insights into the evolution of bipedalism and the mechanics of locomotion in early hominins. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in hypothesis management and methodological transparency, the proposed study is likely to advance our understanding of human evolution. The proposal adequately addresses intellectual merit and broader impacts, meriting strong support from the funding agency. 

In summary, this project presents an important opportunity to enrich the discourse around human bipedalism, though attention should be paid to maintaining rigorous scientific standards amidst the complexity of the variables involved. Additionally, the proposal should explore the implications of "kurtosis" in the statistical analysis of footprint morphology, ensuring that all data variances are accurately interpreted to inform conclusions drawn from this interdisciplinary study.
