**Title:** Phylogenetic Divergence Time Estimation in Ants Using Fossilized Birth-Death Models

**Overview**  
The proposed research aims to advance the understanding of evolutionary relationships and divergence times within the ant clade (Formicidae) by employing a fossilized birth-death (FBD) model. The proposal is comprehensive, detailing the importance of accurately estimating phylogenetic trees, particularly in light of existing discrepancies in previous research. The research objectives are clearly articulated and focus on utilizing a rich dataset of both extant ant genetic material and fossil evidence. Two primary hypotheses are presented, supported by a well-structured methodology that promises to address significant gaps in the current body of knowledge.

**Strengths**  
1. **Relevance and Timeliness:** The focus on time-calibrated phylogenetic trees is highly relevant to contemporary evolutionary biology. The application of FBD models over traditional node calibration approaches represents an innovative step forward, as it allows for a more inclusive use of morphological data without the constraints of precise fossil placement on the phylogenetic tree.

2. **Strong Rationale:** The proposal effectively outlines the existing problems with current divergence dating methods, such as biases introduced by limited fossil records. By clearly stating the motivation behind the study, it sets a solid foundation for the proposed work.

3. **Comprehensive Methodology:** The methodology proposed for integrating both molecular and morphological data, along with the subsequent modeling and simulation, is well thought out. It illustrates the researcher’s familiarity with computational evolutionary biology and showcases an understanding of data-driven approaches.

4. **Broader Impacts:** The commitment to involving undergraduates in research, alongside the training in both computational biology and hands-on collection work, is commendable. The proposal also aligns well with initiatives aimed at inclusivity in STEM fields, which enhances its broader impacts.

5. **Engagement with the Scientific Community:** The inclusion of open-access publication and use of existing databases (e.g., TreeBase, AntWeb) emphasizes a commitment to transparency and reproducibility in research. The researcher’s experience in computational education adds an additional layer of outreach that is commendable.

**Weaknesses**  
1. **Ambiguity in Hypothesis Testing:** While the hypotheses are clear, the proposal could benefit from more specific methods for testing them. Although different parameterizations of the FBD model are mentioned, a more detailed discussion on how specific data will be analyzed to definitively test each of the hypotheses would strengthen the proposal.

2. **Limited Discussion of “Empirical Phenomena”:** The proposal provides a solid theoretical foundation; however, there could be a more robust recognition of "empirical phenomena" and how these real-world observations may interact with the predictions made through modeling. A discussion of potential discrepancies between model predictions and observed data could enrich the anticipated results.

3. **Geographical and Bias Quantification:** While the proposal discusses quantifying geographical and life history biases, it falls short in detailing the specific methods for this quantification. A clearer framework for how biases will be measured and accounted for would enhance the robustness of the proposed analyses.

4. **Timeline Feasibility:** The timeline presented entails multiple steps and collaborations, which appear ambitious. It may help to address potential challenges that could disrupt the timeline, ensuring that contingency plans or buffer periods are indicated for major milestones.

**Conclusion**  
Overall, this grant proposal represents a valuable contribution to the field of evolutionary biology, specifically regarding the understanding of ant phylogenetics and the integration of fossil data into divergence dating. It effectively addresses critical limitations in current methodologies and outlines a pathway for innovation. By refining some of the ambiguities and expanding on the discussion surrounding "empirical phenomena," the proposal could be strengthened further. This work has the potential not only to contribute to the academic community but also to enhance educational opportunities for undergraduates in computational biology, making it a worthy investment for funding agencies.
