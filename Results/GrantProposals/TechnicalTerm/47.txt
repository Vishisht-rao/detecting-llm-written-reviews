**Review of Grant Proposal: Understanding Multimodality in Animal Size Distributions**

**Overview**  
The proposal outlines a comprehensive and well-structured approach to investigate the complex relationships between the individual size distribution (ISD) and species size distribution (SSD) in avian and mammalian communities. This research aims to contribute significant insights to the field of ecology, particularly regarding the processes that structure ecological communities and the multimodal nature of size distributions. The integration of macroecological and statistical modeling approaches is innovative, and there is potential for the findings to yield important theoretical and practical implications.

**Strengths**  
1. **Clear Objectives**: The proposal articulates three clear and distinct objectives, focusing on the exploration of multimodality in SSDs, the relationship between SSDs and ISDs, and modeling approaches to understand these distributions. This structured approach allows for a thorough investigation into each component of the research.

2. **Preliminary Results**: The inclusion of preliminary results showcasing evidence of multimodality in the ISD of bird communities lends credibility to the proposed research. The rigorous analysis and use of Gaussian mixture models add robustness to the findings and justify the need for further mechanistic exploration of these distributions.

3. **Comprehensive Database Development**: The plan to compile a vast database of terrestrial SSDs and utilize existing literature and coordinated sampling efforts demonstrates a strong foundation for the research. The proposed sample size (>3000 communities) is impressive and will likely provide a rich dataset for analysis.

4. **Collaboration and Expertise**: Engaging experienced collaborators, such as Drs. Morgan Ernest and Allen Hurlbert, who offer additional expertise in mammalian and avian ecology, respectively, strengthens the proposal. This interdisciplinary approach is likely to enhance the research design and execution.

5. **Broader Impacts**: The proposal includes specific plans for training a post-doctoral researcher and graduate students, which is commendable in fostering future generations of ecologists. The use of Web 2.0 tools to facilitate collaboration is also innovative and reflects an understanding of modern collaborative research needs.

**Areas for Improvement**  
1. **Expansion on Methodology**: While the proposal outlines the general methodologies to be employed, it could benefit from a more detailed description of how specific analyses will be conducted, particularly in the modeling aspect of the research. Clarifying the type of statistical models and identifying software or tools to be used would strengthen the proposal.

2. **Theoretical Framework**: The proposal could provide a more in-depth discussion on the theoretical implications of the expected findings, particularly concerning how they will advance current ecological theories regarding size distribution and community structuring processes.

3. **Addressing "Distribution Shifts"**: The proposal can further explore how potential "distribution shifts" in body sizes related to environmental changes or anthropogenic influences might impact the observed size distributions. Integrating these aspects could enhance the relevance and applicability of the research findings.

4. **Contingency Plans**: It may be prudent to include contingency plans to address potential challenges in data acquisition or modeling. For instance, what steps will be taken if certain datasets are incomplete or if preliminary results for SSD do not yield the expected outcomes?

**Conclusion**  
Overall, this grant proposal presents a robust and timely investigation into the multimodal aspects of size distributions in ecological communities. The proposed objectives are ambitious yet achievable, and the preliminary results support the need for this research. By addressing the outlined areas for improvement, particularly regarding methodological details and broader ecological implications, the proposal could be further strengthened. I recommend this proposal for funding with the expectation that it will contribute significantly to our understanding of ecological community dynamics.
