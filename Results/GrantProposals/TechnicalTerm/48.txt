### Review of Grant Proposal: "Submesoscale-Resolving Large Eddy Simulations Using Reduced Biogeochemical Models"

#### Summary:
The proposal outlines a project aimed at improving the understanding of biogeochemical tracer properties, evolution, and patchiness in the upper ocean through the development and application of reduced biogeochemical models within large-eddy simulations (LES). The interdisciplinary approach involves collaborating with experts in numerical simulations, biological oceanography, and chemical model reduction, intending to leverage advanced computational techniques to overcome the challenges posed by existing models.

#### Intellectual Merit:
The intellectual merit of the proposed study is strong. The integration of complex biogeochemical models with high-fidelity LES to study small-scale turbulence and its effects on biogeochemistry represents a significant advancement in oceanographic modeling. By utilizing techniques from combustion modeling, such as those involving "variational inference" for model reduction, the research aims to make previously challenging simulations more feasible. Moreover, the emphasis on characterizing the interactions between submesoscale turbulence and biogeochemical tracers, particularly the role of small-scale turbulent mixing on the oceanic carbon cycle, underscores the potential for this research to inform future Earth system models and improve predictive accuracy regarding climate change impacts.

The proposal subsequent to revisions effectively addresses earlier reviewer criticisms, particularly regarding the clarity of research questions. The proposal now presents well-defined and related research questions. The establishment of objectives aimed at both computational advancements and the scientific implications of these methods enhances the overall focus and relevance of the study. The proposed use of observational data from the Drake Passage for validation adds credibility and utility to the anticipated results.

#### Broader Impacts:
The proposal adequately emphasizes broader impacts, showcasing a commitment to community engagement and educational outreach. The involvement of undergraduate and PhD students, particularly from underrepresented groups in STEM, strengthens the potential for long-term impacts on workforce development. Plans for software sharing and the open availability of biogeochemical tools developed during the project will allow wider access and collaboration within the oceanographic community.

However, the proposal could further articulate specific strategies for engaging with policymakers aimed at translating research findings into actionable climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. While the dissemination of research information through public channels, social media, and educational programs is commendable, a more structured approach to influencing policy could enhance the broader impact of the research.

#### Methodology:
The methodology proposed is ambitious and well-structured, clearly detailing the steps involved in developing reduced biogeochemical models and integrating them within LES frameworks. The approach of using advanced techniques for model reduction, such as "variational inference" methods, shows innovation and an understanding of modern computational needs.

However, the proposal could provide additional clarity on how it intends to overcome potential challenges related to the complexity of validation and the inherent variability involved in real-world observations, as well as the computational costs associated with these simulations. A more explicit consideration of expected computational challenges, alongside the proposed mitigation strategies, could further strengthen the proposal’s feasibility.

#### Conclusion:
Overall, the grant proposal presents a well-conceived and interdisciplinary approach to addressing significant scientific challenges in understanding biogeochemical tracer dynamics in the upper ocean. By enhancing the accessibility of biogeochemical models through reduced-order methods, the project has the potential to provide valuable insights into the intricacies of the ocean’s carbon cycle and contribute to improved climate-related models. The reviewers' comments have been thoughtfully addressed, and with minor adjustments to broaden the engagement strategies and explicitly define challenges, this research could yield groundbreaking findings in oceanographic science.
