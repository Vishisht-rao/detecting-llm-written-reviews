**Review of Grant Proposal: Monitoring Protocol Development for Rallidae in Southeast Australia**

**Project Summary:**
The proposal presents a focused effort to develop an effective monitoring protocol for elusive species of the avian family Rallidae in southeast Australia. The use of automated recording units (ARUs) to identify optimal survey times demonstrates innovative thinking and aligns well with modern ecological monitoring strategies. The intention to minimize false absences and optimize detection is commendable, especially for species that are notoriously difficult to study.

**Intellectual Merit:**
The proposal excels in its intellectual merit by addressing a notable gap in the current monitoring techniques applicable to Rallidae in Australasia. Drawing parallels to established practices in North America provides a solid foundation for the proposed study. The emphasis on automating the survey process not only reduces observer bias but also allows for repeated surveys in challenging terrains, thereby enhancing data reliability. Furthermore, the methodology for analyzing call rates against lunar phases is an innovative approach that could yield significant insights into species behavior and ecology.

**Broader Impacts:**
The potential broader impacts of this research are significant. The PI’s dedication to mentorship and community engagement, particularly with underprivileged communities, is a strong point. The outreach strategy, particularly the planned use of social media and blog posts to disseminate findings, reflects a modern approach to science communication. The PI’s previous experience with successful Twitter accounts demonstrates their capability in executing this outreach effectively.

**Project Description:**
The project description is comprehensive and well-structured, providing a clear overview of the intended research goals and methodologies. The proposed field experiments to examine call rates and survey plot sizes add a practical component that strengthens the research framework. The timeline is organized and realistic, allowing for necessary adjustments should challenges arise.

However, the proposal could benefit from additional details regarding the specific statistical models and software (beyond Raven Software) that will be employed for data analysis. A more in-depth explanation of how Bayesian statistics will be implemented would clarify the analytical process for reviewers unfamiliar with these methods.

**Data Management Plan:**
The data management plan is robust, with provisions for long-term storage and public access. Utilizing platforms like Dropbox for data backup is prudent. However, the mention of using GitHub for archiving presence records could be underscored by detailing how data on GitHub will be maintained and made accessible to other researchers, thus enhancing transparency and collaborative opportunities.

**Concerns and Suggestions:**
1. **Lack of Detailed Budget Explanation:** The budget justification lacks specificity regarding the allocation of funds and the expected costs associated with personnel, materials, and any potential contingencies. A clear financial plan is essential for reviewers to assess the feasibility of the project.

2. **"Shortcut" to Research Success:** While innovative approaches are highlighted, it could be helpful if the proposal addressed potential challenges and limitations of using ARUs as a "shortcut" to traditional field surveys. Discussing how these limitations will be mitigated will further enhance the project’s transparency and credibility.

3. **Collaboration with Local Authorities:** Given that the study will take place in Southeast Australia, outreach to local environmental agencies or indigenous groups involved in wetland management could enhance the proposal’s context and applicability. Such collaboration might offer invaluable insights and facilitate smoother execution on-ground.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this grant proposal demonstrates a promising initiative that addresses a significant research gap in the monitoring of Rallidae species in Australasia. The thoughtful integration of technology in ecological research, along with the potential for substantial societal impacts, makes this project worthy of support. Clarifying some budgetary points and enhancing discussions around data management will further strengthen the proposal.
