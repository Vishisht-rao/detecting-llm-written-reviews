**Review of Grant Proposal: Development of a Joint Species Distribution Model (JSDM) to Predict Multi-Taxa Assemblages of Birds and Butterflies**

**Introduction:**
This grant proposal effectively addresses a critical gap in current biodiversity modeling and conservation prioritization methodologies by proposing the development of a Joint Species Distribution Model (JSDM) that predicts multi-taxa communities, specifically focusing on birds and butterflies. The rationale behind utilizing survey data over static range maps is compelling, as it emphasizes the need for dynamic and fine-scale data to inform conservation efforts that are increasingly urgent in a changing global landscape.

The proposal is well-structured, with a clear identification of the problem, the limitations of existing methods, and an innovative approach that leverages recent advancements in latent variable modeling. It presents a thorough understanding of ecological and methodological challenges, indicating a strong foundational knowledge in both conservation biology and statistical modeling.

**Research Plan:**
The research plan is logically divided into three phased stages: data preparation, model development, and model evaluation. This structured approach is beneficial for ensuring that the results are robust and scientifically valid. The choice to utilize existing large-scale datasets like the North American Breeding Bird Survey and the North American Butterfly Count is commendable as it maximizes the use of high-quality data.

One aspect that could be further articulated is the specific statistical criteria and methods that will be employed to determine the model's predictive ability and selection. While cross-validation is mentioned as a strategy to assess prediction accuracy, details surrounding metrics such as AUC (Area Under Curve), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), or others would strengthen the proposal, providing a more explicit understanding of how success will be quantified.

Additionally, the plan to validate the model against simulated assemblages in various ecological scenarios is excellent. This could enhance understanding of the ecological mechanisms driving the relationships between the taxa and inform subsequent modeling efforts.

**Intellectual Merit:**
The proposal claims to pioneer the use of JSDMs in predicting multi-taxa assemblages—an assertion that could significantly advance conservation methodologies if successful. The exploration of "explicit regularizer" methodologies to navigate the challenges of ecological data and model complexity may further enhance the robustness of the predictions. Nevertheless, the proposal could benefit from referencing existing frameworks or recent studies that explore the trade-offs in model complexities when incorporating "explicit regularizer" approaches.

The discussion on the implications of prediction failures in understanding underlying ecological processes is insightful and demonstrates a forward-thinking attitude critical for scientific advancement.

**Broader Impacts:**
The anticipated outcomes of this project promise to have significant direct applications in conservation policy and decision-making. The integration of educational initiatives targeting undergraduate students and middle school girls exemplifies a commitment to fostering diversity in the sciences, which is particularly commendable.

Furthermore, the proposal’s commitment to making results publicly available via the ROpenSci project ensures a broad dissemination of knowledge, which aligns with contemporary best practices in science communication and community engagement.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this grant proposal makes a strong case for the proposed research. It is methodologically sound, addresses significant gaps in current biodiversity conservation efforts, and has the potential for considerable impact on the field. I recommend that the applicant consider further elaboration on the selection criteria for model evaluation, and the incorporation of "explicit regularizer" techniques to enhance the predictive model. With these refinements, this work could represent a groundbreaking advancement in our understanding and management of biodiversity.
