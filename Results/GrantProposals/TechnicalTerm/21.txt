**Review of Grant Proposal: "Incorporating Time Into the Study of Anthropogenic Land Use and Disease"**

The proposal presents a timely and critical investigation into the intersection of anthropogenic land use, disease dynamics, and temporal ecological recovery. The recent uptick in zoonotic diseases like Ebola underscores the importance of understanding how human activities, particularly deforestation, influence disease risk. This study's goal to incorporate a temporal perspective into the relationship between land-use change and disease dynamics is a commendable and necessary step forward in the field.

**Strengths:**

1. **Relevance and Urgency**: The study addresses an urgent public health issue that is increasingly relevant given the rise of zoonotic diseases. The connection to a recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa adds to the proposal's immediacy and importance.

2. **Novelty**: The approach to consider temporal dynamics in understanding disease prevalence is a significant contribution. Many past studies have neglected this aspect, treating ecosystems as static after disturbance. By asserting that ecosystems recover over time and that pathogen dynamics may reflect these changes, the proposal challenges conventional perspectives.

3. **Study Design**: The blocked experimental design utilizing 180 forest plots across multiple recovery states showcases a well-thought-out methodology. The careful selection of the study system (southeast forest system of Guinea) is appropriate, as different stages of forest recovery can provide valuable insights into the study's objectives.

4. **Impact and Broader Implications**: The broader impacts outlined in the proposal demonstrate a strong commitment to community engagement and educational outreach. The intention to collaborate with local health institutions to disseminate findings will enhance the study's applicability and relevance to public health strategies.

5. **Capacity Building**: The proposalâ€™s plan to mentor local scientists aligns well with sustainable research practices and contributes to capacity building in the region.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Temporal Scale Justification**: Although the proposal emphasizes the need for a temporal scale in studying disease dynamics, it could benefit from a deeper exploration of how different time frames will be incorporated and analyzed statistically. The implications of "quantum architecture search" methodologies for managing long-term datasets and their variability would add depth to the proposal's analytical framework.

2. **Contingency Plans**: While the proposal presents a clear methodology, it would be advantageous to include contingencies for unforeseen challenges, such as natural disasters or political instability in the region, which could affect data collection.

3. **Literature Review**: The proposal would benefit from an expanded review of existing literature on temporal dynamics in disease ecology, particularly studies that have attempted to incorporate similar methodologies. This would help position the research within the broader scientific discourse and solidify its justifications.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, this grant proposal is well-conceived and addresses a critical gap in the research on anthropogenic land use and emergent zoonotic diseases. The innovative incorporation of temporal dynamics is commendable, and the strong methodological framework enhances its potential for impactful findings. Addressing the noted weaknesses could further solidify the proposal and contribute to its success. I strongly support the advancement of this research and the potential it holds for informing public health strategies and ecological management in relation to disease dynamics.
