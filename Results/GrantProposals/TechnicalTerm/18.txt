**Review of Grant Proposal: Taxonomic Efficacy of the Macaque Skeleton**

**Overall Impression:**
The proposal submitted by Brittany Kenyon-Flatt for the Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant aims to investigate the taxonomic efficacy of skeletal morphology in macaques, specifically examining how climate, geography, and behavior affect taxonomic assessments within the genus *Macaca*. The proposal is well-structured, with a clearly articulated project summary, intellectual merits, broader impacts, and research plan. The use of geometric morphometric (GM) analysis to study skeletal morphology offers an innovative approach, and the potential to contribute significant findings to biological anthropology, paleobiology, and systematics is promising.

**Intellectual Merits:**
1. **Research Questions and Hypotheses:**
   - The central research question of whether different macaque species are taxonomically distinguishable based on skeletal morphology is relevant and timely.
   - The formulation of hypotheses (H1 to H5) is logical, and the research design connects well to previous studies. It seeks to expand existing knowledge on intra-generic variance, which is crucial for understanding evolutionary processes and has implications for paleoanthropological interpretation.
   - The pilot study results are promising, highlighting unexpected findings that the os coxa may serve as a better taxonomic indicator than the cranium, challenging conventional wisdom in the field.

2. **Methodology:**
   - The proposed methodologies, including 3D geometric morphometric analysis and traditional metric analysis of long bones, are suitable and well-supported by previous literature.
   - The plan to create a comprehensive dataset combining cranial and post-cranial morphologies is commendable. This endeavor could enhance future comparative studies across various primate species, including extinct hominins.

3. **Data Collection and Analysis Techniques:**
   - The approach to utilizing both landmarking for around structural analysis and traditional metric measurements allows for a multifaceted understanding of skeletal differences.
   - The mention of robust statistical methods, such as MANOVA and canonical variate analysis (CVA), strengthens the credibility of the proposed research.

**Broader Impacts:**
1. **Outreach and Education:**
   - The planned workshops targeting underrepresented groups in K-12 education are commendable and align well with broader impacts expected from NSF funding. The focus on conveying scientific information about skeletal adaptations to environmental changes is particularly relevant in engaging students.
   - The connections made to the New York State Common Core Curriculum are crucial for demonstrating the broader relevance of the project, enhancing educational opportunities in science for young students.

2. **Public Engagement:**
   - Efforts to disseminate findings through blogs aimed at popular science audiences will foster greater public engagement with the research.
   - Presentations to university groups such as WISE and opportunities for undergraduate involvement will further enhance the educational impact of this project.

3. **Contributions to Collections and Future Research:**
   - The establishment of a unique digital dataset is a vital contribution that strengthens the projectâ€™s significance in both maintaining and enhancing existing biological collections, especially in light of recent global events that have endangered historical specimens (e.g., the fire in Brazil's National Museum).
   - The potential for the research to assist museum curators in identifying mislabeled specimens adds considerable practical value to the academic contribution.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
1. **Pilot Study Clarification:**
   - While the pilot study's results are encouraged for inclusion, a direct discussion on how it influenced the chosen methodologies and hypotheses in this proposal could further contextualize the research approach.
   - The proposal would benefit from elaborating on landmark selection criteria beyond those mentioned, particularly in exploring its implications for the proposed research.

2. **Tool Making Reference:**
   - Given the focus on morphological adaptations, a brief discussion on "tool making" behaviors in conjunction with skeletal morphology would present an interesting angle that aligns behavior with the evolutionary significance of the anatomy explored.

3. **Further Detailing Outcomes:**
   - Clear objectives and timelines in deliverables sections would enhance the reader's understanding of how the project will unfold over its duration and clarify milestones for successful completion.

**Conclusion:**
This grant proposal presents a well-conceived research project that has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of skeletal morphology in macaques. The proposed methodologies are innovative, and the broader impacts are thoughtfully considered. Minor recommendations aimed at improving clarity and expanding scope can strengthen the proposal. I strongly recommend funding for this promising research endeavor.
