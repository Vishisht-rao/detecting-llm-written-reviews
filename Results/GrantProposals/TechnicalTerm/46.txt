**Review of Grant Proposal: "Quantifying Ecosystem Services Provided by Stormwater Wet Ponds"**

**Project Summary:**
The proposal presents a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to understanding the socio-environmental dynamics of stormwater wet ponds (SWPs). It seeks to address the interactions between societal values, perceptions, and environmental processes that influence the ecosystem services provided by SWPs. The research questions are well articulated, focusing on the dichotomy between primary services (e.g., flood control, pollutant removal) and secondary services (e.g., aesthetics, property value). 

**Intellectual Merit:**
The intellectual merit of this proposal is strong. The research addresses a critical knowledge gap regarding the effectiveness of SWPs as anthropized ecosystems while emphasizing both natural and social constraints on ecosystem service provision. The hypotheses are clearly stated, and the proposed methodologies—ranging from biogeochemical assessments to social marketing interventions—are appropriate and well-integrated. The proposal outlines a "contraction lemma" approach, which may offer significant insights into the inherent trade-offs and feedbacks between societal values and biogeochemical dynamics in SWPs. This theoretical underpinning is crucial for advancing our understanding of integrated socio-ecological systems.

The research design is robust, utilizing a twofold approach focused on local community engagement and statewide analysis. The focus on both qualitative and quantitative methods enhances the project's potential to yield comprehensive insights. The proposed experiments, including discrete choice experiments and geospatial analysis, are methodologically sound and well aligned with the research objectives.

**Broader Impacts:**
The broader impacts section is particularly well-developed. The focus on education and outreach through collaborations with Cooperative Extension is a significant merit of this proposal, as it aims to bridge the gap between research findings and practical application within communities. The incorporation of educational modules for K-12 students and high school educators enhances community involvement and fosters a sense of ownership regarding local SWPs.

Moreover, the proposal shows a commitment to diversifying the research workforce through targeted recruitment efforts, particularly from underrepresented communities. This aspect is commendable and aligns with current funding agency priorities focused on broadening participation in STEM fields.

**Overall Assessment:**
While the proposal is strong overall, a few areas for improvement could be addressed:

1. **Clarification of Focal SWP Selection:** The panel suggested a need for more detailed justification regarding the selection criteria for focal SWPs. Providing a clearer rationale, including ecological and social considerations, would strengthen the proposal.

2. **Integration of Geospatial Components:** Although efforts have been made to integrate geospatial analyses with the overall project design, more specific details on how these analyses will inform and be informed by social and environmental dynamics could be elaborated.

3. **Potential for Disamenities:** The proposal mentions that SWPs may function as disamenities in certain contexts. A more thorough exploration of the socio-economic implications of this, particularly in relation to property values, would enhance the narrative.

In conclusion, this proposal represents a highly competitive application that promises to advance scholarship in understanding the socio-environmental dynamics of SWPs while also producing valuable educational and community engagement outcomes. The interdisciplinary nature of the research team and the thoughtful integration of social science methodologies with natural sciences signify a promising approach towards achieving the stated goals. Further clarifications and detail in the aforementioned areas will undoubtedly enhance the proposal's overall impact and execution.
