### Grant Proposal Review: Dynamic Macroecology

#### Overview
The proposed research project seeks to advance our understanding of biodiversity dynamics through a macroecological lens, specifically focusing on body size patterns and their response to environmental change. The author outlines an ambitious and well-structured approach to tackle three critical aspects in dynamic macroecology: data aggregation and access, mechanistic modeling of complex systems, and cross-scale analysis. The proposal demonstrates a clear intellectual merit with defined objectives and potential broader impacts through educational outreach and open-access data sharing.

#### Intellectual Merit
The emphasis on body size as a vital integrative metric of functional and trait diversity showcases the novelty of the proposed work. The author effectively articulates the hypothesis that body size patterns may respond differently to environmental perturbations compared to traditional taxonomic diversity metrics. Incorporating both statistical modeling and experimental data to achieve the research objectives is commendable and speaks to a comprehensive methodology.

However, while the proposal acknowledges that changes in body size structure may reflect significant ecological insights, it would benefit from further exposition on the mechanistic pathways by which species interactions could influence body size under global change scenarios. More detailed theoretical underpinning and empirical evidence from existing literature would strengthen the foundation of the proposal and help bolster expectations for the outcomes.

#### Broader Impacts
The broader impacts section is particularly strong, outlining plans for disseminating research findings across various audiences, including the scientific community, undergraduates, and the general public. The commitment to open-access principles, via platforms like GitHub and figshare, aligns well with the push for transparency and reproducibility in research.

Incorporating educational initiatives targeting K-12 students and promoting the role of women in STEM is commendable and indicative of a well-rounded approach to scientific outreach. This initiative is particularly timely and relevant, addressing disparities in representation in tech fields. However, the proposal could benefit from a more detailed plan for assessing the effectiveness of these outreach activities beyond just tracking social media interactions. For example, considering evaluation criteria such as pre-and post-event surveys could provide a more robust assessment of impact.

#### Methodological Rigor
The research plan outlines a solid methodology, predicting body size responses to various environmental changes through agent-based modeling and empirical data aggregation. The integration of “matrix sensing” techniques can facilitate the understanding of complex ecological interactions and enhance data interpretation, tapping into sophisticated statistical methodologies for modeling size distributions.

However, more justification of the chosen data sources is needed. While the Breeding Bird Survey and Forest Inventory Analysis data are widely recognized, additional detail on how these datasets will correlate with body size data—especially where individual sizes are estimated rather than directly measured—would clarify aspects of data reliability and validity.

The statistical techniques proposed for analyzing body size patterns are suitable, but additional discussion on anticipated challenges in handling large, multi-dimensional datasets and potential solutions would be prudent. Addressing these aspects may mitigate potential issues related to data biases or missing data.

#### Mentorship and Collaboration
The choice of mentors reflects a strong collaborative network; Brian McGill and Nicholas Gotelli offer complementary expertise in statistical modeling and experimental ecology. The strategy for using mentorship as part of the training objectives is well thought out and should positively influence the developmental trajectory of the primary investigator.

Encouraging interdisciplinary interactions across various departments will reinforce a broadened perspective, essential for tackling complex eco-evolutionary questions. Specific mechanisms for engaging with faculty across disciplines could enrich collaborative outputs and diversify methodological approaches.

#### Conclusion
Overall, the grant proposal outlines a promising research project that can contribute significantly to the understanding of macroecological dynamics in biodiversity under environmental change. The focus on body size patterns is innovative and presents opportunities for impactful findings in both conservation biology and ecological theory. Refining certain methodological aspects, enhancing discussion on broader impacts, and justifying data sources will strengthen the proposal considerably. I recommend funding this proposal with provisions for addressing the noted recommendations.
