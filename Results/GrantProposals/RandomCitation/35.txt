**Review of Grant Proposal: Time-Scaling Phylogenetic Trees Using Fossilized Birth-Death Models in Ants**

**Overview:**
This grant proposal presents a compelling project aimed at advancing the field of evolutionary biology by improving the methods of estimating divergence times in phylogenetic trees through the integration of fossil and molecular data. The focus on ants as a model system is particularly well-justified given the extensive genetic data available as well as the rich fossil record. The proposal is clear in outlining both the significance of the research and its methodological framework.

**Intellectual Merit:**
The intellectual merit of the project is robust. The author presents two well-defined hypotheses regarding the benefits of integrating morphological data and the challenges posed by geographical and life history biases in divergence time estimation. The proposal highlights the advantages of the fossilized birth-death (FBD) model over traditional node calibration methods, specifically in relation to using a more comprehensive fossil dataset. This approach is timely and addresses gaps in the current literature, notably the lack of best practices for using FBD methods in phylogenetic analyses (Stetson et al., 2023).

The project's objective to generate a well-resolved ant phylogenetic tree is ambitious yet achievable, and the proposed use of simulation to explore geographical and biological biases in fossil preservation is a valuable addition to the current understanding of the limitations of divergence time estimation. The authorâ€™s previous experience with computational biology and phylogenetic modeling positions them well for carrying out this research.

**Broader Impacts:**
The broader impacts of the proposal are thoughtfully considered. The project will directly involve undergraduates in hands-on research, fostering interest and skills in evolutionary biology and computational methods. The proposed engagement with public educational programs at the Field Museum demonstrates a commitment to outreach and education. Furthermore, the collaboration with experienced mentors, including Dr. Heath and Dr. Moreau, enhances the potential for success and enriches the training and professional development aspects of the project.

**Methodology:**
The methodology outlined in the proposal is methodical and well-structured. The initial focus on assembling an extensive dataset from available genomic and fossil records establishes a solid foundation for the research. The plan to utilize BLAST for validating sequence authenticity is prudent, and the integration of FBD models with Bayesian analysis stands out as an innovative contribution that promises to improve the accuracy of divergence time estimations.

However, while the proposal is thorough, there are a few areas where further clarification would be beneficial. For example, the author discusses different parameterizations of the FBD model but could provide more detail on how they will select among these during the modeling process. Additionally, while the proposal mentions the anticipated difficulties with misidentified sequences, discussing how these potential issues will be mitigated would strengthen the methodology.

**Training Objectives:**
The training objectives are well-articulated, and the proposal effectively outlines how the proposed work will expand the author's current skill set while providing opportunities for student involvement. This emphasis on mentoring and training aligns well with broader educational goals, particularly in integrating underrepresented groups into scientific research.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this grant proposal demonstrates a high level of preparation, thoughtfulness in design, and a commitment to scientific advancement in evolutionary biology. The interdisciplinary approach, blending empirical research with theoretical modeling, along with a strong focus on training and community engagement, make this proposal a valuable candidate for funding. I recommend support for this project, as it promises to yield significant insights into phylogenetic methods and contribute meaningfully to our understanding of ant evolution.

**Recommendation:** 
Strongly recommend funding.
