**Grant Proposal Review**

**Title**: The effects of loss of function mutations over adaptive trajectories in *S. cerevisiae*

**Overview**:
This proposal presents a compelling approach to understanding the dynamics of adaptive evolution in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* by investigating the influence of loss of function (LOF) mutations on overall population fitness across varying genetic backgrounds. The study seeks to bridge a critical gap in our knowledge of how deleterious mutations impact evolutionary trajectories in a model organism, contributing valuable insights to the fields of genetics and evolutionary biology.

**Intellectual Merit**: **Excellent**

**Strengths**:
The proposed research is rooted in robust theoretical frameworks and aims to empirically test critical hypotheses surrounding fitness landscapes. The applicant outlines a well-structured approach, utilizing cutting-edge techniques such as transposon mutagenesis and massively parallel sequencing (Tn-seq) to measure fitness effects of LOF mutations. The intent to create a "frozen fossil record" of evolving populations is innovative and will allow for unique insights into evolutionary dynamics and adaptation. The hypotheses cover both the global epistasis model and Fisher's geometric model—both foundational concepts in evolutionary biology—thereby ensuring that the project addresses significant theoretical questions.

Moreover, the researcher's background strongly supports this ambitious endeavor. The applicant's prior experiences in evolutionary biology and genetic studies, combined with letters of support from reputable microbiologists and ecologists, bolster confidence in their capability to execute the proposed work effectively.

**Weaknesses**:
While there are no major weaknesses identified regarding the research strategy or the applicant's qualifications, it is worth noting that the significance of the expected outcomes could be articulated more explicitly. Particularly, how findings could inform broader areas like cancer evolution or pathogen adaptation could strengthen the intellectual merit further.

**Broader Impacts**: **Very Good**

**Strengths**:
The applicant has a commendable track record in scientific communication, including internships at National Geographic and initiatives to promote science education through video and digital media. This breadth of experience suggests a high potential to engage diverse audiences effectively. The project is positioned to have significant implications, not just for evolutionary biology but also for relevant real-world applications in health and disease progression, addressing broader societal issues.

**Weaknesses**:
While the proposal includes several worthwhile outreach experiences, it would benefit from a more focused discussion on how the applicant plans to reach underrepresented communities in STEM fields. Additionally, certain sections dedicated to less impactful experiences, such as the informal science symposium, could be condensed to provide more space for elaboration on future outreach objectives and strategies, particularly targeting diverse audiences.

**Summary Comments**:
Overall, this proposal showcases an excellent research project that is original, timely, and methodologically sound. The applicant clearly demonstrates the necessary background and skillset to execute their project successfully. While the broader impacts presentation is strong, providing concrete plans for reaching underrepresented groups in STEM would enhance the proposal's potential impact. 

This application holds both scientific promise and societal relevance, and I am particularly enthusiastic about the transformative potential of the research outlined. I conclude that the proposed work, if funded, could significantly enhance our understanding of evolutionary processes in a model organism. Additionally, findings may contribute to broader applications in understanding the evolution of asexual populations, such as pathogens and cancer cells, which is critical given the contexts of contemporary global health challenges.
