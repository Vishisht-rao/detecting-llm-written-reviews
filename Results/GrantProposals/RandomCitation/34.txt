**Review of Grant Proposal: "Diversity-stability relationships and coexistence: new theory and empirical tests"**

**Intellectual Merit:**
The proposal addresses a significant question in ecology: the relationship between community biodiversity and temporal stability of community biomass. The work builds on an extensive body of literature and aims to unify two key research areas – diversity-stability relationships and species coexistence mechanisms. The proposed methodology combining statistical and population models with mechanistic modeling is robust and innovative. The intention to analyze long-term datasets across diverse ecosystems will likely yield valuable insights into the demographic processes influencing stability. The proposed work to bridge the gap between coexistence and stability theories (as illustrated in equations and theoretical frameworks) is particularly compelling. However, the proposal could benefit from expanding upon how the results will advance both ecological theory and practical conservation efforts.

**Broader Impacts:**
The plan to disseminate findings through leading ecology journals and provide open-access computer code on GitHub effectively addresses the transparency and reproducibility of science, enhancing the project's broader impact. Additionally, the creation of “Whiteboard Ecology” videos represents a creative way to educate and engage both scientists and students, promoting a deeper understanding of ecological theories and their mathematical representations. However, further elaboration on how these educational resources will reach and be utilized by those outside of academia—for example, policy-makers or conservation practitioners—could strengthen this section.

**Research Methods:**
The methodological framework is detailed and well-structured, with a clear outline of how different ecological factors will be quantified using Integral Projection Models (IPMs). The proposal aptly highlights the importance of employing Bayesian methods to capture individual-level variation, which is a considerable advancement over previous works. However, it would be beneficial to discuss potential challenges in model assumptions or data limitations that could arise and how these will be addressed in the analysis.

**Mentorship and Collaboration:**
The selection of mentors, particularly with Dr. Peter Adler's expertise in ecology and Dr. Fred Adler's in mathematics, appears well thought out. Their combined backgrounds suggest a strong support system for the applicant, promoting the development of critical quantitative skills necessary for modern ecological research. However, elaboration on how interactions with postdocs and students in Dr. Adler's lab will foster collaborative learning and development could enhance the proposal's strength.

**Training Objectives and Career Development:**
The proposed training objectives demonstrate a commitment to developing quantitative skills and pedagogy for future ecological education. The outlined teaching plan is particularly innovative and aligns well with current trends in biology education, emphasizing the importance of coding and data analysis. It would be advantageous to include more specific methods of assessment to evaluate student learning outcomes in order to support the effectiveness of this approach.

**Overall Evaluation:**
In summary, this grant proposal is well-structured, presents significant intellectual merit, and outlines valuable broader impacts through educational outreach. The integration of ecological theory, statistical modeling, and community engagement presents a compelling case for funding. Minor revisions could enhance clarity and provide additional depth in several areas, particularly regarding the impact on policy and practical conservation applications, as well as training outcomes. Overall, this proposal has the potential to make a meaningful contribution to both ecological science and education.

**Citation Note:** It is worth mentioning that while the work is situated within existing literature, it could be further benefitted by citing recent findings, such as those by Mullin et al. (2021), which address emerging frameworks in biodiversity research. 

**Recommendation:** Fund with minor revisions.
