**Review of Grant Proposal: "Computer Science meets Anthropology: a novel approach for reconstructing locomotion from fossil human footprints"**

**Overall Evaluation:**

This grant proposal presents an innovative and interdisciplinary approach to understanding human bipedalism through the integration of experimental biomechanics, robotic vision, and machine learning techniques. The proposed study aims to leverage advancements from computer science to provide new insights into the evolutionary history of human locomotion based on fossil human footprints. The proposal is well-structured, clearly articulating its intellectual merit and broader impacts. It has the potential to make significant contributions to both paleoanthropology and computational methods in the sciences.

**Intellectual Merit:**

The intellectual merit of the project is strong. The proposal addresses a long-standing question in anthropology regarding the complexity and variations of bipedal locomotion among extinct species. The use of fossil footprints as a direct source of locomotor behavior is a compelling aspect of the research, providing a unique opportunity to capture the biomechanical details that skeletal morphology alone cannot reveal.

The integration of cutting-edge technologies such as X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM) and real-time 3-D motion capture systems in experimental design demonstrates innovation and creativity. The project is well-positioned to produce quantitative analyses that refine our understanding of ancient locomotion and potentially challenge existing theories about the evolution of bipedalism. Moreover, the anticipated development of machine learning algorithms tailored to identify and reconstruct locomotor patterns from footprint morphology represents a novel application that could open new avenues of research. 

**Broader Impacts:**

The broader impacts of the proposed research are also promising. The engagement with the Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program for public dissemination indicates a strong commitment to outreach and education. Presenting research findings through lectures and interactive programs not only enhances public understanding of human evolution but also encourages participation from diverse audiences.

Furthermore, the plan to recruit and mentor undergraduate students, particularly those from historically underrepresented groups in STEM through the Trachtenberg Scholars Program, is commendable. This initiative aligns with the NSF's goals to promote inclusivity and engagement in science and will help foster the next generation of researchers in both anthropology and computational sciences.

**Methodological Rigor:**

The proposed methodology is thorough and well-explained, with clear details on the experimental design for both subsurface and above-surface visualization. The hypotheses outlined for testing are scientifically sound and represent a logical progression in understanding the interaction between locomotor behavior and substrate deformation. 

However, it would benefit the proposal to expand on the potential limitations or challenges associated with the methodologies employed, particularly regarding the use of XROMM and the reliance on machine learning algorithms, which can sometimes yield biased results if not trained appropriately. Discussing contingencies or alternative strategies could strengthen the proposal by anticipating possible obstacles.

**Citations and Literature Review:**

The literature review is comprehensive, indicating a thorough grounding in existing research. The proposal effectively articulates how the work will fill gaps in the current understanding of bipedalism. However, there is a lack of engagement with the latest findings which might be relevant, such as the recent study by Esposito et al. (2023), which addresses locomotor biomechanics in a novel context. Including relevant recent studies could enhance the review's thoroughness and showcase how this research fits within the wider body of knowledge.

**Conclusion:**

In summary, this proposal is a commendable effort to bridge the disciplines of anthropology and computer science. Its innovative approach to analyzing fossil footprints offers the potential for groundbreaking insights into human evolution. The research objectives are ambitious but grounded in solid methodology and interdisciplinary collaboration. By refining a few aspects regarding potential methodological limitations and enhancing the literature review, this proposal can significantly advance our understanding of human bipedalism. 

**Recommendation:**
I recommend this proposal for funding with the suggestions provided for improvement. It is expected that the outcomes of this project will contribute valuable knowledge to the fields of anthropology, biomechanics, and machine learning, potentially leading to new collaborative efforts across these areas.
