**Grant Proposal Review**

**Summary**: The proposal outlines the journey of a graduate student who has transitioned from personal struggles with identity and community in college to a passionate focus on ecological and evolutionary research. Through a series of research experiences, mentorship opportunities, and a clear commitment to outreach and diversity, the candidate demonstrates a strong potential for contributing to the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. The proposal effectively highlights both intellectual merit and broader impacts, making a compelling case for support.

**Intellectual Merit**: The applicant's academic trajectory is impressive, demonstrating a solid combination of research experience and a growing skill set in genetics and computational biology. The breadth of research presented—from studying the population genetics of the Dakota skipper butterfly to sequencing genetic material from leech guts—underscores a deep engagement with biodiversity and conservation. The proposal points to a well-defined academic evolution, where the candidate’s personal experiences have informed their research interests, paralleling the journey from introspection to inquiry. The mention of collaboration with prominent researchers and ongoing projects adds significant credibility. Importantly, the candidate has produced two publications and several manuscripts in preparation, showcasing productivity in research. The proposal cites "Escalante et al. (2019)" which adds depth to the contextual background but could benefit from more specific discussion of how the methodologies or findings from this citation directly relate to the applicant’s work.

**Broader Impacts**: The candidate's commitment to outreach and education is commendable. Their efforts to apply research findings to real-world conservation practices, such as those at the Minnesota Zoo, demonstrate a proactive approach to ensuring that research translates into tangible outcomes. Mentoring undergraduates in research and taking leadership roles within graduate student organizations reflects a strong dedication to fostering a collaborative academic environment. The initiative taken in improving departmental diversity in seminar series is particularly noteworthy; the proposal provides a clear example of how the candidate is actively working to create more equitable spaces in academia. 

**Diversity, Equity & Inclusion**: The proposal articulately addresses the need for diversity in the sciences, drawing from personal experiences to motivate their efforts. The candidate’s involvement in their department's DEI initiatives is substantive, providing examples of concrete actions taken to promote inclusivity. By recognizing the need for representation and implementing measures to enhance diversity in speaker nominations, they illustrate a thoughtful and effective strategy for change.

**Future Goals**: The intention to pursue a career as a museum scientist combined with university faculty responsibilities aligns well with the applicant's demonstrated interests and skills. The goals outlined resonate meaningfully with their past experiences and current research, and the focus on mentoring and public engagement highlights a commitment to building community within the scientific sphere. 

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
1. Greater specificity in linking previous research cited (e.g., “Escalante et al. (2019)”) to the candidate’s current questions and methodologies could enhance the proposal's academic context.
2. Consider providing more detail on how the computational skills gained will specifically enhance the applicant's research goals, beyond the initial mention of tools like R and Python.
3. While the candidate emphasizes their desire to increase equity in science, offering more specific strategies or frameworks for achieving this in their future work would strengthen their position further.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the grant proposal provides a thorough overview of the candidate's academic journey and research initiatives. By integrating personal narrative with scientific inquiry, the proposal presents a compelling case for support that balances intellectual merit with meaningful societal impact. The candidate’s trajectory showcases potential not just for personal academic excellence, but for contributing positively to the broader scientific community as well. The proposal merits strong consideration for funding, given its alignment with the goals of fostering diverse and impactful scientific research.
