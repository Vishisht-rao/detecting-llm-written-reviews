**Grant Proposal Review: EEID: Livestock Movements and Disease Epidemiology in the Chad Basin: Modeling Risks for Animals and Humans**

**Overall Impression:**
The proposal submitted by Rebecca Garabed and her team presents a comprehensive approach to studying the epidemiology of Foot and Mouth Disease Virus (FMDV) within the complex ecological and socio-economic context of the Chad Basin, specifically in the Far North Region of Cameroon. The interdisciplinary nature of the project, combining molecular, spatial, ethnographic, and epidemiological data, is a significant strength. The proposed models (SIR, ABM, and evolutionary models) offer a robust framework for understanding disease dynamics in mobile pastoral systems. The potential for broader applications of these models to other infectious disease scenarios is particularly noteworthy.

**Intellectual Merit:**
The intellectual merit of the proposal is impressive. The project effectively addresses gaps in existing epidemiological modeling by focusing on dynamic systems with extensive host movements and multiple serotypes of FMDV. The proposal identifies critical gaps in understanding how these factors influence disease transmission and persistence in endemic settings. The emphasis on integrating new data and the use of advanced modeling techniques to capture the complexities of viral evolution and host immunity over time is commendable.

However, some aspects could be further clarified. For instance, while the proposal mentions the application of evolutionary models, the specific methods for tracking viral evolution could be articulated more clearly. The integration of molecular data with epidemiological models is essential for validating hypotheses, and a more detailed description of how this will be accomplished would strengthen the proposal. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to provide insights into how findings will inform public health interventions not just locally, but also in the context of livestock trade and movement across borders.

**Broader Impacts:**
The broader impacts of the project are well-defined, particularly in advocating for regional health systems and local capacity building. The training of Cameroonian veterinary students and the involvement of local herders in data collection illustrate a commitment to community engagement, which will likely enhance the success of the projectâ€™s objectives. The creation of a web-based database for monitoring disease incidence and potential interventions is a positive initiative that can serve as a model for similar efforts in other regions.

However, discussions around the economic implications and potential benefits of FMD, as perceived by local pastoralists, warrant more attention. While the proposal suggests that FMD may be viewed positively by herders, a deeper exploration of the socio-economic factors influencing this perception could provide valuable insights. It would also be helpful to cite recent literature on this topic, such as Lau et al. (2023), which may offer fresh perspectives on pastoralists' attitudes towards disease management and livestock mobility.

**Methodology:**
The methodology is thorough and reflects a sound understanding of the complexities associated with disease transmission in pastoral systems. The use of GPS technology and the interdisciplinary approach to data collection are particularly promising. However, the proposal could benefit from a clearer timeline that outlines key milestones during the four years of data collection and analysis. Identifying specific coordination strategies between different research activities may also help streamline the process and enhance data integration.

**References and Citations:**
The references cited throughout the proposal indicate a solid foundation in both epidemiological and anthropological literature. Some references could use a more contemporary context, particularly in light of emerging research surrounding FMD and similar zoonotic diseases. Including recent studies that emphasize lessons learned from other regions facing similar diseases would provide an even stronger rationale for the proposed research.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, this proposal offers a promising and innovative approach to understanding the epidemiology of FMDV in a complex ecological and socio-economic landscape. By addressing the points raised in this review, the team can further enhance the robustness of their proposal and its potential impacts on understanding disease dynamics in mobile pastoral systems. Overall, I recommend funding this project, as its outcomes could significantly contribute to both scientific knowledge and practical disease management strategies in the Chad Basin and beyond.
