**Review of Grant Proposal: Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: Taxonomic Efficacy of the Macaque Skeleton**

**Overall Impression:**
The proposal presented by Brittany Kenyon-Flatt for a Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (DDRIG) is well-structured, focused on a critical gap in the field of biological anthropology, and demonstrates significant potential to advance our understanding of taxonomic classification within the genus Macaca based on skeletal morphology. The research seeks to address both intellectual and practical implications, making it a compelling submission for funding consideration.

**Project Summary:**
The proposal effectively outlines the objectives of the research, which aims to examine the taxonomic efficacy of skeletal elements in macaques, investigating intra-generic morphological variation and the potential confounding influences of climate, geography, and behavior. The hypotheses articulated in the summary are clear and logically connected to the projectâ€™s central research question. Furthermore, the use of 3D geometric morphometric analysis as a methodology is appropriate and innovative, leveraging modern technological advancements in morphological assessment.

**Intellectual Merits:**
The proposal has a strong intellectual foundation, grounded in a review of existing literature which highlights the historical bias towards cranial morphology in taxonomic studies. By focusing on post-cranial elements and employing geometric morphometric techniques, this research has the potential to redefine how taxonomic classifications are understood within primatology. The anticipated creation of a unique digital dataset, which includes 3D scans of skeletal elements for future research, is a significant contribution to the field.

The discussion of previous pilot study results provides a solid basis for this project, demonstrating an early commitment to empirical evidence. Specific mention of appropriate citations, such as those by Lycett and von Cramon-Taubadel, reinforces the research's scholarly context. However, the proposal could be strengthened by a more explicit discussion of how the findings will influence broader debates in paleoanthropology, particularly regarding the taxonomic assessment of extinct hominins. 

**Broader Impacts:**
The broader impacts articulated in the proposal are commendable. The intention to engage underrepresented groups through workshops is particularly noteworthy, as it demonstrates a commitment to inclusivity in science education. The proposed workshops and presentations to both elementary and high school students, as well as university groups, are well thought out and align with NSF's focus on broader impacts.

Moreover, the plan to disseminate findings via popular science outlets, such as Sapiens and Science Trends, shows an understanding of the need to communicate scientific research to a broader audience. However, it would be beneficial for the proposal to include details about how the effectiveness of these outreach efforts will be evaluated.

**Methodology:**
The methodology section is comprehensive and detailed, presenting a clear outline of how the research will be conducted. The integration of geometric morphometrics with traditional metric analyses is a sophisticated approach that enhances the robustness of the findings. The clear timeline provided for data collection and analysis indicates an organized and realistic project structure.

One area of concern is the reliance on specific species selection (as referenced with Quintanilla et al. (2017)), and whether the chosen methodology sufficiently accounts for potential biases in the access and selection of specimens. The proposal could explicitly address how sample selection might affect the generalizability of findings across the genus.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, this grant proposal articulates a significant research question within biological anthropology that has the potential to advance knowledge in this field substantively. It combines rigorous methodological approaches with a strong commitment to public engagement and education. Further elaboration on certain aspects of the methodology and broader impacts would strengthen the proposal, but overall, it is a promising application that merits funding consideration. 

**Recommendations:**
1. Expand on the implications of findings for paleoanthropology and taxonomy discussions.
2. Include a more detailed plan for evaluating the effectiveness of outreach and engagement initiatives.
3. Address potential biases in specimen selection and discuss the impact on the generalizability of results.

This proposal represents a significant step forward for research on the genus Macaca and its implications for understanding primate evolution and taxonomy.
