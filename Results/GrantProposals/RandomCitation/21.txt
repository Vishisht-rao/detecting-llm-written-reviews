**Review of Grant Proposal: "Incorporating Time Into the Study of Anthropogenic Land Use and Disease"**

**Summary:**
The proposal addresses a critical gap in understanding the relationship between anthropogenic land use, specifically deforestation, and the dynamics of zoonotic diseases. Drawing attention to the recent Ebola outbreak and the increasing incidence of zoonotic diseases, the applicant seeks to explore how varying stages of forest recovery impact disease dynamics, particularly focusing on mosquito-borne diseases like West Nile Virus (WNV). The research is timely and relevant, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive and dynamic approach to studying the implications of land use changes on disease ecology.

**Strengths:**

1. **Rationale and Relevance:**
   - The proposal begins by effectively establishing the significance of the study through a strong rationale that connects anthropogenic activities to disease outbreaks. The context of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa further substantiates the urgency of the research, highlighting the broader implications of land use changes on public health.

2. **Innovative Approach:**
   - This study's proposed methodology of incorporating temporal dynamics into disease modeling presents a novel perspective. By utilizing existing forest mosaics in Guinea, the applicant sidesteps the limitations posed by traditional long-term studies and addresses a crucial oversight in previous research, as noted by the applicant's reference to a more synthetic perspective (Helms et al., 2021).

3. **Clear Methodology:**
   - The proposed methods for data collection are rigorous and well-structured, utilizing established techniques for surveying bird and mosquito populations. The design is comprehensive with a clear description of how the analysis will be conducted, including statistical methods that will enable a thorough examination of data across different recovery states.

4. **Broader Impacts:**
   - The application emphasizes a commitment to utilizing research findings for community benefit, including education initiatives and collaboration with local health institutions. This focus on dissemination and application of results enhances the proposal's impact.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Lack of Preliminary Data:**
   - While the proposed study is innovative, it lacks a preliminary data section that could demonstrate the feasibility of the methodology and provide insight into expected outcomes. Including pilot studies or preliminary results would bolster the proposalâ€™s foundation and give reviewers greater confidence in the research design.

2. **Temporal Considerations:**
   - Although the proposal aims to examine temporal dynamics post-disturbance, the specifics regarding how these changes will be monitored and measured over time are somewhat vague. Detailed plans for long-term monitoring of ecological recovery and disease dynamics would strengthen the proposal.

3. **Potential Confounding Variables:**
   - The proposal briefly mentions the environmental conditions and agricultural practices as factors but does not elaborate on how they will be controlled for in the analysis. A more detailed discussion of potential confounding variables, and strategies to account for them, would demonstrate the robustness of the study's design.

4. **Mentorship Commitment:**
   - The intentions to mentor local scientists and build capacity are commendable, yet the proposal lacks specific details on how this mentorship will be structured. Providing a clearer plan for engagement with local researchers would enhance this aspect of the broader impacts.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this grant proposal presents a significant and timely research agenda that promises to contribute valuable insights into the interplay between land use and disease dynamics. With some revisions, particularly concerning preliminary data and methodological clarity, the application has the potential to make substantial contributions to the field of ecohealth. I recommend that the applicant strengthen the proposal by addressing identified weaknesses to enhance the likelihood of successful funding.
