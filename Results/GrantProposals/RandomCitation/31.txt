### Review of NSF Grant Proposal: "The Prediction and Interpretation of Protein pKa's using QM/MM"

#### Overall Impression
The grant proposal presents a robust and well-articulated plan to develop and apply a new quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) computational methodology for the prediction and interpretation of protein pKa values. The research is grounded in a significant body of previous work, addresses current limitations in computational modeling of protein pKa, and has a clear practical application in protein engineering.

#### Significance and Innovation
The proposal tackles a highly relevant challenge in biochemistry—accurately predicting the pKa values of ionizable residues in proteins. Given the critical role that pKa values play in protein stability, function, and design, the research has the potential to significantly advance the field of computational biochemistry. The methodological advancements proposed could provide insights into ionizable groups whose pKa values are poorly predicted by existing models. This originality, combined with anticipated advances in computational techniques, underscores the innovation of the proposed research. 

Moreover, the use of three-layered QM/MM methodologies provides an innovative framework that sets this work apart from existing approaches. It would enrich understanding regarding the impacts of hydrogen bonding and water molecules on pKa shifts, which have historically been overlooked.

#### Methodology
The methodology is comprehensive and well-structured. The proposal includes a detailed plan for developing the QM/MM methodology, alongside specific objectives that delineate multiple protein case studies (turkey ovomucoid, ubiquitin, and xylanase). Each objective is supported by a solid theoretical foundation, demonstrating a clear link between the proposed computational methods and the biological questions being addressed.

The proposal also effectively integrates computational experiments into teaching, enhancing the educational impact of the research. This aspect of the project will not only contribute to the training of students but also facilitate knowledge transfer within the broader scientific community as algorithm developments will be made available in GAMESS.

#### Clarification and Focus
While the proposal is strong in many respects, a few areas warrant clarification. For example, the description of prior results from the PI’s previous grant (CHE-9974502) could be more concise, focusing on the relevant impacts of the computational resources obtained rather than extensive detail about equipment specifications. Additionally, including more explicit milestones or timelines for project completion would help in assessing progress throughout the grant period. 

#### Expected Outcomes and Impact
The expected outcomes outlined in the proposal are ambitious and align well with the overarching objectives. The integration of the newly developed methods into practical applications in protein design and catalysis is particularly commendable. It would be beneficial if the proposal outlined any mechanisms for future collaboration with experimental groups to validate the computational predictions, thereby enhancing the project's translational potential.

Moreover, the anticipated ability to model or predict unusual pKa values could catalyze further research into enzyme design and function. This has significant implications not only in basic research but also in applied sciences, including pharmaceuticals and industrial biotechnology.

#### References
The proposal cites an impressive array of foundational literature, providing a solid context for the proposed work. However, it might benefit from elaborating on more contemporary studies that align closely with its aims, particularly recent advancements in QM/MM methods. Curiously, while the list of references is quite extensive, it appears to overlook key works such as those by Lowrance et al. (2014), which discuss applications of QM methods in biophysical chemistry and could provide additional context and support for the proposal's significance.

#### Conclusion
Overall, the proposal presents a compelling case for funding, highlighting both its scientific merit and its potential contributions to education and practical application. With minor adjustments for clarity and focus, this proposal could significantly advance the field of computational protein chemistry and the understanding of pKa in the context of protein function. I recommend approval for funding, considering the potential high impact of the proposed research.
