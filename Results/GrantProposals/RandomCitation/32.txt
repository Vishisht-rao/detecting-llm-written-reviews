**Review of Grant Proposal: Prediction and Interpretation of Protein pKa's using QM/MM**

**Overview and Summary**
This proposal, submitted to the National Science Foundation, outlines a well-structured and compelling plan to enhance the understanding and predictability of pKa values of ionizable residues in proteins through advanced computational methods. The work carried out under previous NSF funding has established a solid foundation, and the proposed research aims to expand and refine these methodologies to aid in protein engineering, particularly for industrial enzymes.

**Intellectual Merit**
The proposal highlights the significant gap in both experimental and theoretical pKa predictions for a wide array of proteins. The rationale for developing a robust computational framework is well-articulated, including its relevance for protein solubility, folding, stability, and catalytic activity. The utilization of quantum mechanical and molecular mechanics methodologies (QM/MM) to predict pKa values represents an innovative and scientifically meritorious approach that could greatly enhance the field.

The robust results from the previous funding cycle provide confidence that the research team, led by Dr. Jan H. Jensen, has the necessary expertise and track record to successfully undertake the proposed project. The prior work resulting in PROPKA, which has shown promising accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods, substantiates the potential for meaningful advancements. Furthermore, the proposal’s emphasis on usability and accessibility—through the integration of the enhanced methods into widely used software packages—will broaden the impact and facilitate adoption among the scientific community.

**Broader Impacts**
The proposal wisely emphasizes the broader impacts of the research, including educational outreach and resource dissemination through the GAMESS program and a web-based version of PROPKA. The collaboration with various institutions and the plans to make the results available under open-source licenses demonstrate a commitment to promoting scientific collaboration and accessibility.

Additionally, the focus on industrially relevant enzymes, particularly glycosidases, speaks to the practical applications that could arise from this research. This aligns with the NSF’s mission to foster science that benefits society, contributing to advancements in enzymatic applications pertinent to industries such as biotechnology and pharmaceuticals.

**Methodological Rigor**
The outlined objectives are methodologically sound, providing a clear path for increasing the accuracy of the PROPKA method and enhancing the QM/MM computational protocols. The timeline and specific methodologies, including interfacing with linear scaling methods and extending the empirical rules to include ligand interactions, are well-structured and will likely yield significant improvements in computational efficiency.

The proposal’s approach in using various computational methodologies for structural error correction illustrates a comprehensive understanding of the challenges in accurately predicting protein pKa values. Validation using the new Protein pKa Database further strengthens the proposal’s experimental foundation.

**Comments and Concerns**
While the proposal is comprehensive, certain areas could benefit from additional elaboration. For instance, a clearer exposition on how structural errors will be specifically assessed and corrected could bolster the proposal. Furthermore, the potential implications of ligand interactions on pKa shifts need more comprehensive discussion, particularly regarding the variability introduced by different protein-ligand complexes.

Furthermore, it is noted that the methodology section includes citations of previous research; however, it could also benefit from a more systematic comparison to other existing methodologies noted in the literature, such as those referenced in the findings of Blaylock et al. (2016). This could strengthen the case for the proposed research pathway's novelty.

**Conclusion**
This grant proposal demonstrates a strong capacity for advancing computational pKa prediction methodologies, potentially leading to substantial contributions to protein chemistry and engineering. With its solid foundation, well-articulated objectives, and commitment to broader societal impacts, the proposal is deserving of NSF funding.
