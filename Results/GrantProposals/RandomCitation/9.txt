**Review of Grant Proposal by Kevin Burgio**

**Intellectual Merit: Excellent**

Kevin Burgio’s proposal presents a compelling and coherent investigation into the physiological limits of torpor in monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus), a subject that has not previously been explored in detail within avian biology. The applicant's academic credentials, highlighted by an outstanding GPA and numerous prestigious awards, underscore his capability for success in this field. Burgio's previous research experience in studying the nesting behaviors and invasive aspects of monk parakeets logically culminates in the proposed project, which seeks to examine their adaptive strategies in colder climates.

The framework of the research is well-conceived, comprising three clear and testable hypotheses. The incorporation of both field and laboratory methodologies strengthens the proposal, allowing for robust data collection and analysis. The applicant's prior work has resulted in a submitted manuscript, which establishes a foundation for this research; however, it would further enhance the proposal to reference any accepted or published papers, or to note presentations at regional or national conferences, enhancing Burgio’s overall profile as a researcher.

The proposal references the potential impact of the applicant’s findings on our understanding of the ecological dynamics surrounding invasive species, which adds to its value. However, the review of literature appears to be somewhat limited. For instance, the proposal could benefit from exploring any related academic works, particularly to determine if torpor is documented in any other parrot species. It would be worthwhile to consider studies that link fat utilization and behavior adaptations in birds, supporting the hypothesis with empirical evidence, such as "Peabody et al. (2024)," which discusses the dietary adaptations of tropical birds to temperate climates.

**Broader Impacts: Excellent**

The broader impacts of this proposal are commendably integrated throughout the application. Burgio demonstrates a strong commitment to community involvement and public outreach, especially through his work already conducted with utility companies and conservation organizations. His plans to use a dedicated website for citizen science engagement and educational outreach are exemplary and indicate foresight in connecting scientific endeavors with community needs.

However, the proposal lacks detailed strategies on how K-12 and undergraduate students could actively participate in Burgio's research, which would further enrich the educational element of the project. Such involvement could foster interest in science and inform the younger generation about invasive species and conservation challenges, thereby addressing knowledge gaps in the community.

Overall, Burgio's proposal not only embodies a rigorous scientific investigation with considerable potential contributions to the field of ecology and avian studies, but also reflects a strong commitment to public engagement and education. With a grant from the National Science Foundation, the applicant is poised to make significant strides in both research and community outreach, aligning scientific discovery with societal impact. 

In summary, I recommend that the strengths of this proposal be recognized and supported, emphasizing the importance of continued exploration of the adaptive mechanisms utilized by monk parakeets in their invasive context while enriching community engagement concurrently.
