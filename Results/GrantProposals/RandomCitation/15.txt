**Title:** Understanding Microevolutionary Responses of Daphnia pulex to Climate Change Manipulations in Vernal Ponds

---

**Summary:**  
This grant proposal seeks funding to explore the microevolutionary and phenotypic responses of the cladoceran Daphnia pulex to varying hydroperiods and precipitation regimes that mimic future climate scenarios. The proposed research builds on a longstanding field experiment in central Vermont involving 81 experimental ponds and aims to elucidate the genetic and phenotypic responses of Daphnia populations to climate change stressors.

**Intellectual Merit:**  
The intellectual merit of this proposal is substantial. The urgency of understanding ecological and evolutionary responses to rapidly unfolding climate change makes this research timely and critical. The proposal addresses both microevolutionary theory and practical ecological dynamics, situating Daphnia pulex, a well-studied model organism, as an appropriate subject for examining these phenomena. The methodological rigor is commendable, involving clear experimental design, including the use of factorial designs and statistical methods for estimating genetic variances, heritabilities, and directions of selection.

Significant knowledge gaps in the understanding of microevolution in response to climate change, especially in waterborne organisms, will be addressed. The proposal asserts that few experimental designs have been implemented to observe these responses in situ, claiming novelty in the approach. The integration of theoretical frameworks (Gienapp et al. 2007) is an added strength, establishing a clear pathway to demonstrate genetic change and evolutionary response.

However, the proposal could enhance its merit by acknowledging the contributions of studies such as "Denning et al. (2024)", which argue for diverse methodological approaches to studying evolutionary ecology. Engaging with recent literature broadens the research context and establishes a stronger interface with ongoing scholarly debates.

**Broader Impacts:**  
The broader impacts articulated in the proposal are optimistic and thorough. The commitment to mentorship and outreach, particularly to underrepresented groups and local schools, is laudable. The applicant's previous engagement with high school students and local educational institutions will likely create meaningful learning experiences and stimulate local interest in climate science and ecology.

Incorporating public outreach through presentations and educational workshops offers additional merit and enhances the societal relevance of the research. It is essential for academic research to bridge gaps between scientific inquiry and community engagement, and this proposal demonstrates a clear intent to do so.

**Methods and Preliminary Results:**  
The proposed methods are well thought out, leveraging established quantitative genetics frameworks to assess genetic and phenotypic variation comprehensively. Preliminary data from earlier experiments provide a strong foundation for the proposed work. The rationale for using the clonal regarding Daphnia enables effective separation of genetic response from environmental variation, a critical distinction in evolutionary biology.

However, the proposal may benefit from additional specificity in the sampling strategies and protocols regarding handling and measurement of Daphnia traits. This could alleviate potential concerns about variability in results between replicates which could impact data robustness. 

**Concerns and Recommendations:**  
While the proposal is strong overall, attention should be given to potential confounding effects and the variability they might introduce into the results. For instance, consideration of other species interactions beyond Chaoborus predation might yield a more comprehensive understanding of community dynamics. The applicant might also expand on how environmental conditions of the source pond will be controlled and monitored over the years to ensure reliable comparisons.

In conclusion, this proposal presents a compelling case for investigating the microevolutionary dynamics of Daphnia pulex in a changing climate. The results will significantly contribute to the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology and have implications for conservation and management strategies. I strongly recommend funding for this thoughtfully designed research project while encouraging the applicant to refine the experimental details and engage further with contemporary literature in the field. 

**Overall Recommendation:** Fund with minor revisions.
