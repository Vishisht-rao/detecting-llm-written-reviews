**Title: Optimizing Monitoring Protocols for Elusive Avian Species of the Rallidae Family in Southeast Australia**

**Project Summary:**
The proposal's aim to develop a monitoring protocol targeting the Rallidae family in Australasia showcases its relevance and potential impact in the field of avian ecology. The focus on optimizing survey timing to increase detection probability is a critical approach for elusive species that are subject to low detection rates. The methodology, utilizing automated recording units, is innovative and well-justified in the context of the challenges faced in traditional monitoring methods. The selection of four species within the southeastern Australasian Rallidae allows for a broader understanding of various species’ responses and enhances the potential applicability of the study findings.

**Intellectual Merit:**
This proposal identifies a significant gap in existing literature regarding effective monitoring protocols for rails in Australia. The comparison with the National Marsh Bird Monitoring Protocol in North America adds robustness to the intellectual rationale. The project’s design is sound and offers a clearly structured experimental framework, which is supported by extensive previous research. The innovative use of automated recording units not only enhances data accuracy by minimizing observer bias but also allows for less invasive monitoring in remote areas. However, the proposal could benefit from clearer delineation of how findings from this study will directly influence existing or future conservation efforts.

**Broader Impacts:**
The proposed outreach efforts and mentorship of undergraduate students demonstrate a commitment to education and fostering new talent in the field. The PI’s active use of social media platforms like Twitter for public engagement is commendable and aligns well with modern outreach strategies to promote STEM diversity. However, while the inclusion of underprivileged communities in education efforts is mentioned, a more detailed plan on how engagement will be accomplished could strengthen this section. Additionally, it would be beneficial if the proposal outlined specific metrics for evaluating the success of outreach activities.

**Methodological Rigor:**
The methodological approach is robust, employing a clear timeline for data collection and analysis. The use of a results-based stopping rule for sampling is particularly innovative, reflecting thoughtful consideration of resource optimization. The proposed statistical analyses appear appropriate given the study design. However, there is a lack of specificity about how potential confounding variables (e.g., varying weather conditions, habitat disturbances) will be controlled or accounted for in analysis. Moreover, it could enhance the proposal’s rigor if it referenced similar methodologies, as seen in studies such as Lincoln et al. (2016), to bolster its credibility.

**Data Management and Dissemination:**
The data management plan is comprehensive and outlines clear strategies for data storage, preservation, and public access post-project. The use of platforms like Dropbox and GitHub for storage and dissemination reflects an understanding of best practices in data management. However, providing more detail on how data quality and integrity will be maintained throughout the project would strengthen this section.

**Budget Justification:**
The budget appears reasonable, with clear allocations for personnel, equipment, and travel expenses. However, additional detail regarding cost-sharing arrangements and how those will be employed to bolster project objectives would enhance this aspect of the proposal.

**Overall Evaluation:**
The grant proposal is well-structured and addresses an important and under-researched area in avian ecology. The use of technology to enhance monitoring efforts and the proposed collaborations hint at a research study poised to make significant contributions to the field. By addressing the minor gaps in methodological clarity, outreach strategy, and expansion on confounding variables, the overall impact of the proposal would be even stronger. I recommend funding this proposal with the expectation that the aforementioned areas for improvement are addressed in the final version of the proposal. 

**Recommendation: Fund with Minor Revisions.**
