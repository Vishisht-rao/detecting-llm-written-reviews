### Grant Proposal Review

**Title:** Investigating evolutionary mechanisms that facilitate local adaptation via inversions in the Atlantic silverside

**Overall Impression:**
This grant proposal presents a well-structured and ambitious research project focused on understanding how chromosomal inversions facilitate local adaptation in the Atlantic silverside, *Menidia menidia*. The proposal is comprehensive, logically organized, and shows a clear connection between the research aims and broader implications for evolutionary biology. The integration of common garden experiments, genomic analysis, and computational modeling is particularly commendable, as it promises a holistic understanding of the mechanisms involved in local adaptation.

**Strengths:**

1. **Intellectual Merit:**
   - The proposal addresses fundamental questions regarding local adaptation and speciation, which are central to evolutionary biology. The focus on chromosomal inversions as a structural genomic variant is timely and relevant, given the increasing recognition of their role in adaptive evolution.
   - The research aims are clearly articulated, with specific hypotheses and predictions laid out for each research question. The combination of empirical and computational approaches demonstrates a strong methodological foundation and innovative thinking.

2. **Broader Impacts:**
   - The proposal commits to the principles of open science and reproducible research. This is particularly pertinent in today’s scientific landscape where transparency and accessibility are paramount. The plan to conduct workshops targeted at early-career researchers and students from minority-serving institutions powerfully highlights the project's potential to foster an inclusive scientific community.
   - The proposal emphasizes training and mentoring undergraduate students, which will not only provide them with useful research experience but also contribute to their professional development.

3. **Research Design and Methodology:**
   - The detailed methodology, including common garden experiments and whole-genome sequencing, is robust and well thought out. The use of haplotagging for haplotype-resolved genotyping is a particularly advanced technique that positions the project at the forefront of genomic research.
   - The proposal includes a strong plan for data management and sharing, which ensures that the results of the research will be accessible to the broader scientific community.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Literature Review:**
   - While the proposal cites relevant literature, it could benefit from a more thorough discussion of previous work on the topic. For instance, the inclusion of Giordano et al. (2022) could provide additional context regarding chromosomal inversions and local adaptation.
   - A more extensive exploration of the existing studies on *Menidia menidia* could strengthen the rationale for the research and highlight specific gaps that this project aims to fill.

2. **Feasibility:**
   - The timeline outlined in the Gantt chart appears ambitious, particularly in balancing the extensive fieldwork, laboratory experiments, and data analysis. Greater specificity regarding contingency plans for potential setbacks (e.g., delays in sample collection or phenotyping) would enhance the feasibility of the proposed work.
   - While the transformative potential of this research is well-justified, the proposals for analyses could be elaborated, particularly concerning data expected from the GWAS and subsequent simulations. More detail on statistical methods and expected challenges in data integration would benefit the proposal.

3. **Clarity and Precision:**
   - The proposal's language is generally clear; however, there are instances of vague phrasing that may hinder the reader’s understanding. For example, specifying the “precise” ecological conditions that will be considered when analyzing local adaptation could enhance clarity.
   - Some sections appear overloaded with jargon, which may alienate reviewers who are experts in different disciplines. Simplifying the language and providing concise explanations for technical terms would improve accessibility.

**Conclusion and Recommendations:**
Overall, this grant proposal presents an exciting and potentially groundbreaking project that could significantly enhance our understanding of local adaptation through structural genomic variants. It demonstrates both intellectual merit and broader impacts that align well with funding agency goals.

To strengthen the proposal:
- Consider adding more depth to the literature review, particularly including recent studies that directly relate to the project's objectives.
- Elaborate on the feasibility of the timeline and provide potential solutions for mitigative actions in the event of unforeseen delays.
- Simplify some language to ensure clarity and accessibility to a broader audience.

With revisions addressing these aspects, this proposal would offer a compelling case for funding.
