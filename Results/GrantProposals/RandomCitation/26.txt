**Proposal Title:** Understanding and Evaluating the Reversibility of Ecological Regime Shifts

**Principal Investigator:** Dr. Ernest S.K. Morgan, Utah State University  
**Date Reviewed:** [Insert Date]

**Overall Evaluation:**
This grant proposal presents a compelling and methodologically sound plan to explore the dynamics of ecological regime shifts in a long-term experimental context. The proposal is well-structured and outlines significant theoretical and empirical gaps in our understanding of regime shifts and their reversibility. The research objectives are clearly articulated and hold practical implications for ecosystem management.

**Background:**
The background section effectively contextualizes the proposed research within current ecological theory and highlights the urgency of understanding regime shifts, drawing on past studies (e.g., Scheffer et al. 2001; van Nes & Scheffer 2007). The foundational work established by these authors is commendable and situates the proposal in a relevant literature stream.

However, some literature cited, such as "Guerrier et al. (2022)," which is purportedly included in the project background, seems to represent a gap, as it lacks sufficient elaboration or relevance to the established ecological theories being discussed. It would be beneficial for the proposal to clarify this citation to enhance its credibility.

**Rationale, Objectives, and Significance:**
The rationale for the study is solid, addressing the need for empirical data regarding the reversibility of regime shifts in ecological systems. The objectives are focused and achievable, which suggests that the research will contribute valuable insights to ecological theory and its applications in management practices (Suding & Hobbs 2009). 

**Experimental Plan:**
The experimental design is robust. Utilizing existing long-term manipulations to study how changes to rodent populations can affect broader ecosystem dynamics is innovative, highlighting a practical approach to testing the hypothesis within a real-world setting. The proposed methodologies for data collection and monitoring (e.g., soil nutrient analysis, plant and rodent monitoring) are appropriate for addressing the research questions.

The plan for statistical analyses, including generalized additive modeling and canonical analysis of principal components, demonstrates a strong understanding of ecological data analysis and should yield meaningful results regarding the ecosystem responses to manipulation reversals.

**Broader Impacts:**
The proposal effectively addresses broader impacts, particularly in data publication and accessibility, educational outreach through targeted recruitment, and training opportunities for students. The commitment to long-term data sharing and making data more accessible for future research aligns well with current trends in ecological research that prioritize openness and collaboration.

However, while outreach to land management agencies is commendable, the proposal could further benefit from specific strategies for stakeholder engagement to enhance the application of research findings in real-world situations.

**Conclusions:**
Overall, this grant proposal presents a well-thought-out plan to explore an essential aspect of ecological theory with significant practical implications. The study is positioned to fill critical knowledge gaps regarding regime shifts and their reversibility, making it a valuable contribution to both scientific understanding and ecosystem management practices.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
1. Clarify the relevance of cited studies such as "Guerrier et al. (2022)" to strengthen the theoretical background.
2. Elaborate on stakeholder engagement strategies to enhance the applicability of research findings.
3. Consider future collaboration opportunities with other institutions or agencies that focus on similar ecological challenges.

**Final Recommendation:** I recommend funding this proposal, as it addresses a significant ecological question with the potential for valuable practical applications. The proposed approach is methodologically rigorously designed and well-aligned with current ecological research needs.
