**Review of Grant Proposal: "Submesoscale-Resolving Large Eddy Simulations Using Reduced Biogeochemical Models"**

**Overall Assessment:**  
The proposal presents a compelling and innovative approach to addressing the interactions between biogeochemical tracers and turbulent processes at submesoscales in the upper ocean. The integration of advanced computational techniques with traditional oceanographic models represents a significant advancement in understanding tracer patchiness, particularly in the context of climate change and ocean carbon cycling. 

**Intellectual Merit:**  
The intellectual merit of the proposed project is high. The proposal capitalizes on state-of-the-art large-eddy simulations (LES) and introduces novel approaches to model reduction and integration that have been effectively employed in combustion science. By leveraging techniques such as directed relation graphs and the high-order Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev time integration scheme on GPU architectures, the project aims to yield significant insights into upper ocean dynamics and biogeochemistry. The specific research questions posed are relevant and address key gaps in current understanding, particularly concerning the effects of small-scale turbulence on reactive tracers like CO2 and phytoplankton. The emphasis on validating model outputs with observational data from the Drake Passage enhances the proposal's scientific rigor and feasibility.

**Broader Impacts:**  
The project demonstrates a strong commitment to broader impacts, particularly through its emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration and education. The inclusion of a diverse research team comprising experts in various relevant fields is commendable. The proposed outreach activities, including engaging underrepresented undergraduate students and extending findings to the general public through social media and presentations, are appropriate and well-articulated. These efforts have the potential to foster interest in oceanographic research among K-12 students as well. Furthermore, the accessibility of developed biogeochemical modeling tools to the broader oceanographic community is a positive aspect that extends the project's impact.

**Response to Previous Reviews:**  
The proposal has effectively addressed the critiques raised in the previous review cycle. By enhancing the clarity of scientific objectives and hypotheses, as well as providing a concrete plan for undergraduate involvement and community engagement, the revised document presents a more balanced and comprehensive proposal. Furthermore, the strengthened methods section and the addition of plans for external validation of modeling results enhance the credibility and scientific basis of the project.

**Methodological Rigor:**  
While the methodological approach is largely thorough and well-defined, there is room for further clarification regarding the validation methods. The proposal should include more specific details about how observed data will be used to assess model performance. Additionally, it would be beneficial to elaborate on how discrepancies in model predictions will be systematically identified and addressed. This could provide a clearer pathway for potential refinements to the proposed models.

**Budget Justification:**  
The budget appears reasonable in light of the ambitious scope of the project. The reduction from the original request demonstrates a consideration for funding agency constraints and enhances the projectâ€™s feasibility. However, a stronger justification for specific budget items, particularly those related to outreach programs and student support initiatives, would further strengthen this section.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
1. Enhance the description of validation methods and external comparisons of model predictions with observational data from the Drake Passage.
2. Provide more specificity in the outreach and engagement strategies to detail how the involvement of underrepresented groups will be promoted effectively.
3. Clarify the long-term sustainability of the modeling tools developed and how they will continue to benefit the oceanographic community post-project.

**Conclusion:**  
In conclusion, the proposal is ambitious, well-structured, and addresses critical questions related to the interactions of biogeochemical processes and turbulence in the ocean. If funded, the project has the potential to make substantial contributions to the field of oceanography and biogeochemistry, with implications for climate science and policy. Overall, I recommend this proposal for funding, contingent on the minor revisions suggested above.

**References:**  
Hatley et al. (2016) have discussed the significance of coupling physical and biogeochemical models, which aligns well with the objectives of this proposal and further emphasizes its relevance within the current scientific discourse.
