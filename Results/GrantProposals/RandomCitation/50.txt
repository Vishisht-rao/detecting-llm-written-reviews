**Review of Grant Proposal: "Investigating the value of automatically-gathered software impact data"**

**Overview:**
This proposal, submitted by Heather Piwowar and Jason Priem, aims to investigate methods for automatically gathering metrics on the impact of research software. The project seeks to enhance the open-source application ImpactStory by facilitating the collection and reporting of meaningful impact data that researchers can use for evaluations tied to grants, tenure, and promotions. The proposal fits within the EAGER grant framework as it proposes an innovative and exploratory approach to a pressing issue in the research community.

**Intellectual Merit:**
The intellectual merit of the proposal is significant. The authors articulate a compelling rationale for why existing methods of measuring software impact are inadequate, focusing on the disincentives for researchers to share their software. The proposed three-part research plan, which includes a quantitative scoping study, surveys of researcher attitudes, and qualitative analyses, is systematic and well-structured. The authors make a strong case for needing such data metrics to recognize the value of software in the research process.

Innovations like text mining for citations and engagement metrics from software repositories such as GitHub are potentially transformative for the field. Furthermore, the proposal's potential to influence future research practices and funding decisions augments its intellectual appeal. However, the authors do need to provide preliminary evidence or case studies highlighting successful exemplars of similar efforts to strengthen their claims.

**Broader Impacts:**
The broader impacts of this research are equally compelling. As articulated, enhancing software reusability benefits research efficiency, reduces redundancy in software development, and can stimulate a healthier research ecosystem. Their commitment to open access and open-source principles through the release of code and data adds considerable value to the proposed project. However, the proposal could be further strengthened by specifying how the findings will be disseminated to stakeholders beyond the academic community, including policymakers, technology users, and the public.

Additionally, collaboration with a broader range of disciplines could provide more diverse insights into software impact. The engagement plan is well thought out, targeting a relevant advisor community; yet, including additional outreach to underrepresented communities in software research might further enhance broader impacts.

**Feasibility:**
The feasibility of the research is addressed well, with thorough plans for community engagement, systematic data collection, and the use of existing tools and frameworks. However, there are inherent risks associated with negotiations for text-mining rights with major publishers. The authors should address contingency plans if negotiations fail or if they encounter other obstacles, such as resistance to change in research communities.

**Budget Justification:**
The budget appears reasonable given the scope of the project and the proposed personnel involved. The allocation of funds for legal advice, management of text-mining contracts, and community outreach are prudent and necessary. Nonetheless, a clearer breakdown of the time commitment for roles like consultants and developers would enhance understanding of the financial request.

**Limitations:**
While the proposal presents a strong case, some limitations need to be acknowledged:
1. Potential Resistance: The authors need to address potential resistance from researchers who may be hesitant to adopt new practices or include automatically-gathered metrics in evaluations.
2. Complexity of Impact Metrics: The complexity in defining what constitutes meaningful impact metrics may lead to qualitative biases, a concern that should be addressed.
3. Generalizability: The specific context of research software in certain fields may limit the applicability of findings across diverse domains.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, Piwowar and Priem's proposal offers a timely and innovative investigation into improving how the impact of research software is tracked and understood. By focusing on the increasingly critical need to validate software as legitimate scholarly output, this project has the potential to revolutionize practices in software reuse and acknowledgment in the research process.

I recommend funding this proposal, with the condition that the authors provide additional details on risks associated with publisher negotiations and broaden their outreach to include underrepresented communities in their engagement efforts.
