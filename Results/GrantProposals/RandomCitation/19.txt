**Review of Grant Proposal: "Revisiting Homo Taxonomy: A Geometric Morphometric Analysis of the Hominin Skeleton" by Brittany Kenyon-Flatt, PhD**

**Overall Assessment:**

The proposal by Dr. Brittany Kenyon-Flatt presents a compelling and ambitious project aimed at revisiting the taxonomy of genus Homo through geometric morphometric analysis. It articulates a significant research gap concerning the morphological variability within this genus and proposes novel methodologies to address longstanding questions in paleoanthropology. The integration of cutting-edge technology such as 3D scanning and geometric morphometrics is particularly commendable and has the potential to contribute substantially to the understanding of human evolution.

**Strengths:**

1. **Clear Research Objectives:** The proposal clearly delineates three specific aims that focus on morphological variation, taxonomic assessment, and the behavioral drivers of morphological diversity. Each aim is well-justified and linked to the overarching problem of defining genus Homo.

2. **Innovative Methodology:** The use of geometric morphometrics and advanced statistical methods, including Principal Components Analysis and Discriminant Function Analysis, is timely and appropriate given the complexity of the morphological variations discussed. The proposal acknowledges existing gaps in research concerning postcranial remains and addresses these effectively.

3. **Interdisciplinary Approach:** The project bridges multiple disciplines, integrating aspects of biology, paleontology, and anthropology. This interdisciplinary framework is likely to yield comprehensive insights into both morphological characteristics and evolutionary implications.

4. **Broader Impacts:** The proposal outlines a thorough plan for outreach, including public engagement through blogs and educational initiatives. This emphasis on disseminating science to the public and K-12 education highlights a commitment to broader impacts and is commendable.

5. **Training and Career Development:** The proposal reflects a strong commitment to mentoring and teaching future scientists. The focus on developing a course on geometric morphometrics is particularly noteworthy, as it addresses the need for training in modern techniques.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Literature Review:** While the introduction provides a solid foundation, the inclusion of relevant and more recent literature could strengthen the proposal. As noted, the citation of a paper by Musa et al. (2018) was notably absent, which could provide additional context to the discussion on morphological variation in primates and hominins.

2. **Feasibility of Data Collection:** The proposal indicates the need for several data collection trips to various institutions. It would benefit from a clearer timeline regarding when these trips will take place and provisions in case of unforeseen circumstances that could affect access to collections.

3. **Statistical Analysis Clarity:** While the statistical methods proposed are clearly outlined, additional details on how statistical assumptions will be validated could enhance the rigor of the proposed analyses. The proposal could also include possible limitations of these analyses and strategies for addressing them.

4. **Justification of Landmarks:** The development of a landmarking scheme is a critical aspect of the project. More detailed justification of the selection process for landmarks, especially given the fragmentary nature of some fossils, would strengthen the methodological framework.

5. **Resource Contingency Plans:** While the proposal mentions access to required equipment and resources, it could elaborate on contingency plans should these resources become unavailable. This would showcase preparedness and enhance the proposalâ€™s robustness.

**Conclusion:**

Dr. Kenyon-Flatt's proposal is a well-structured and innovative approach to tackling the complex issues surrounding Homo taxonomy. The integration of advanced methodologies with a strong outreach component reflects a promising project that stands to make significant contributions to the field of paleoanthropology. By addressing the areas for improvement, particularly regarding the literature review and statistical analysis details, the proposal could be further strengthened. I recommend this proposal for funding, as it aligns well with the goals of the National Science Foundation and has substantial potential for advancing scientific knowledge and education in the field.
