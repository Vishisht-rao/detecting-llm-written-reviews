### Review of Grant Proposal: Integrating Fossil and Extant Data for Phylogenetic Inference and Biology Education

#### Summary
The proposed project aims to integrate fossil and extant data using advanced methods for inferring dated phylogenetic trees, specifically through the fossilized birth-death (FBD) model, while also addressing important educational aims around computational biology and student retention, particularly for underrepresented minority (URM) students. The intellectual merit is high, as the project seeks to develop practical guidance and software tools for biological researchers to enhance the understanding of complex phylogenetic models. The educational component proposes significant interventions aimed at improving computational skills in the biology curriculum and promoting retention of diverse students.

#### Intellectual Merit
The intellectual merit of the research components is particularly strong. The introduction of FBD methods to model diversity within the Formicidae clade and the associated challenges in reconciling different data sources is timely and critical. There is a prominent issue in phylogenetics concerning model adequacy and the assumptions underlying these models, and the proposal deftly addresses this by suggesting advanced statistical methods such as posterior predictive checks. This could lead to robust insights not only in evolutionary biology but also in broader contexts where large datasets are explored. 

However, the proposal could benefit from a slightly clearer layout of the expected outcomes and potential implications. The preliminary results are promising, but additional context on how these results may influence existing theories or methodologies in systematic biology would enhance the justification for the work. Furthermore, the literature review could be expanded to clarify how this research builds upon previous methodologies (as noted in Kindred et al. (2014)) and to highlight its innovation.

#### Broader Impacts
The broader impacts of this grant are compelling, particularly regarding the focus on URM student retention in STEM. Addressing the retention of vulnerable student demographics is a pressing issue, and the proposed educational interventions, including research stipends and the integration of computation in early biology courses, are well thought out. However, the proposal would benefit from a more detailed description of how the success of these interventions will be measured. While longitudinal surveys are planned, specific metrics or criteria for success would strengthen this section.

The collaboration with federal student assistance programs like TRiO and Upward Bound is commendable, as it builds a support system to help students navigate their academic and career paths in computational biology. The proposal should clarify how many students are anticipated via these efforts and how diverse representation will be ensured.

#### Research and Education Plan
The research design is comprehensive, encompassing both theoretical advancements and empirical applications in model fitting. The structure of integrating computational education within biology is well-explained, especially the "code-to-learn" framework. However, additional focus on potential challenges or obstacles in implementing these computational strategies in traditional biology curricula would be beneficial. Discussing the faculty's preparedness and willingness to adopt these methodologies could provide a more grounded perspective on the educational plan.

The mentoring plan for postdoctoral researchers is also adequately detailed, as it emphasizes development and skill acquisition through mentorship and independent projects. A further elaboration on how the mentoring impact will be assessed over time, particularly with respect to the postdoc's own research career trajectory, could enhance the proposal.

#### Budget Justification
The budget is detailed and appears well-aligned with the proposed activities. The allocation for personnel, including stipends for URM students, is particularly appropriate given the stated goals of the proposal. Further clarifications regarding the specifics of the networked data storage and computational equipment purchases, particularly the relevance to data management practices, would add clarity to the justification.

#### Summary
Overall, this proposal presents a strong argument for both innovative research in the field of phylogenetics and meaningful educational practices aimed at enhancing computational abilities in biology. It addresses significant challenges in both scientific research and higher education. Clarifications and expansions on specific areas could enhance its effectiveness, particularly around assessment methodologies, broader impacts, and potential obstacles in implementation. 

Ultimately, the proposal's aim to bridge critical research and education in biology is commendable and could have meaningful impacts on both the fields of systematic biology and the academic trajectories of diverse student populations.
