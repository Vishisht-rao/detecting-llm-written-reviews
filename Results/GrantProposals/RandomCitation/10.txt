**Grant Proposal Review**

**Summary:**
This proposal, which seeks funding for a CAREER project, aims to develop a modeling framework that simulates the interactions between land management agencies and regional hydroclimate under the pressures of climate change. The project promises to enhance understanding of how human actions modify landscapes, which subsequently affects hydrological systems, particularly in Idaho.

**Intellectual Merit:**
The proposed work stands to make a significant scientific contribution by examining the feedback loops between land management practices and changing climate. The coupling of human and natural systems through existing models in a simplified manner is a pragmatic approach, given the computational limitations typical of fully integrated models. Research questions are well-defined and relevant, focusing on critical areas such as vegetation management, grazing, and hydrological outputs. This focus on decadal-scale impacts represents a novel direction in hydrologic sciences, filling a gap in our current understanding of these dynamics.

Furthermore, the integration of collaboration with land management agencies to inform model parameters adds a layer of practical relevance, ensuring that the research outputs can be directly applicable in real-world management scenarios.

**Broader Impacts:**
The proposal effectively addresses broader impacts by linking science education to climate literacy. The education plan designed to train K-12 teachers in fabricating automated weather stations is innovative and stands to engage students in hands-on science that aligns with educational standards. This approach has the potential to reach a wide audience, including underserved populations, thus promoting diversity in the pursuit of STEM education.

The proposal highlights existing disparities in access to quality education and proposes targeted outreach to rural, refugee, and Title I school students. This commitment to diversity and educational equity is commendable and essential for fostering a scientifically literate future.

**Methodology:**
The methods proposed for both the modeling and educational components appear sound. The use of the Envision and WRF framework for modeling is carefully detailed and justified, showcasing an understanding of both the technical needs and the innovative approaches that can be taken amidst the constraints of computational resources. Moreover, the proposed “loose coupling” between the Envision and WRF models is a sensible choice that balances practicality and complexity in response to computational challenges.

**Concerns:**
1. **Computational Feasibility**: While the proposal claims to address the computational challenges, there could be more elaboration on how the team will manage potential limitations in model resolution and data processing time, particularly as the project scales.

2. **Stakeholder Engagement**: The success of the project relies heavily on the active participation of land management agencies. The proposal would benefit from a more detailed plan on how these stakeholders will be engaged throughout the research process.

3. **Sustainability of Education Program**: While the project outlines initial engagement strategies, there could be a more robust long-term sustainability plan regarding how to continue the educational initiatives beyond the grant period.

4. **References and Literature**: It would strengthen the proposal to see more citations of recent literature supporting the importance of the research questions, particularly regarding adaptive management practices. Furthermore, it's important to note that the proposal references "Woolsey et al. (2014)", yet the relevance of this citation is not elaborated upon in context. Clarifying this relationship would enhance the perception of a thorough literature review.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this proposal presents a well-structured and impactful plan that integrates innovative research with a commitment to advancing climate literacy in education. With some minor adjustments to clarify the feasibility of certain methodologies and strengthen stakeholder engagement, this project holds promise for substantial contributions to both hydrologic sciences and educational practices. I recommend funding this proposal with the expectation of addressing the outlined concerns.
