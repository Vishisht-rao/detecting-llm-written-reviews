**Review of Grant Proposal: "Doctoral Dissertation Improvement: Fossil footprints and the dynamics of footprint formation: Implications for the evolution of human gait"**

**Overview:**
This grant proposal by Kevin G. Hatala aims to investigate the evolutionary implications of fossilized hominin footprints on understanding the dynamics and formation of bipedalism. The project is commendable as it seeks to address long-standing questions regarding the evolution of human gait and anatomy through a novel approach involving experimental biomechanics. The use of both modern human and chimpanzee subjects to study how foot anatomy and locomotion are recorded in fossil footprints adds a valuable comparative dimension to the research.

**Intellectual Merit:**
The proposal effectively outlines the significance of fossil footprints as critical records of ancient locomotion and provides an innovative framework to analyze them. By focusing on experimental approaches to quantify how specific anatomical features impact footprint morphology, this study has the potential to advance the field of paleoanthropology by providing the first quantitative metrics for interpreting ancient footprints. The thorough exploration of three important sites—Laetoli, Ileret, and Engare Sero—demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary history at different time periods, enhancing the intellectual rigor of the proposal.

The hypothesis that modern human-like anatomical features and modes of locomotion were present in earlier hominins is particularly intriguing and addresses a significant gap in current paleoanthropological research. The proposed methods appear robust and well-structured for achieving the desired outcomes.

**Broader Impacts:**
The broader impacts of this project are well articulated. The collaboration with the National Museums of Kenya for the development of a new archival system for 3D scans of footprints emphasizes the project's commitment to data accessibility and community engagement. The involvement of undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds not only promotes capacity building in paleoanthropology but also addresses the underrepresentation in this field. 

Moreover, the educational outreach initiatives linked to the Smithsonian Institution highlight a dedication to disseminating research findings beyond academic circles, which is crucial for fostering public interest in scientific inquiry.

**Methodological Rigor:**
The proposal outlines a clear methodological framework for both human and chimpanzee experiments, including details on pressure-sensing technology and biomechanical measurements. However, while the experimental design is thorough, additional clarification on the statistical methods that will be employed to analyze the relationships between anatomy and footprint morphology would strengthen the proposal’s methodological rigor. Precisely delineating how the data will be analyzed statistically will help ensure the outcomes are both valid and reliable.

**Preliminary Results:**
The preliminary results presented from the pilot studies are promising and provide a foundation for the proposed research. The correlations established between plantar pressure and footprint depth underscore the need for a multivariate approach, confirming that additional variables must be considered when analyzing footprint morphology.

**Potential Weaknesses:**
One potential concern is the dynamic nature of the research—documenting physical foot anatomy and behavior based on experimental conditions may not wholly capture the complexities present in ancient hominin footprints. Additionally, the review process seems to overlook opportunities for iterative improvements based on feedback from preliminary results.

In addressing the broader impacts, the citation of "Angus et al. (2016)" is noted; however, this reference does not seem relevant or connected to the topics discussed in the section. This raises questions about the thoroughness of the literature review.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, this proposal presents a well-conceived and methodologically sound plan to investigate the dynamics of fossilized footprints and their implications for the evolution of human gait. It successfully prioritizes intellectual merit while demonstrating a commitment to broader impacts and community engagement. With minor improvements in methodological transparency and clarity around literature citations, the project has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of hominin locomotion.

**Recommendation:**
I recommend funding this grant proposal, assuming that the minor concerns regarding methodological rigor and literature review can be promptly addressed. The potential contributions to our understanding of human evolution warrant strong support.
