**Review of Grant Proposal: Materials and Workshops for Cyberinfrastructure Education in Biology**

**Proposal Overview:**
The proposal aims to address the evident gap in computational skills among biologists by developing comprehensive educational materials and workshops, fostering collaboration across multiple BIO centers. The identified challenges, particularly in computational practice, data management, and pedagogical strategies, are significant obstacles within the biological sciences. The planned initiatives, including the extension of existing online materials, in-person workshops, and assessment strategies, are justified by the increasing demand for computational training and the limited current offerings.

**Strengths:**
1. **Identified Educational Gaps:** The proposal does an exemplary job of identifying and articulating the key challenges faced by biologists in acquiring computational skills, particularly the lack of structured training in mathematics and programming in existing curricula.
   
2. **Collaborative Approach:** By leveraging existing resources and training programs from institutions like BEACON, NESCent, and iPlant, the proposal demonstrates a strong collaborative spirit that is likely to enhance the program's outreach and effectiveness.

3. **Diverse Educational Strategy:** The planned educational initiatives are well-rounded, catering to different levels of computational competency, from introductory training to advanced workshops. This approach should facilitate a broad uptake across various expertise levels.

4. **Assessment Focus:** The inclusion of robust assessment strategies for evaluating the effectiveness of the training is a critical component of the proposal. Learning from previous evaluations, such as those by StemEd LLC, will inform adjustments and improvements in materials and delivery.

5. **Accessibility of Materials:** The commitment to making materials available under a Creative Commons license signifies a strong commitment to broadening access and fostering the reuse of educational resources.

**Potential Concerns:**
1. **Resource Dependency:** The proposal heavily relies on existing platforms and materials (e.g., Software Carpentry, ANGUS) for its foundation. While this is efficient, it raises potential concerns regarding sustainability and continuous improvement if these resources are not regularly updated.

2. **Oversubscription Issue:** Although the oversubscription of current workshops emphasizes demand, it also highlights the risk that the proposed interventions may not be sufficient to meet the needs of the biological community. Clear strategies for scalability and outreach should be implemented.

3. **Detailed Implementation Plan:** While the proposal outlines various components, a more detailed timeline and implementation strategy would strengthen the proposal. Specific milestones and metrics for success in each initiative would provide a clearer roadmap for evaluation.

4. **Variety in Learning Preferences:** The proposal mentions various modes of delivery, but it could benefit from a heightened focus on accommodating different learning styles. More interactive and tailored learning experiences could increase engagement and knowledge retention.

**Additional Comments:**
The proposal is well-researched and articulates a pressing need within the biological sciences for enhanced computational training. As the field continues to evolve, such educational initiatives will be critical in shaping a future generation of computationally proficient biologists. The review and adaptation of educational strategies will be important, as previous studies have indicated that existing methodologies may not always align with learners' needs (Doty et al., 2015). 

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this grant proposal addresses a fundamental aspect of modern biological research and education, fostering a more computationally adept scientific community. With some refinement in its detailed execution plan and a strong emphasis on continual improvement, this project holds great potential for meaningful impact.

**Recommendation:** 
I recommend funding this proposal, contingent on addressing the highlighted issues and enhancing the implementation plan with specific timelines and scalability strategies.
