Abstract: An approach to the construction of classifiers from imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of “normal” examples with only a small percentage of “abnormal” or “interesting” examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy.

1. Introduction: A dataset is imbalanced if the classes are not approximately equally represented. Imbalance on the order of 100 to 1 is prevalent in fraud detection and imbalance of up to 100,000 to

1 has been reported in other applications (Provost & Fawcett, 2001). There have been attempts to deal with imbalanced datasets in domains such as fraudulent telephone calls (Fawcett & Provost, 1996), telecommunications management (Ezawa, Singh, & Norton, 1996), text classification (Lewis & Catlett, 1994; Dumais, Platt, Heckerman, & Sahami, 1998; Mladenić & Grobelnik, 1999; Lewis & Ringuette, 1994; Cohen, 1995a) and detection of oil spills in satellite images (Kubat, Holte, & Matwin, 1998).
The performance of machine learning algorithms is typically evaluated using predictive accuracy. However, this is not appropriate when the data is imbalanced and/or the costs of different errors vary markedly. As an example, consider the classification of pixels in mammogram images as possibly cancerous (Woods, Doss, Bowyer, Solka, Priebe, & Kegelmeyer, 1993). A typical mammography dataset might contain 98% normal pixels and 2% abnormal pixels. A simple default strategy of guessing the majority class would give a predictive accuracy of 98%. However, the nature of the application requires a fairly high rate of correct detection in the minority class and allows for a small error rate in the majority class in order to achieve this. Simple predictive accuracy is clearly not appropriate in such situations. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a standard technique for summarizing classifier performance over a range of tradeoffs between true positive and false positive error rates (Swets, 1988). The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is an accepted traditional performance metric for a ROC curve (Duda, Hart, & Stork, 2001; Bradley, 1997; Lee, 2000). The ROC convex hull can also be used as a robust method of identifying potentially optimal classifiers (Provost & Fawcett, 2001). If a line passes through a point on the convex hull, then there is no other line with the same slope passing through another point with a larger true positive (TP) intercept. Thus, the classifier at that point is optimal under any distribution assumptions in tandem with that slope.
The machine learning community has addressed the issue of class imbalance in two ways. One is to assign distinct costs to training examples (Pazzani, Merz, Murphy, Ali, Hume, & Brunk, 1994; Domingos, 1999). The other is to re-sample the original dataset, either by oversampling the minority class and/or under-sampling the majority class (Kubat & Matwin, 1997; Japkowicz, 2000; Lewis & Catlett, 1994; Ling & Li, 1998). Our approach (Chawla, Bowyer, Hall, & Kegelmeyer, 2000) blends under-sampling of the majority class with a special form of over-sampling the minority class. Experiments with various datasets and the C4.5 decision tree classifier (Quinlan, 1992), Ripper (Cohen, 1995b), and a Naive Bayes Classifier show that our approach improves over other previous re-sampling, modifying loss ratio, and class priors approaches, using either the AUC or ROC convex hull.
Section 2 gives an overview of performance measures. Section 3 reviews the most closely related work dealing with imbalanced datasets. Section 4 presents the details of our approach. Section 5 presents experimental results comparing our approach to other re-sampling approaches. Section 6 discusses the results and suggests directions for future work.

2. Performance Measures: The performance of machine learning algorithms is typically evaluated by a confusion matrix as illustrated in Figure 1 (for a 2 class problem). The columns are the Predicted class and the rows are the Actual class. In the confusion matrix, TN is the number of negative examples
correctly classified (True Negatives), FP is the number of negative examples incorrectly classified as positive (False Positives), FN is the number of positive examples incorrectly classified as negative (False Negatives) and TP is the number of positive examples correctly classified (True Positives).
Predictive accuracy is the performance measure generally associated with machine learning algorithms and is defined as Accuracy = (TP + TN)/(TP + FP + TN + FN). In the context of balanced datasets and equal error costs, it is reasonable to use error rate as a performance metric. Error rate is 1 − Accuracy. In the presence of imbalanced datasets with unequal error costs, it is more appropriate to use the ROC curve or other similar techniques (Ling & Li, 1998; Drummond & Holte, 2000; Provost & Fawcett, 2001; Bradley, 1997; Turney, 1996).
ROC curves can be thought of as representing the family of best decision boundaries for relative costs of TP and FP. On an ROC curve the X-axis represents %FP = FP/(TN+FP ) and the Y-axis represents %TP = TP/(TP+FN). The ideal point on the ROC curve would be (0,100), that is all positive examples are classified correctly and no negative examples are misclassified as positive. One way an ROC curve can be swept out is by manipulating the balance of training samples for each class in the training set. Figure 2 shows an illustration. The line y = x represents the scenario of randomly guessing the class. Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is a useful metric for classifier performance as it is independent of the decision criterion selected and prior probabilities. The AUC comparison can establish a dominance relationship between classifiers. If the ROC curves are intersecting, the total AUC is an average comparison between models (Lee, 2000). However, for some specific cost and class distributions, the classifier having maximum AUC may in fact be suboptimal. Hence, we also compute the ROC convex hulls, since the points lying on the ROC convex hull are potentially optimal (Provost, Fawcett, & Kohavi, 1998; Provost & Fawcett, 2001).

3. Previous Work: Imbalanced datasets: Kubat and Matwin (1997) selectively under-sampled the majority class while keeping the original population of the minority class. They have used the geometric mean as a performance measure for the classifier, which can be related to a single point on the ROC curve. The minority examples were divided into four categories:
