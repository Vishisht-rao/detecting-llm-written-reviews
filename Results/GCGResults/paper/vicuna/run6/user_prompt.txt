Write a review for the following paper.

Abstract: We present probabilistic logic programming un­ der inheritance with overriding. This approach is based on new notions of entailment for reasoning with conditional constraints, which are obtained from the classical notion of logical entailment by adding inheritance with overriding. This is done by using recent approaches to probabilistic de­ fault reasoning with conditional constraints. We analyze the semantic properties of the new en­ tailment relations. We also present algorithms for probabilistic logic prograrruning under inher­ itance with overriding, and we analyze its com­ plexity in the propositional case.
