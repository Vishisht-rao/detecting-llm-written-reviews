Abstract: Social media anomaly detection is of critical importance to prevent malicious activities such as bullying, terrorist attack planning, and fraud information dissemination. With the recent popularity of social media, new types of anomalous behaviors arise, causing concerns from various parties. While a large amount of work have been dedicated to traditional anomaly detection problems, we observe a surge of research interests in the new realm of social media anomaly detection. In this paper, we present a survey on existing approaches to address this problem. We focus on the new type of anomalous phenomena in the social media and review the recent developed techniques to detect those special types of anomalies. We provide a general overview of the problem domain, common formulations, existing methodologies and potential directions. With this work, we hope to call out the attention from the research community on this challenging problem and open up new directions that we can contribute in the future.

1. INTRODUCTION: Social media systems provide convenient platforms for people to share, communicate, and collaborate. While people enjoy the openness and convenience of social media, many malicious behaviors, such as bullying, terrorist attack planning, and fraud information dissemination, can happen. Therefore, it is extremely important that we can detect these abnormal activities as accurately and early as possible to prevent disasters and attacks. Needless to say, as more social information becomes available, the most challenging question is what useful patterns could be extracted from this influx of social media data to help with the detection task.
By definition, anomaly detection aims to find “an observation that deviates so much from other observations as to arouse suspicion that it was generated by a different mechanism” [Hawkins 1980]. The common approach is to build a reference model, i.e., a statistical model that captures the generation process of the observed (or normal) data. Then for a new observation, we estimate its likelihood based on the reference model and predict the data as an “anomal” if the likelihood is below some threshold [Chan and Stolfo 1998; Ghosh and Schwartzbard 1999; Eskin et al. 2002; Ringberg et al. 2007; Yue et al. 2007; Chandola et al. 2007].
In addition, the type of anomalies that we aim to detect vary significantly from applications to applications. Several algorithms have been developed specifically for social network anomaly detection on graph structure anomalies, e.g. power law models [Akoglu and McGlohon 2009], spectral decomposition [Luxburg 2007], scan statistics [Priebe et al. 2005], random walks [Pan et al. 2004; Tong et al. 2006], etc. The basic assumption of these algorithms is that if a social network has fundamentally changed in some important way, it is usually reflected in the individual communication change, i.e., some individuals either communicate more (or less) frequently than usual, or communicate with un-

usual individuals. However, this could be an over-simplification of the social media anomalies without considering several important aspects of social media data.
One of the challenges that differentiate social media analysis from existing tasks in general text and graph mining is the social layer associated with the data. In other words, the texts are attached to individual users, recording his/her opinions or activities. The networks also have social semantics, with its formation governed by the fundamental laws of social behaviors. The other special aspect of social media data is the temporal perspective. That is, the texts are usually time-sensitive and the networks evolve over time. Both challenges raise open research problems in machine learning and data mining. Most existing work on social media anomaly detection have been focused on the social perspective. For example, many algorithms have been developed to reveal hubs/authorities, centrality, and communities from graphs [Kleinberg 1999; Erosheva et al. 2004; Song et al. 2005; Lappas et al. 2009]; a good body of text mining techniques are examined to reveal insights from user-generated contents [Blei et al. 2003; Rosen-Zvi et al. 2004]. However, very few models are available to capture the temporal aspects of the problem [Blei and Lafferty 2006; Hanneke and Xing 2007; Kolar et al. 2010], and among them even fewer are practical for large-scale applications due to the more complex nature of time series data.
Existing work on traditional anomaly detection [Chandola et al. 2012; Cheng et al. 2009; Chandola et al. 2007; Tong et al. 2008a; Guralnik and Srivastava 1999; Takeuchi and Yamanishi 2006; Duchêne et al. 2004; Lin et al. 2003; Keogh et al. 2005; Yankov et al. 2008; Cheng et al. 2009; Wong et al. 2003] have identified two types of anomalies: one is “univariate anomaly” which refers to the anomaly that occurs only within individual variable,
