Write a review for the following abstract.

Abstract: Objective  Africa ranks second of the 7 continents in 
population and geographical area. Reports of research from 
Africa are often labeled as being African in scope, a dubious 
claim given the low likelihood of analyzing data 
representative of 1.4 billion people. Accurate reporting of the 
scope of research studies in Africa avoids mischaracterization 
and bias that could have significant implications on health 
care resource distribution, research funding, and policy 
making. This study characterized the geographical scope of 
reports of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) conducted in 
Africa, because RCTs are most likely to inform clinical 
practice and policy.
Design  A tailored PubMed search was developed using 
Medical Subject Headings and keywords to represent Africa , 
African , and RCTs . Citations from January 1, 1968, to 
February 25, 2022, were included. Titles and abstracts were 
reviewed against established inclusion and exclusion criteria 
followed by a full-text review of included citations and data 
extraction. Based on the number of countries, studies were 
categorized as national (1 country), binational (2 countries), 
trinational (3 countries), multinational (≥4 countries), and 
continentwide (multinational, inclusive of all 5 subregions: 
North, Southern, Central, East, and West).Table 74. Characteristics and Data Collection Methods of

www. peerreviewcongress.org     155Results  A total of 285 RCTs met inclusion criteria, and only 1 
was continentwide. Of the 54 African countries, 14 (25%) 
were not represented in the published RCTs. The top 3 
countries were in East Africa, namely, Kenya (80), Uganda 
(79), and Tanzania (56). Studies were reported as African 
(201 [71%]), sub-Saharan African (45 [16%]), West African 
(16 [6%]), East African (14 [5%]), Southern African (7 [2%]), 
and East + Central or West + Central African (2 [<1%]). The 
median number of countries included by reported scope was 
2 (IQR, 1-3) overall, and similar in African and sub-Saharan 
African studies; 3.5 (IQR, 2-4) in East African studies; 1 (IQR, 
1-2) in West African studies; and 2 (IQR, 2-2) in Southern 
African studies. A total of 124 studies (44%) were national, 66 
(23%) were binational, 33 (11%) were trinational, and 62 
(22%) were multinational. Of 201 studies reported as African, 
91 (45%) were national, 49 (25%) were binational, 21 (10%) 
were trinational, 39 (19%) were multinational, and 1 (<1%) 
was continentwide. Among the 45 (16%) sub-Saharan African 
studies, 20 (45%) were national, 6 (13%) were binational, 9 
(20%) were trinational, and 10 (22%) were multinational. 
Among the 14 (5%) East African studies, 2 (14%) were 
national, 3 (22%) were binational, 2 (14%) were trinational, 
and 7 (50%) were multinational. Of the 16 studies (6%) 
conducted in West Africa, 10 (62%) were national, 3 (19%) 
were binational, and 3 (19%) were multinational. Among the 
7 RCTs from Southern Africa, 1 (14%) was national, 5 (72%) 
were binational, and 1 (14%) was trinational.
Conclusions The scope of RCTs from Africa is rarely 
continentwide, and 1 in 4 countries is not included.
