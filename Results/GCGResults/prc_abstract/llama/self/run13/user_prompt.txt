Abstract: Objective The Yale Open Data Access (YODA) Project 
enables researchers to access shared participant-level clinical 
research data for independent secondary and replication 
studies.1 The project, because it requires an application, 
provides an opportunity to determine how published analyses 
compare with the initial aims and the degree to which any 
deviance is noted in the publications. Accordingly, the 
objective of this study was to evaluate the concordance among 
the included trials, the study objectives, and the statistical 
methods specified in researchers’ requests to the YODA 
Project for Johnson & Johnson clinical trial data, the primary 
YODA data sharing partner, and their corresponding 
publications.
Design In this cross-sectional study, all approved YODA 
requests for Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical or medical 
device data that had 1 corresponding English-language 
publication or more were identified (from the first request in 
2018 to October 29, 2021). From each request-publication 
pair, the primary objectives were classified as fully, partially, 
or not at all concordant. Primary and secondary end points 
were classified as fully concordant, partially concordant (≥ 1 
additional primary or secondary end point in the request or 
publication), or discordant (≥ 1 secondary end point dropped 
or converted to a primary end point, primary end point 
converted to a secondary end point, or secondary and primary 
end points swapped). Given that slight methodological 
changes may have been necessary once researchers had 
access to the shared data, statistical methods were classified 
as concordant if the pairs described the same broad 
methodological approaches.Results  Forty-eight requests on the YODA Project website 
with 1 publication or more in a peer-reviewed journal were 
identified. Of the 48 request-publication pairs, 33 (68.8%) 
had a fully concordant overarching study objective, and 13 
(27.1%) had a partially concordant overarching study 
objective ( Table 17 ). There were  28 pairs (58.3%) for which 
all of the requested trials were included in the analyses 
described in the publications; 17 pairs (35.4%) had articles 
that included fewer trials than the number of trials specified 
in the request. There were 31 pairs (64.6%) with fully 
concordant primary end points and 25 pairs (52.1%) with 
fully concordant secondary end points. Only 1 pair had fully 
concordant primary and secondary end points. Most pairs (39 
[81.3%]) had concordant statistical methods; there were no 
pairs that were fully concordant across all proposal details.
Conclusions: None of the YODA Project requests were fully 
concordant with their corresponding publications describing 
the completed research, most often because fewer trials were 
used than requested. These findings suggest that investigators 
using data from data sharing platforms should explain Table 17.  Concordance Between Yale Open Data Access Project
