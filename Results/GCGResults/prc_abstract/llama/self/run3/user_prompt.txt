Abstract: Objective  A previous study revealed that patient-reported 
outcome measures (PROMs) with poor or unknown 
psychometric properties were associated with higher 
estimates of treatment effect in clinical trials of rotator cuff 
diseases.1 This study assessed the variations in meta-analysis 
estimates in orthopedics associated with varying quality of 
PROMs and hypothesized an average higher estimate in 
PROMs with unknown and poor psychometric properties.
Design  Meta-analyses were identified from 5 databases from 
inception through October 16, 2017. PROM scores were 
derived from a prior publication that comprehensively 
assessed the quality of these instruments (higher scores were 
better quality).2 Standardized mean difference (effect size) or 
mean difference of change in PROM scores (from before 
treatment to after treatment) between different treatment 
types were extracted or calculated for each study. For those 
studies that did not report standardized results, change scores 
were divided by the SD for standardization. The SD was 
imputed in some cases from SEs and CIs. A mixed-effects 
regression analysis was done, with all standardized change 
scores as dependent variables and other data as independent 
variables (PROM overall quality score, number of studies, 
total sample size across included studies, and average 
follow-up), controlling for the grouping variable meta-
analysis (in which multiple estimates were calculated for 
several PROMs from within the same meta-analysis). A 
sensitivity analysis was done excluding meta-analytic 
estimates for mixed interventions. Increases in β coefficients 
indicate effect size change for each unit increase in PROM 
quality.
Results  A total of 249 unduplicated meta-analyses on rotator 
cuff disease were reviewed with 47 being included, with 6 
different PROMs included, and several meta-analyses 
included mixed outcomes with several PROMs being 
combined. Reviews were excluded (202) primarily because 
one of the PROMs of interest was not used. The β coefficient 
for PROM quality and the pooled effect size estimates was 
−0.012 (95% CI, −0.049 to 0.025; P = .53) before and after 
controlling for several covariates ( Table 77 ). In the 
sensitivity analysis, after removing meta-analyses with mixed 
PROMs in the pooled effect size estimates, the β coefficient 
for PROM quality and pooled effect estimates was −0.013 
(95% CI, −0.034 to 0.007; P = .19); this finding was not 
statistically significant.
Conclusions  In estimating the percentage of bias, this study 
found that pooled effect size estimates across PROMs of poor 
quality inflate effect estimates by approximately 10% (the 
ratio of the β estimate and meta-analytic estimate). This 
magnitude of effect size is not statistically significant, but larger methodologic studies may be warranted to confirm 
clinical significance.
