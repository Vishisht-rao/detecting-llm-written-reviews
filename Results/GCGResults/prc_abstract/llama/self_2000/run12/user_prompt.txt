Abstract: Objective  To analyze the proportion of spin strategies 
present in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) published in 
high-impact journals appraised at low risk of bias.
Design  For this cross-sectional study, a comprehensive 
search was made in Ovid MEDLINE, retrieving all RCTs 
published in the 10 highest-impact medical journals in 
medicine and surgery (by 2018 Journal Citation Reports 
impact factor) from January 1, 2018, to February 28, 2020. 
Stratified sampling was then performed of 150 articles, 
adjusted by journal. Then, the risk of bias of each RCT was 
assessed independently and in duplicate using the Cochrane 
risk-of-bias tool. For each included article, an adaptation of 
the classification scheme created by Boutron et al1 for RCTs 
was used to identify spin strategies in every section of the 
article.
Results  A total of 46 RCTs at low risk of bias were appraised 
using the spin classification scheme. From those included in 
the analysis, 25 studies were published in internal or general 
medicine journals and 21 in surgery journals. The number of 
patients included in the RCTs ranged from 20 to 12,000. The No. of r equests per month

Gender dif ferences in initial assessment: Senior editors equally engaged women and men r eviewing editors (REs) in the initial consultation. Wo men REs r esponded  
slightly less to senior editor’ s initial consultation r equests, and they took longer to r espond than did men REs. B, Men REs handled slightly more  full submissions per

0.47 (0.30 to 0.65)most spin was identified in the discussion and conclusion 
sections, with the most common strategies being focusing on 
statistically significant secondary outcomes (4 [8.7%]), ruling 
out adverse events (4 [8.7%]), acknowledging statistically 
nonsignificant results for the primary outcome but 
emphasizing the beneficial effect of treatment (4 [8.7%]), and 
focusing only on statistically significant results (5 [10.9%]). In 
subgroup analyses, a total of 38 spin strategies were identified 
in studies with nonsignificant primary outcomes vs 11 in 
studies with significant results. Assessment according to 
specialty identified 35 spin strategies in surgery journals and 
14 in internal medicine journals.
Conclusions  Overall, the use of spin strategies was found to 
be more common in studies with a statistically nonsignificant 
primary outcome vs those with a significant primary outcome. 
This study highlights the need to raise awareness about the 
use of spin, even in studies published in high-impact journals 
and at low risk of bias, as the use of these strategies can affect 
readers’ decision-making.
