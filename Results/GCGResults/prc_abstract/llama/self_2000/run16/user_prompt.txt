Abstract: Objectives  To investigate women’s representation among 
peer reviewers of medical journals overall and according to 
the gender of the editor in chief and women’s representation 
in the editorial board.
Design This cross-sectional study included journals of the 
BMJ Publishing Group that reported the names of their peer 
reviewers in 2020. For each journal, the gender of the editor 
in chief, deputy editors, and associate editors was determined 
based on photographs and pronouns available on the journal 
website or professional affiliations. The package genderizeR 
in R was used to predict the gender of the peer reviewers 
based on given names, which were extracted from full names 
and assigned as woman or man.
Results  Overall, this study included 47 of the 74 journals in 
the BMJ Publishing Group because data were not publicly 
available for the remaining journals ( Table 3 ). Women 
accounted for 30.2% of the 42,539 peer reviewers, with 
marked variation ranging from 8% in the  Journal of ISAKOS 
to 50% in Medical Humanities . Women represented 33.4% of 
the 555 editors, including 19.2% of the 52 editors in chief. 
There were 5 journals with more than 1 editor in chief, all of 
which had 2 men as editors in chief. There were 5 journals 
with no woman among the editors and 12 journals in which 
women’s representation as editors was 50% or greater. 
Among those 12 journals, 7 had a woman as editor in chief. 
There was a moderate positive correlation between the 
percentage of women as editors and as reviewers (Spearman 
correlation coefficient, 0.590; P < .001). The percentage of 
women as editors excluding editors in chief was higher when 
the editor in chief was a woman than a man (53.3% vs 29.2%; 
P < .001). The percentage of women as peer reviewers was 
also higher in journals with a woman as editor in chief 
compared with a man (32.0% vs 26.4%; P < .001). There was 
no significant correlation between women’s representation 
and the journal CiteScore (Spearman correlation coefficient, 
−0.288; P = .07) or impact factor (Spearman correlation 
coefficient, −0.343; P = .09). This study has some limitations, 
such as using binary prediction of gender based on given 
names, relying on data for accepted rather than invited
