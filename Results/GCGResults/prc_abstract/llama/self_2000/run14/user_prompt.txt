Abstract: Objective  According to meta-analyses and practice 
guidelines, benzodiazepines are effective in the treatment of 
panic disorder.1,2 However, to date, no meta-analyses have 
incorporated data from unpublished trials. Among all 
benzodiazepines, alprazolam is the most widely prescribed 
and has the highest frequency of nonmedical use, abuse, and 
related harms in the US.3 This study examined reporting bias 
with the extended-release (XR) formulation of alprazolam by 
comparing its efficacy for panic disorder using trial results 
from the published literature and the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA).
Design  There was no protocol for this study, and it was not 
registered. Medical and statistical reviews for alprazolam XR 
were downloaded from Drugs@FDA (https://www.
accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm); all phase 2 
and 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy 
trials were identified; summary statistics on 5 primary 
outcome measures were extracted; and the FDA’s regulatory 
decision as to whether, for purposes of approval, the trial 
provided evidence of efficacy (statistical superiority to placebo on all primary outcomes) was also extracted. For each 
FDA-registered trial, the published literature was searched 
for matching publications using PubMed, bibliographies of 
review articles, and Google Scholar. The best match between 
FDA-registered trials and publications was based on drug 
name, comparator, dosage groups, sample size, duration, and 
investigator name. Summary data on the drug-placebo 
comparison and whether the publication conveyed that the 
drug was effective were extracted. Two meta-analyses were 
conducted—one based on the FDA review and the other based 
on the published literature—and their effect sizes were 
compared. Reporting bias was examined by comparing the 
following: (1) overall trial results (positive or not) according 
to the FDA vs corresponding publications and (2) effect size 
(Hedges’ g) using FDA data vs published data. Risk of bias 
was not assessed because the objective was not to assess bias 
in trial methods (internal validity) but rather bias in results 
reporting.
Results The FDA review showed that 5 trials were 
conducted, only 1 of which (20%) was positive and published 
(as positive). The remaining 4 studies failed to demonstrate 
efficacy. Of those, 2 were not published; for the other 2, the 
articles selectively reported positive, nonprimary, or post hoc 
outcomes. Thus, according to the published literature, 3 of 3 
trials (100%) appeared to show positive results. Alprazolam’s 
overall effect size calculated using FDA data was 0.33 (95% 
CI, 0.07-0.59), while that based on published trial data was 
0.47 (95% CI, 0.30-0.65), an increase of 0.14, or 42% 
(Figure 29 ).
Conclusions  According to the results of this analysis, 
reporting bias has inflated the apparent efficacy of alprazolam 
XR, as previously found with other drug classes. Because this 
inflation alters the risk-benefit ratio, clinicians may wish to 
reconsider their prescribing practices with respect to this 
benzodiazepine. This study highlights the value of regulatory 
data to public health.
www. peerreviewcongress.org     167were compared between leading Chinese OA journals and 
control journals with nonparametric tests.
Results A total of 14 of 22 (63.64%) leading Chinese journals 
were OA journals. For 2 OA journals, there was no 
corresponding international OA journal; for another 2 OA 
journals, there was only 1 corresponding OA journal. 
Therefore, there were 22 control journals. The median (IQR) 
number of published documents (articles and reviews) per 
leading Chinese OA journal was less than that of the control 
journals (302 [243-352] vs 715 [390-2010]; P = .004); the 
median (IQR) citations per document (13 [9-26] vs 14 [9-25]; 
P = .99) and percentage of cited documents (94.81% [93.63%-
98.24%] vs 96.96% [92.64%-98.14%]; P = .76) were not 
statistically different. The median (IQR) normalized citation 
impact of the 2 groups was not significantly different (2.008 
[1.221-2.933] vs 2.003 [1.353-3.093]; P = .97), but the median 
(IQR) Eigenfactor score, which took into account both the 
number of citations and the academic influence of citing 
journals, of leading Chinese OA journals was lower than that 
of control journals (0.005 [0.003-0.007] vs 0.013 [0.005-
0.052]; P = .02]. There were fewer top 1% documents in 
leading Chinese OA journals (median [IQR], 10 [5-19] vs 34 
[11-65]; P = .02); however, the percentage of top 1% 
documents was not statistically different (median [IQR], 
4.54% [1.18%-5.82%] vs 3.84% [1.86%-6.86%]; P = .94). The 
average citations per top 1% document of leading Chinese OA 
journals were more than that of control journals, but the 
difference was not statistically significant (median [IQR], 103 
[52-134] vs 72 [58-105]; P = .26).
Conclusions Compared with top international OA journals, 
Chinese leading OA journals published fewer articles with 
similar average citations, but they were less cited by highly 
cited journals.
