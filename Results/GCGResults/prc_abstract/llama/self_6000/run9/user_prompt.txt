Write a review for the following abstract.

Abstract: Objective To assess whether strategies adopted by Brazilian 
journals for COVID-19 articles are associated with the 
increase of article submission and publication in 2020. Early 
assessments of medical journals worldwide since the outbreak 
of the pandemic showed that COVID-19–related articles were 
published faster than all articles before the pandemic.1
Design An online survey was conducted with Brazilian 
researchers from October to December 2020. After ethical 
approval, a questionnaire with closed questions about the associations of the pandemic with editorial tasks was sent by 
email. This analysis included the questionnaires answered by 
editors in chief who identified their journal name to assess 
whether policies adopted by Brazilian journals were 
associated with outcomes for submissions and publications in 
the first semester of 2020. Information on journal subject 
area, index source, open access status, whether the publisher 
was public or private, and charges for submission or 
publication was collected from journal websites. The 2021 
journal impact factor (JIF) was also collected for all journals. 
Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated by 
logistic regression adjusted by private or public publisher, 
charging status, and JIF.
Results In total, 1299 Brazilian researchers responded to the 
survey. Of 163 editors in chief who participated, 87 (53%) 
provided their journal name and were included in the 
analysis. Journal subject areas included the humanities (n = 
43), life sciences (n = 41), and exact sciences (n = 3). Most 
journals were open access (n = 85), one-third were indexed in 
Web of Science (n = 29), and a 2021 JIF was available for 18. 
Thirty-two publishers were private, and 21 charged for 
submission or publication. The scope of 58 journals covered 
topics related to COVID-19. Journals that adopted fast-track 
publishing had a greater increase in manuscript submissions 
(OR, 3.85; 95% CI, 1.42-10.41) and publications (OR, 3.03; 
95% CI, 1.20-7.63). Journals that invited manuscripts about 
COVID-19 also had a greater increase in submissions (OR, 
2.89; 95% CI, 1.13-7.40) and publications (OR, 2.57; 95% CI, 
1.03-6.38). The increase in publications was greater in 
journals that started to accept articles published as preprints 
(OR, 4.26; 95% CI, 1.26-14.38) and that opened a call for 
COVID-19 manuscripts (OR, 3.49; 95% CI, 1.22-10.00), 
whereas those that published an editorial about COVID-19 
had a greater increase in submissions (OR, 2.65; 95% CI, 
1.02-6.88). Publishing a dedicated COVID-19 issue did not 
affect the outcomes ( Table 68 ).
Conclusions Editorial changes in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic’s challenges were associated with an increase in the
