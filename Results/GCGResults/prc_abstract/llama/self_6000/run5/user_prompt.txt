Write a review for the following abstract.

Abstract: Objective Consensus methodologies are widely used to 
harness expert knowledge for decision-making in areas of 
uncertainty. While specific guidance is available on 
conducting and reporting Delphi initiatives in palliative care,1 there remains a need for broader reporting guidelines. The 
ACCORD (Accurate Consensus Reporting Document2) 
initiative will develop guidance for transparent and complete 
reporting of consensus-building methodologies in biomedical 
research and clinical practice. This abstract reports findings 
from a systematic literature review that will inform consensus 
on checklist items for ACCORD.
Design Studies, reviews, and guidance documents 
addressing the quality of reporting of consensus methods in 
biomedicine or clinical practice were eligible for inclusion. 
Reports of consensus methods that did not comment on 
reporting quality were excluded. Searches were conducted 
with no limits by year or language. Identified articles were 
retrieved and assessed for eligibility using Rayyan by 4 
evaluators working independently; discrepancies were 
reconciled by discussion. The search process started on 
January 7, 2022; the assessment period was completed on 
February 7, 2022. Data extraction was done using Covidence, 
and potential checklist items were generated.
Results Overall, 2736 references were identified: 2599 
articles and documents (Web of Science, 1775; MEDLINE 
[Web of Science], 1501 [202 unique]; PubMed, 375 [219 
unique]; MEDLINE [OVID], 641 [174 unique]; Embase, 331 
[66 unique]; Cochrane, 131 [77 unique]; Emcare, 179 [29 
unique]; Academic Search Premier, 280 [23 unique]; and 
PsycINFO, 173 [34 unique]) and 137 meeting abstracts (Web 
of Science, 14; Embase, 99 [90 unique]; Cochrane, 36 [33 
unique]). In all, 54 publications were selected for full-text 
review; 18 met the eligibility criteria. Most studies 
acknowledged that reporting quality of consensus initiatives 
could be improved. The most discussed items included panel 
composition and consensus definition and thresholds 
(Table 49 ). Public and patient involvement and roles of the 
steering committee and chair(s) were among the least 
addressed.
Conclusions Most identified studies acknowledged the need 
to improve reporting quality of consensus methodologies. 
ACCORD aims to set a standard for reporting consensus 
initiatives, improving their transparency and making it easier 
to critically appraise the methods used to develop consensus 
recommendations.
