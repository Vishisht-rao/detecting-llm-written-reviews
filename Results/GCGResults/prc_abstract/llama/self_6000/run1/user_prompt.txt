Abstract: Objective To quantify the administrative demands and 
timeliness of sharing individual participant data and identify 
the main choke points for researchers and contracts 
departments.
Design This mixed-methods study conducted in 2022 
included 2 case studies of individual participant data meta-
analyses, Individual Participant Data on Cord Management at 
Preterm Birth (iCOMP) and Transforming Obesity Prevention 
for Children (TOPCHILD), for which data were requested 
from international trials from 2019 until May 2022. Each 
contact with trial investigators was logged in custom-built 
software. From these logs, contact time points, study 
characteristics (eg, year, sample size, country), email texts, 
and data-sharing status were extracted. Researchers 
responsible for negotiating agreements were interviewed to 
identify choke points. The median, IQR, and range of time 
from the first data request until data receipt were calculated, 
and the number of emails required was tallied. Emails, 
data-sharing agreements, reasons data could not be shared, 
and interview responses were analyzed qualitatively using a 
thematic analysis to identify choke points and facilitators.
Results For 71 of 72 included trials (50 iCOMP trials [69%], 
22 TOPCHILD trials [31%]), data were directly requested and 
supplied from investigators. Only 1 data set was available as a 
publication supplement; none used data repositories. The 
median (IQR) time from requesting to receiving data was 88 
days (130 days). The longest completed request took 831 days 
(ie, >2 years). A mean of 23 emails (SD, 25; range, 4-49 
emails) were sent until data were received. While some data 
were shared in the requested format (26 trials [36%]), other 
data sets had to be recoded (46 trials [64%]), and substantial 
contact with the investigators was required for this. Workload Table 56. Key Themes From Interviews With Editors of Medical 
Journals on Adding Structured Results Tables to Journal  
Article Abstracts
Category Common Themes Expressed 
Potential benefits•  Scientific communication:  general enthusiasm for results 
table to improve communication of primary outcome 
results and limiting selective outcome reporting
•  Reader engagement: may entice readers to read more 
details about the methods and results in the full article
Potential harms •  Burden: may increase workload on both editorial staff  
and authors
•  Scientific concerns: table may not accommodate all types 
of study designs and methods; care needed to avoid 
selective results reporting and spin
•  Reader engagement: may discourage readers from 
accessing the full article if key content is already  
in abstract
Barriers to 
implementation•  Tables may take up too much space
•  Formatting requirements: PubMed and some publishers 
do not allow tables in the abstract, and it is not desirable 
to have 2 versions of abstract
• Author and editor time constraints
Other/general •  Strong interest in participating in trial of results tables
•  Several journals noted possible overlap with visual/
graphic abstracts

if institutions had executed agreements together previously. 
For 3 studies, data were not shared despite investigators 
being eager to do so because institutional approval could not 
be obtained. For iCOMP, 7 requests remained in progress 
after 854 days; for TOPCHILD, 9 requests were in progress 
after 272 days. Most data sharing agreements were similar in 
content but varied in detail and length (3-36 pages). The 
largest choke points included differences in regulations across 
jurisdictions and varying stakeholder expectations of rights 
and responsibilities (eg, institutional expectations about data 
storage, authorship rights). However, most emails dealt with 
minor change requests and clarifications.
Conclusions This study’s results demonstrate major delays 
in the process of data sharing from trials with requests 
remaining unresolved after 2 years. The similarities identified 
across agreements indicate opportunities for standardization. 
Data sharing delays consume financial resources and impair 
the timeliness of research, which is particularly problematic 
for research endeavors linked to emergency situations (such 
as the COVID-19 pandemic). Many researchers are willing, or 
required by journals and funders, to share their data. To 
overcome costly choke points and delays, streamlined 
standards and infrastructure are needed.
