Write a review for the following abstract.

Abstract: Objective  To evaluate the experience with a new peer review 
method,1 Select Crowd Review (SCR), for The Thoracic and 
Cardiovascular Surgeon . Upon submission, authors are 
given a choice to accept or decline SCR. A “crowd” was 
created in part from the existing reviewer pool and in part 
newly recruited. If authors agree to SCR, anonymized PDFs of 
manuscripts are made accessible to the crowd upon invitation Table 47. Characteristics of the Manuscripts Reviewed

b A second team member performed discrepancy review for each manuscript to examine 
consistencies and differences among discrepancy reviewer reports.
c In addition, 2 submitted manuscripts had permanent registrations on the OSF Registries

110     Peer Review Congressper email via an online platform for 10 days. This intuitive 
platform enables the crowd to enter comments directly into 
the text; a formal structured review is not required. Reviewers 
give their comments anonymized. An SCR editor summarizes 
the annotations and gives a recommendation. Both the 
commented PDF and summary are sent back to the authors 
through the editor in chief. The aim is to achieve a rapid and 
broader, and thus fairer, review process.
Design  All manuscript submissions from introduction in 
July 2021 until January 15, 2022, were analyzed regarding 
acceptance and quality. Anonymized cardiac manuscripts 
were sent to a preselected crowd of 45 reviewers and entered 
regular double-blinded peer review at the same time. 
Efficiency and performance of the crowd’s reviews were 
compared with that of regular reviewers. For thoracic 
manuscripts, a crowd was not yet available during this pilot 
period.
Results  Of 162 total submitted manuscripts, 72 (44.4%) were 
selected for SCR; 84 were cardiac manuscripts, 39 (46.4%) of 
which were selected for SCR. Ten of those had to be rejected 
without any review, and 29 finally entered SCR. A first review 
process was completed for 24 manuscripts. For 3 
manuscripts, the crowd did not respond. In all remaining 21 
papers, the crowd’s recommendation concurred with that of 
the regular reviewers, leading to 8 rejections. Regular peer 
review took up to 5 weeks. Nine manuscripts underwent 
repeated SCR after revision. On average, 3 (range, 0-9) crowd 
members sent in reviews. In revisions, average response was 
worse, with mostly only 1 previous reviewer responding.
Conclusions  SCR encountered good acceptance by authors. 
Because the first experience showed absolutely concordant 
recommendations within 10 days compared with the slower 
traditional review, thoracic manuscripts have been included 
to gain more experience. If positive feedback continues, SCR 
may become an established method of peer review in selected 
journals. It is certainly helpful to achieve a fast first 
evaluation. Efficiency apparently must be increased for 
re-review of revisions.
