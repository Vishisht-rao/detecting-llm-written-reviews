Abstract: Objective  Retracted clinical trials may be influential in 
systematic reviews and guidelines. Fanelli et al1 examined the 
impact of retractions on 50 meta-analyses and found little 
influence but suggested that the impact was likely variable 
and context specific. Using retracted clinical trial reports from 
one research group,2 responses of editors and authors to 
notifications that systematic reviews and guidelines they had 
published had cited the retracted trials were evaluated.
Design  Between November 2019 and January 2020, for 27 
retracted trials (published 1997 to 2012, retracted 2016 to 
2019) in osteoporosis and neurology, searches were No. of jour nals

www. peerreviewcongress.org     25conducted in Web of Science, Scopus, and researchers’ files 
for systematic reviews and clinical guidelines that cited the 
trials as evidence. Citing publications that acknowledged that 
they had cited retracted work were excluded. For each citing 
publication, 2 researchers independently coded the likely 
impact of removing the retracted trial reports, including 
findings likely to change (yes, no, or uncertain) and size of 
change (substantial, moderate, or minor). In a factorial 
design with 4 groups, authors of citing publications were 
randomized to receive up to 3 emails (if no reply) to the 
contact author and journal editor vs contact author only and, 
for citing publications with 2 or more authors, to an email to 
the contact author only vs up to 3 authors (selected from 
among contact, first, second, and final authors). Emails giving 
details of the retracted trials were sent monthly September to 
October 2020. Follow-up was 1 year for outcomes, assessed 
by replies to emails and notices in the public domain, 
including any reply (yes or no), time for a reply from first 
author, time for any reply, and action taken. Comparisons 
were undertaken using χ² tests. Email replies were analyzed 
for content by 3 researchers.
Results  A total of 88 citing publications (published 2003 to 
2020) were identified; 2 were corrected before emails were 
sent. Authors/editors were emailed about 86 citing 
publications. A total of 45 of 88 citing publications (51%) had 
findings coded likely to change if the retracted trials were 
removed, and 39 of these (87%) were likely substantial 
impacts. Replies were received for 44 of 86 citing publications 
(51%). Emailing 3 authors was more likely to elicit a reply 
than emailing the contact author alone (26 of 42 [62%] vs 16 
of 40 [40%]; P = .03), but including the editor did not 
increase replies (23 of 44 [52%] with editor vs 21 of 44 [48%] 
without editor; P = .66). Including more authors and/or the 
editor, whether findings were coded likely to change and the 
size of the likely change, had no effect on published corrective 
action. One year after emails were sent, only 9 publications 
had been corrected.
Conclusions  Retracted trials impact systematic reviews and 
guidelines. Emailing more authors to notify them of the 
retractions yielded more replies but did not increase 
corrections. Email alerts to authors and editors are 
inadequate to correct the impact of retracted publications in 
citing systematic reviews and guidelines. Publications with 
retracted citations should be marked until authors resolve 
concerns.
