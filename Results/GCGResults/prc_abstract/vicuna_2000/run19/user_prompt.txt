Write a review for the following abstract.

Abstract: Objective Over the past decade, there has been an 
exponential increase in systematic reviews and meta-analyses 
(SR/MAs) published in the medical literature, and some 
concerns have arisen that many of these are duplicate studies 
with redundant results or new studies of unclear quality.1-3 
The aim of this study was to determine whether there was any 
change in the methodological or reporting quality of SRs in 
dermatology over the past decade.
Design This was a cross-sectional study of all SR/MAs 
published in 2010 and 2019 in the 10 highest-ranked 
dermatology journals by SCImago Journal. Methodological 
quality was assessed through duplicate and independent 
adjudication by 2 reviewers (A.M., L.K.L., J.K., A.L.) using the 
Risk of Bias in Systematic reviews (ROBIS) tool and, for SR/
MA of interventions, the A Measurement Tool to Assess 
Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2 tool. Reporting quality was 
assessed by 1 investigator (A.M.) using the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA) and PRISMA for Abstracts (PRISMA-A) tools, and PRISMA 2009 sections

www. peerreviewcongress.org     189study, author, and journal characteristics were abstracted. 
Statistical analysis was performed with Jamovi, version 
1.6.23. Methodological quality was analyzed with the χ² test 
for independent proportions, or the Fisher exact test if any of 
the expected frequencies were less than 5, and difference in 
proportions with 95% CIs. Reporting quality was analyzed 
with the independent samples t test and difference in means 
with 95% CIs.
Results In total, 21 SR/MAs from 2010 and 127 from 2019 
were included There was little to no difference between 2010 
and 2019 in the proportion of SR/MAs at high or unclear 
overall risk of bias with ROBIS or with critically low 
methodological quality using AMSTAR 2. The only 
subdomain of ROBIS with a difference in proportion of SR/
MAs at high or unclear risk of bias between 2010 and 2019 
was eligibility bias, with 27.3% more (95% CI, 5.42%-49.2%) 
in 2010 (66.7%) than 2019 (39.4%) ( P = .02). There was a 
strong difference in proportion of PRISMA ( t146 = 3.15; 
P = .002) and PRISMA-A ( t146 = 2.46; P = .02) checklist items 
adequately reported between 2010 and 2019. The difference 
in mean proportion of PRISMA checklist items adequately 
reported was 3.8 items more (95% CI, 1.4-6.2 items more) in 
2019 (mean [SD], 15.7 [5.1] items) than in 2010 (mean [SD], 
11.9 [5.5]), and of PRISMA-A checklist items adequately 
reported was 0.9 items more (95% CI, 0.2-1.6 items more) in 
2019 (mean [SD], 5.9 [1.5] items) than in 2010 (mean [SD], 5 
[1.9] items).
Conclusions While there was an improvement in the overall 
reporting quality of SR/MAs between 2010 and 2019, there 
was no improvement in the overall methodological quality as 
assessed by the ROBIS and AMSTAR 2 tools. This suggests a 
persistent potential for forming unreliable conclusions in SR/
MAs through a decade of dermatological research. These 
results therefore highlight the urgency with which efforts to 
improve SR/MA methodology should be undertaken.

Objective  To assess the publication status and factors 
associated with subsequent publication of all pediatric 
intervention trials registered in the Clinical Trial Registry of 
India (CTRI) over a period of 5 years.
Design  This cross-sectional study was conducted from 
December 2021 to February 2022 and included the first 100 
pediatric intervention trials registered in the CTRI from 2008 
to 2012. Registry records were identified from the CTRI 
website using the keywords pediatric , paediatric , children , 
adolescent , infant , newborn , neonate , kids , and school . Trial 
characteristics (eg, blinding, type of intervention and 
comparator, setting, funding, source of funding, single or 
multicentric, and postgraduate thesis) were abstracted from 
each registered trial. A list of all the randomized clinical trials 
registered on the website was made and their subsequent 
publication was systematically searched on PubMed and 
Google Scholar using their registered CTRI number up to 
December 2021. For trials that were not found, repeat 
searches were performed, searching by the first author’s 
name, second author’s name, and title of the registered trial. 
The proportion of trials subsequently published and the time 
to publication from the date of registration were analyzed. 
Factors associated with publication were compared between 
trials that were published and those not published using χ² 
test and univariate analysis by calculating the odds ratio and 
95% CI. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted for 
factors with P < .50.
Results  The first 100 pediatric intervention trials registered 
from 2008 to 2012 were retrieved from the CTRI. The overall 
proportion of trials published was 71%; 87% had
