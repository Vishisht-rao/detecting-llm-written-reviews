Abstract: Objective  To perform a systematic review of available online 
training for scholarly peer review of biomedical journal 
articles.
Design  A search strategy was developed and reviewed using 
the PRESS (Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies) 
checklist by a medical librarian. A database search of 
MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, ERIC, and Web of Science 
was conducted. Additional supplementary searches were 
done of preprint servers, Google, YouTube, university library 
websites, publisher websites, and peer reviewâ€“related events 
and groups. All English or French training documents for 
scholarly peer review of biomedical manuscripts freely 
accessible online between January 1, 2012, and the date of the 
search (September 13, 2021) were included. January 1, 2012, 
was used as the earliest cutoff because this was the year 
Publons was launched. A Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow 
diagram with full exclusion criteria is shown in Figure 11 . 
Screening was done in duplicate by 2 independent reviewers 
in 2 stages, with conflicts resolved by a third party. Data 
extraction and risk of bias were done by 1 reviewer and then 
verified by a second. As no current risk of bias tool could be 
found for evaluating training material, one was created, 
which was pilot tested for feasibility. 
Results Of 1244 records screened, 45 online training 
documents were identified for peer review. Barriers such as 
paywalls and membership requirements limited access to just 
more than half of these documents (23 of 45 [51%]); thus, 
they were excluded from data analysis because they were not freely available online. The included documents were mostly 
websites (13 of 22 [59%]) and videos (6 of 22 [27%]) offered 
exclusively in English (19 of 22 [86%]). Many of the 
documents did not report a creation year (10 of 22 [45%]), 
author information (10 of 22 [45%]), or funding sources (19 
of 22 [86%]). Countries that developed the greatest amount of 
training were the US (8 of 22 [36%]), United Kingdom (4 of 
22 [18%]), and Germany (3 of 22 [14%]). The main training 
formats were online modules (13 of 22 [59%]) and webinars 
(5 of 22 [23%]) and took less than 1 hour to complete (15 of 
22 [68%]). Topics that were frequently included were an 
overview of the peer review process (18 of 22 [82%]), 
synthesis of a peer review report (20 of 22 [91%]), and critical 
appraisal of data (18 of 22 [82%]). Conversely, critical 
appraisal of clinical trials (4 of 22 [18%]), statistics (4 of 18 
[3%]), and reporting guidelines (9 of 22 [41%]) were less 
commonly included.
Conclusions  This systematic review identified a 
comprehensive list of available online training material for 
scholarly peer review of biomedical journals and an analysis 
of their characteristics.
