Abstract: Objective  Preregistration plays a key role in reducing certain 
biases in clinical trial conduct and reporting. Most studies on 
selective reporting have assessed discrepancies between the 
latest registry entry and the corresponding publication. 
However, ClinicalTrials.gov and the German Clinical Trials 
Register (DRKS) allow entries to be updated after initial 
registration, which allows researchers to add or change 
crucial details. Because studies look at only the latest registry 
entry, these later changes are not directly visible, which 
constitutes another source of possible reporting bias if larger 
changes go unreported. By assessing the entire audit trail, 
which was not easily accessible for mass download and 
analysis until recently, this study was a comprehensive 
analysis of outcome changes made within registry entries 
between key study time points and in corresponding results Table 48. Screening Checklist for Data Fabrication in

Design  Based on an existing data set of all trials conducted 
at German university medical centers between 2009 and 2017 
and registered in DRKS or ClinicalTrials.gov that had 
published results,1,2 all historical registry entries were 
obtained using the R package cthist.3 Historical trial 
registration records from the 2 databases were extracted and 
semiautomatically evaluated. For each trial, changes to 
primary outcomes between key study time points in the 
registry (first patient inclusion, completion, publication, and 
latest available version) and publication were extracted. 
These changes were then classified according to their severity, 
and associations with a number of candidate predictors of 
outcome changes at different trial stages were analyzed.
Results  Of 1747 included trials, 592 trials (33.9%) had an 
outcome change of some kind within the registration after 
study start. Analyses of outcomes in publications and the 
nature and severity of outcome changes are ongoing, and 
results will be presented at the conference. The study also 
examined whether and how outcome changes were reported 
in results publications and presented factors associated with 
outcome changes at different trial stages. 
Conclusions  A large proportion of clinical trials exhibited 
changes to prespecified outcomes within the registry after 
study start, and the nature of these changes is important to 
know for the integrity of the scientific process. This analysis 
provided further insight into outcome registration and 
reporting practices. Using methods reported in this study, 
peer reviewers, editors, readers, and metaresearchers may be 
able to assess the registration quality of a clinical trial.
