Abstract: Objective Informatics approaches have previously been used 
to assess open access (OA) rates for pharmaceutical 
company–supported publications.1 An updated method was 
developed using article type metadata supplied by Embase, 
aiming to improve differentiation between journal articles 
and published congress materials. Copyright license types of 
OA pharmaceutical company–supported journal articles were 
also identified.
Design Articles from 24 pharmaceutical companies were 
analyzed, including the top 20 companies by revenue (as of 
September 2021)2 and the 4 OpenPharma participant 
companies outside the top 20.3 A scholarly search aggregator 
(Lens.org) was used to identify articles with authors affiliated 
with each company, a field of study of medicine, and 
publication in 2019 or 2020. Only publications tagged as 
article by Embase were included. The OA status and copyright 
license type were evaluated through Unpaywall (a database of 
OA articles). The 2019 analysis was performed using the 
original method based on PlumX-supplied data to establish 
any differences between the 2 methods. Data collection 
occurred from July to September 2021.
Results For 2019, the updated method returned fewer total 
articles (5093) than the original method (6900), with an 
overall OA rate of 76%, an increase from 69%. Analysis of 1 
company with a known 100% OA rate revealed that in 2019, 
using the previous methods, 15 of 50 articles were classified 
incorrectly as non-OA; with the new method for the same 
data set, the number of articles was 2 of 37. The 2020 OA rate 
using the revised method was 77%, from a total of 5678 
articles. Excluding companies with fewer than 10 articles 
(2019, 2 of 24; 2020, 1 of 24), the range of company OA rates Table 40. Geographic Breakdown of Journal Counts and Open Access (OA) Status per Publisher Size Category

100     Peer Review Congresswas 67% to 95% in 2019 and 56% to 90% in 2020. 
OpenPharma company participants had higher OA rates than 
nonparticipants, and their OA rates increased from 2019 to 
2020 by 0.5 percentage point (77.1% to 77.6%) compared with 
1.5 percentage points for nonparticipants (74.6% to 76.1%). 
The most common copyright license types in the 8242 OA 
journal articles published in 2019 and 2020 combined were 
CC BY-NC-ND (29% of total articles) and CC BY (28% of 
articles) ( Table 41 ). Unpaywall was unable to distinguish the 
copyright license type for 21% of OA articles.
Conclusions The revised method improved accuracy of 
estimating OA rates for pharmaceutical company–supported 
articles by excluding incorrectly tagged publications identified 
with the original method, likely because Embase includes a 
manual step in their tagging. Almost half of the articles 
analyzed had a copyright license preventing commercial use. 
This analysis was restricted to only those articles with 
pharmaceutical company authors and articles tagged as 
“medicine”; therefore, this analysis does not encompass the 
full range of publications associated with the pharmaceutical 
industry. However, analyses using this method could help 
pharmaceutical companies, collaborating academic 
institutions, and publishers working toward greater openness 
and expanded reach of peer-reviewed publications.
