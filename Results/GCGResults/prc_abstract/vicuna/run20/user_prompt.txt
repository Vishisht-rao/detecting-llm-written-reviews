Write a review for the following abstract.

Abstract: Objective  To examine the levels of awareness, preferences, 
experiences, and practices of researchers in the health and life 
sciences regarding research and publication ethics.
Design  In this cross-sectional study, a questionnaire was 
deployed on Google Forms to a global audience. Reminder

aStudies using large databases, registries, or biobanks and those using previously published data. These now require an ethics statement according to  GIM  standards.
bOnly 35 studies were published in this journal in 2020.
94     Peer Review Congressemails and WhatsApp messages containing a brief description 
and a link to the online survey were sent through the various 
platforms until no new responses were received after 3 
reminders.  The form captured information regarding the 
sociodemographic characteristics of respondents. The 
questionnaire explored the level of awareness, training, 
attitudes toward, preferences, and experiences with research 
ethics committees. Regarding publication ethics, the 
awareness of respondents regarding the International 
Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) authorship 
criteria and their experiences with ghost authorship were 
evaluated. All researchers working in the health and life 
sciences were eligible to participate in the study.
Results  A total of 500  researchers were contacted, and 264 
responded (53.0%). Only 36.7% of respondents were aware of 
the ICMJE authorship criteria. Less than a quarter (22.0%) of 
the respondents were aware of the existence of an ethics code. 
Respondents’ experience with their most recent ethics 
approval application was poor (11.4%), good (36.0%), and 
excellent (4.2%). The practice of research teams to include 
authors with no or limited significant contribution to an 
article was frequent (44.3%), common (29.5%), and systemic 
(10.6%). More than 41.7% of the respondents had ever 
conducted a study involving human participant research 
without prior ethical approval. Respondents’ experience with 
their most recent ethics approval application was poor 
(11.4%), good (36.0%), and excellent (4.2%). Major challenges 
in obtaining ethical approval were too much bureaucracy 
(47.3%), ethical approval application cost (5.3%), and unduly 
long review turnaround in receiving feedback and decisions 
(3.8%). Most respondents (83.0%) worked in institutions that 
hosted a research and ethics committee. Less than half 
(42.4%) of the respondents had been formally trained in 
publication ethics.
Conclusions  Rates of ethical misconduct, such as having no 
ethical approval prior to conducting a study or gift and ghost 
authorships, were unacceptably high. Formal training in 
research and publication ethics should be institutionalized in 
the courses in universities and research institutions. 
Academic journals and funders have the duty to support 
researchers to uphold research ethics and research integrity 
standards. Institutionalization and awareness raising 
regarding these best practices are highly needed.
