Title: TD-MPC 2: Scalable, Robust World Models for Continuous Control

Summary:
The paper presents TD-MPC 2, an enhanced version of the TD-MPC algorithm for model-based reinforcement learning designed to address limitations in existing frameworks for generalist embodied agents. The authors propose improvements that bolster the scalability, robustness, and efficiency of model-based RL in handling multiple tasks using large datasets without requiring per-task hyperparameters. They offer a comprehensive study of TD-MPC 2's performance across 104 diverse continuous control tasks, spanning 4 task domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the novel algorithm displays superior performance over baselines, with increased agent capabilities as model size scales, and potential applications in several real-world scenarios.

Positive Aspects:

1. **Thoroughness**: The paper provides an exhaustive collection of experimental results covering a wide array of tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of TD-MPC 2 both individually and in a multitask setting.

2. **Innovation**: The use of innovations like SimNorm and the revised planning architecture is compelling and well-suited for their scaling objectives. The work on scalable multitask models without the need for hyperparameter tuning is particularly notable.

3. **Strength of Results**: Empirical results show consistent improvements over baseline methods. The results indicate potential for TD-MPC 2 to facilitate the development of robust generalist RL agents, marking an important advance in the field.

4. **Practical Applications**: The exploration of few-shot learning and generalist world models suggests the practical applicability of the approach in real-world scenarios beyond simulations, which is a beneficial step forward in the reinforcement learning community.

5. **Reproducibility**: The authors make commendable efforts towards reproducibility by providing access to models, code, datasets, and further documentation on a public platform.

Negative Aspects:

1. **Complexity**: While some improvements, such as SimNorm, are novel, the inherent complexity and implementation hurdles might pose challenges for researchers looking to adopt the method quickly.

2. **Opportunity for Broader Evaluation**: Although detailed, the experiments mainly focus on continuous control tasks. Considering extensions to discrete or mixed-action spaces could enhance the paper even more.

3. **Insight on Scaling**: While the paper highlights scaling laws, a more in-depth theoretical exploration or formal justification could strengthen the understanding and generalization of these empirical observations.

Rating:
Overall, this paper provides substantial contributions to the reinforcement learning domain with technically sound results backed by rigorous experiments. The potential impacts are significant, especially in the development of generalist RL agents capable of complex, multivariate tasks. I rate this paper a 9/10, as it successfully meets its objectives, has practical applications, and is of interest to both academic and industry practitioners. However, potential complexity and scope for a slight extension in evaluation prevent a perfect score.

**Review of "TD-MPC 2: Scalable, Robust World Models for Continuous Control"**

**Summary:**

The paper presents TD-MPC 2, a model-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed for robust and scalable learning across a wide variety of continuous control tasks. The algorithm builds upon the previous TD-MPC framework with improvements that enhance empirical performance and robustness across multiple domains. The authors demonstrate that TD-MPC 2 can efficiently handle a large number of tasks without the need for hyperparameter tweaking, which is often a burden for RL methods. The paper includes extensive experiments across 104 tasks and shows superior performance compared to state-of-the-art model-free and model-based RL methods. The authors further include insights on the implications of their work and release resources for further research.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovation and Contribution:** The introduction of TD-MPC 2 with several algorithmic improvements makes it a notable advancement over its predecessor. The modifications in architecture, policy training, and robust handling of latent representations contribute significantly to the described performance gains.

2. **Experimental Rigor:** The paper includes a comprehensive set of experiments across diverse domains, showcasing the scalability and robustness of the method. Evaluating on 104 tasks from DMControl, Meta-World, ManiSkill2, and MyoSuite is impressive and provides strong empirical validation.

4. **Resource Sharing:** The authors commit to the open science community by releasing 300+ model checkpoints, datasets, and code, which is commendable and encourages further research and application.

5. **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written with clear explanations, helpful figures, and thorough appendices that provide additional insights into the design and results.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Discussion on Limitations:** While the paper mentions lessons, opportunities, and risks, it lacks a detailed discussion on limitations or failure cases of TD-MPC 2. Understanding these could help in further enhancing the algorithm.

2. **Generalization Claims:** Although the paper claims generalist behavior, the experiments are solely focused on continuous control tasks. Extending TD-MPC 2 to handle discrete action spaces or tasks outside the current benchmark remains unexplored.

3. **Ablation Studies:** The ablation studies are insightful, but they could be expanded to further explore the sensitivity of TD-MPC 2 to different hyperparameters or design choices in diverse settings.

4. **Comparison with Other Scalability Efforts:** The paper could benefit from a more in-depth comparison with other recent efforts in scalable RL beyond those considered in the experiments, especially in terms of computational efficiency and resource requirements.

**Rating: 9/10**

Overall, the paper makes a substantial contribution to the field of reinforcement learning, particularly in the scalability and robustness of model-based methods for continuous control. While there are areas for further exploration and improvement, the presented results and open-source resources establish TD-MPC 2 as a valuable tool for both academic research and practical applications in RL.
