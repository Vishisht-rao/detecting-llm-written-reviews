**Summary:**
The paper "Bilevel Optimization without Lower-Level Strong Convexity from the Hyper-Objective Perspective" addresses a challenging problem in bilevel optimization (BLO) scenarios where the lower-level problem lacks strong convexityâ€”a common assumption in traditional BLO methodologies. The authors present both hardness results demonstrating the intractability of BLO without lower-level strong convexity (LLSC) under general convex objectives and propose novel methods to identify regularity conditions that render such problems tractable. The paper specifically introduces the Inexact Gradient-Free Method (IGFM) leveraging the Switching Gradient Method (SGM) for efficient optimization under these conditions. The authors further substantiate the theoretical contributions with experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of their proposed frameworks.

**Strengths:**
1. **Theoretical Contributions:** The paper provides significant theoretical advancements by demonstrating the hardness of BLO without LLSC and introducing conditions under which these problems become tractable. The theoretical insights are robust and well-founded.

2. **Introduction of New Methods:** The introduction of IGFM and its demonstrated efficacy, especially when lower-level strong convexity is absent, is a compelling addition to the existing algorithms in the BLO landscape.

3. **Empirical Validation:** The numerical experiments, particularly in adversarial training and hyperparameter tuning, underscore the proposed methods' applicability and effectiveness. The results clearly show enhancements over baseline methods.

4. **Strong Motivation and Related Work:** The paper's structure is well-organized, and the literature review comprehensively covers relevant prior work, making it easy to understand the motivation behind and the context of the research.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Assumptions and Generality:** While the authors introduce novel regularity conditions that confer tractability, the practical applicability of these conditions across a broader range of problems can be questioned. It would be beneficial if the authors provided more extensive case studies or discussed limitations in applying these conditions.

2. **Experimental Evaluation:** Although the experiments are illustrative, a wider range of datasets and more extensive comparative studies involving different architectures and settings could enhance the empirical validation.

3. **Complexity Analysis Details:** The presentation of computational complexity and efficiency, particularly under assumed conditions, could benefit from further elaboration to appeal to practitioners interested in implementing the methods. More intuitive explanations could help demystify some of the mathematical rigor for readers who are less theoretical.

**Rating:** 8/10

**Conclusion:** This paper presents a well-founded and theoretically rich contribution to bilevel optimization, particularly where typical assumptions of the strong convexity of lower-level problems are not met. By addressing a significant gap in the existing literature and introducing new methodologies with proven efficacy, the work stands out as both impactful and promising. However, the experimental section could benefit from a wider scope and additional clarity. Overall, the paper merits a strong accept and should greatly interest the optimization and machine learning communities.

Title: Bilevel Optimization Without Lower-Level Strong Convexity from the Hyper-Objective Perspective

Review:

1. **Originality**: The paper addresses bilevel optimization problems where the lower-level (LL) functions lack strong convexity, a challenge that has not been thoroughly investigated. The authors claim this is a novel contribution as they provide hardness results for such problems and propose novel algorithms under specific regularity conditions. This aspect of the research is compelling and original as it fills a gap in the existing bilevel optimization literature.

2. **Technical Quality**: The technical depth of the paper is significant. The authors provide a solid foundation with theoretical proofs for their proposed methods, including sufficient ground for the algorithmic models. The introduction of the Inexact Gradient-Free Method (IGFM) and the Switching Gradient Method (SGM) as practical approaches and their convergence properties in polynomial time are well articulated and backed by theoretical insights.

3. **Clarity**: The paper is well-structured, with a comprehensive abstract that accurately reflects the contents of the paper. The notation and definitions provided are clear, and each section logically follows from the previous. However, given the advanced nature of the topic, the paper might be challenging for readers not well-versed in bilevel optimization and nonsmooth analysis. More intuitive explanations and potentially a section dedicated to practical implications might enhance accessibility.

4. **Significance**: The significance of the paper lies in its potential applications across multiple domains, including hyperparameter tuning, neural architecture search, and meta-learning. By addressing the intractability under conditions of weak LL convexity, the proposed methods could be of great utility to researchers and practitioners in optimizing complex machine learning models.

5. **Empirical Evaluation**: The paper reports numerical experiments on adversarial training and hyperparameter tuning, showcasing the efficacy of the proposed methods. While these experiments demonstrate the applicability and performance relative to existing approaches, they could benefit from more comprehensive benchmarking against broader datasets or more varied machine learning tasks.

6. **Limitations and Further Work**: One potential limitation is that the proposed algorithms might still be computationally intensive due to the nature of bilevel optimization. While some cases of practical convergence are presented, the scalability to very large or highly complex models isn't fully explored. Future work could focus on improving the efficiency further or extending their applicability to nonconvex LL functions.

Overall, the paper presents a well-rounded contribution with a sound theoretical foundation for optimizing bilevel problems without lower-level strong convexity. The combination of theoretical insights, algorithm design, and empirical validation makes a valuable addition to the field.

Rating: 8/10

This rating reflects the novel contributions and theoretical rigor of the paper, balanced against the potential gaps in practical accessibility and broader empirical validation.
