Review:

The paper "PROTO: Iterative Policy Regularized Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning" presents a novel framework called PROTO, which aims to address the suboptimal performance, limited adaptability, and computational inefficiency seen in existing offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) methods. The approach augments the standard RL objective with an iteratively evolving regularization term, combining the stability of trust-region-style updates with flexibility in constraints, paving the way for adaptable and efficient policy finetuning.

The strengths of the paper are as follows:

1. **Innovative Approach**: The paper introduces a new iterative regularization technique that effectively balances stability and optimality during the finetuning process. This represents a significant advancement over prior methods that often suffer from suboptimality due to fixed policy constraints.

2. **Empirical Validation**: The extensive experiments on a variety of benchmarks — MuJoCo, AntMaze, and Adroit tasks with D4RL datasets — demonstrate the superiority of PROTO over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The empirical results convincingly show that PROTO achieves stable initial tuning and superior policy performance.

3. **Theoretical Insights**: The authors provide theoretical insights into why iterative policy regularization outperforms both fixed regularization and no regularization approaches. The proofs and lemmas extend the understanding of KL-regularized MDPs in the offline-to-online RL setting.

4. **Adaptability and Efficiency**: The proposed framework is adaptable to diverse offline pretraining and online finetuning methods, showcasing its versatility. Additionally, it imposes minimal extra computation, retaining high efficiency, a key factor for practical deployment.

5. **Comprehensive Analysis**: The paper includes thorough ablation studies and comparisons that elucidate the impact of various hyperparameters and design choices, adding robustness to the claims made.

However, there are a few areas where the paper could be slightly improved:

1. **Complexity of Explanation**: Some sections, particularly those involving theoretical analysis, are dense and may present a steep learning curve for readers not deeply familiar with the subject. Additional intuitive explanations or visual aids could further enhance understanding.

2. **Broader Impact Discussion**: While the paper discusses the advantages and future potential of PROTO, a discussion on limitations and possible negative societal impacts would provide a more balanced view.

Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of offline-to-online RL. The novelty of the method, coupled with its strong empirical performance and theoretical grounding, make it a valuable addition to the conference. The work stands out as both practical and innovative, warranting a high rating.

Title: PROTO: Iterative Policy Regularized Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning

Summary:
The paper proposes a new framework, PROTO, for offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL). Offline-to-online RL aims to leverage offline pretraining to achieve better online RL performance and sample efficiency. The existing methods face challenges like suboptimality, limited adaptability, and computational inefficiency. PROTO addresses these by incorporating an iteratively evolving regularization term into the standard RL objective, allowing for trust-region-style updates. This iterative approach diminishes the constraint strength progressively, presumably making it more adaptable and computationally efficient.

Key Contributions:
1. Introduction of PROTO, which augments standard RL objectives with iteratively evolving regularization.
2. The method offers adaptability to various offline pretraining and online RL fine-tuning methods with minimal extra computational overhead.
3. Theoretical analysis suggests PROTO reduces approximation error accumulation, offering stability and optimal convergence.
4. Experiments demonstrate superior performance against many state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines on multiple benchmarks, notably on D4RL datasets.

Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a crucial problem in reinforcement learning by merging the benefits of offline and online methods.
2. PROTO seems to efficiently bridge different offline and online techniques, demonstrated by its adaptability and minimal code changes.
3. The paper dives into theoretical guarantees, providing a level of robustness and explanation for the observed empirical performance.
4. Comprehensive experiments across various tasks and comparisons with strong baselines show the framework's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. While the paper boasts theoretical analysis, the details are confined to the appendix and might lack depth regarding practical implementation challenges.
2. Comparisons with baselines use several concurrent works where detailed hyperparameter settings might alter results' interpretation.
3. The framework requires settings' adjustments like Polyak averaging speed and conservatism annealing, which might obscure straightforward adaptability claims.

Score: 8/10

Overall, the paper offers considerable innovation in iterative policy regularization for offline-to-online RL, supported by strong empirical demonstrations. The balance between theoretical justification and practical performance is commendable, although some aspects such as hyperparameter sensitivity and comprehensive comparison specifics could be more transparent. With minor refinements, the framework seems to set a promising direction for advancing RL techniques.
