Title: Investigating Human-Identifiable Features Hidden in Adversarial Perturbations

Rating: 8/10

Review:

This paper delves into the intriguing and complex field of adversarial perturbations in neural networks, specifically exploring the presence and role of human-identifiable features within these perturbations. The authors present a comprehensive study that covers multiple attack algorithms, datasets, and models, offering significant insights into the nature of adversarial attacks.

Strengths:

1. **Novel Insights**: The paper provides a fresh perspective by exploring human-identifiable features within adversarial perturbations, an aspect that is not thoroughly covered in existing literature. This could be pivotal in understanding the mechanics of adversarial attacks and developing more robust defense strategies.

2. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The authors conduct extensive experiments using various datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet) and multiple attack algorithms, increasing the robustness and validity of their findings. The experiments are well-designed to validate the presence of human-identifiable features and distinguish between the masking and generation effects.

3. **Methodology**: The approach of averaging perturbations across different models to reveal hidden features is both innovative and methodologically sound. It effectively minimizes noise and consolidates incomplete feature information, illuminating the underlying patterns in adversarial perturbations.

4. **Practical Implications**: By identifying the role of human-identifiable features in adversarial attacks, the paper offers potential pathways to improve adversarial defenses, transferability understanding, and model interpretability.

5. **Clear Explanations**: The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of complex concepts and detailed descriptions of the experimental setup and results.

Weaknesses:

1. **Complexity of Assumptions**: While the assumptions made in the study are logical, some of them, especially regarding the inherent nature of human-identifiable features in perturbations, might benefit from additional theoretical backing or exploration.

2. **Generality of Findings**: Although the findings are significant, it is not entirely clear how they generalize across all types of neural network architectures and datasets. Further exploration in real-world scenarios could strengthen the applicability of the results.

3. **Limited Human Study**: The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive human evaluation study to better quantify and validate the recognizability of adversarial perturbations by non-experts.

4. **Reproducibility**: While the paper provides considerable detail, additional information on the computational resources and specific configurations of the models used could enhance reproducibility.

In summary, this paper makes a substantial contribution to the field by highlighting a crucial aspect of adversarial perturbations that has been overlooked. It opens up new avenues for research and application in adversarial learning and defense strategies. However, some areas could be further strengthened, particularly in terms of theoretical grounding and practical generalization. Due to its novel insights and potential applications, it deserves a strong rating of 8/10.

Title: Investigating Human-Identifiable Features Hidden in Adversarial Perturbations

Summary: This paper explores the presence of human-identifiable features within adversarial perturbations in neural networks. By employing up to five attack algorithms on three datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet), the study identifies two distinct effects—masking and generation—that manifest within these perturbations. It introduces a methodology based on averaging perturbations from different neural networks to reveal these hidden features. The paper additionally examines the implications of these findings on adversarial transferability, model interpretability, and robustness.

Strengths:
1. **Novelty**: The paper introduces an interesting and novel approach to uncover human-identifiable features in adversarial perturbations, which could help bridge the gap between observed adversarial effects and human intuition.
2. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The authors use a variety of datasets and attack algorithms, providing a broad understanding of how human-identifiable features differ by attack type and dataset.
3. **Detailed Analysis**: The integration of noise reduction techniques and the extensive evaluation of different conditions (SM and MM+G settings) demonstrate a thorough investigation into the effects of various factors on the visibility of human-identifiable features.
4. **Impactful Insight**: The study offers an important perspective on how adversarial perturbations can include recognizable features, potentially aiding the development of more robust neural networks.

Weaknesses:
1. **Clarity and Organization**: The paper is quite dense and at times difficult to follow. The organization and presentation of results could be improved to make the paper more accessible.
2. **Overreliance on Visual Inspection**: While the paper provides visual evidence of the masking and generation effects, there is a heavy reliance on qualitative assessments which might be subjective. Incorporating more quantitative measures for feature recognition could strengthen the analysis.
3. **Generality**: The applicability of the findings beyond the selected datasets and models is not fully addressed. More discussion on how these insights could generalize to other models or applications could enhance the paper's impact.
4. **Computational Demand**: The methods suggested, particularly those involving averaging hundreds of models, are computationally intense, which may limit their practical applicability.

Rating: 6/10

Rationale: The paper presents innovative insights that contribute significantly to the field of adversarial machine learning, particularly in understanding adversarial perturbations through the lens of human-identifiable features. However, the presentation could be clearer, and the practical utility of the findings might be limited due to computational constraints. The reliance on visual inspection as a primary evidence form, without robust quantification, also detracts slightly from the rigor of the evaluation. Improving these aspects could significantly enhance the paper's quality and impact.
