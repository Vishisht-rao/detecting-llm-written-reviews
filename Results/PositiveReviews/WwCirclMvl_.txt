**Review:**

The paper presents a novel and rigorous approach to offline reinforcement learning (RL) by employing posterior sampling via Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC). This study primarily addresses the gap in existing literature, where posterior sampling has not been extensively used in offline RL due to its explorative nature which is typically considered unsuited for offline settings without online data. The authors propose a framework called pessimistic posterior sampling (PPS) and adapt it for offline RL by leveraging LMC to approximate posterior distributions.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Approach:** The introduction of Langevin Monte Carlo into offline reinforcement learning is a substantial innovation. This approach addresses the computational challenges that previous posterior sampling methods faced, especially in high dimensions.

2. **Theoretical Contributions:** The paper provides comprehensive theoretical analysis and bounds for the proposed methods. The authors derive frequentist sub-optimality bounds for both linear MDPs and general MDPs with overparameterized neural network function approximations.

3. **Empirical Validation:** The paper supports its theoretical findings with empirical evaluations. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods are competitive and efficient, highlighting their potential applicability to real-world high-dimensional offline RL tasks.

4. **Clear Exposition:** Despite the technical complexity, the paper does a good job of structuring and explaining the methods and results, making it accessible to readers familiar with reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo methods.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity of Techniques:** The proposed framework is heavily technical, which might limit its immediate applicability and straightforward implementation by practitioners not deeply versed in both MCMC methods and the intricacies of offline RL.

2. **Limited Practical Demonstrations:** While the empirical results are promising, expanding the experiments to more complex real-world scenarios would strengthen the paper’s impact and validate its applicability beyond simulated environments.

3. **Theoretical Gaps:** The authors themselves mention a gap in the worst-case scenario bounds and the fact that the approach does not yet match the optimal bounds achieved by some maximum likelihood methods under similar settings.

Overall, this paper presents a significant advancement in the field of offline reinforcement learning. It successfully introduces a sophisticated solution to a complex problem, backed by a solid theoretical framework and meaningful experimental results. However, further iterative experiments in more applied contexts and addressing the noted theoretical gaps would enhance its contribution. This paper deserves a strong consideration for acceptance given its deep theoretical insights and innovative approach to tackling offline RL challenges.

**Title:** Posterior Sampling via Langevin Monte Carlo for Offline Reinforcement Learning

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel framework for offline reinforcement learning (RL) that employs Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) methods for posterior sampling. The key contributions are the introduction of Pessimistic Posterior Sampling (PPS), a generic posterior sampling framework that incorporates pessimism by taking multiple samples from the posterior distribution, and an adaptation of LMC to simulate these samples. The approach is analyzed both in the context of linear low-rank Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and more general MDPs using neural networks for function approximation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the efficiency and competitiveness of the proposed LMC-based algorithms.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Contribution:** The paper addresses the lack of tractable, sample-efficient posterior sampling methods in offline RL by leveraging LMC, filling a significant gap in the literature.
  
2. **Theoretical Guarantees:** The authors provide solid theoretical analysis, deriving sub-optimality bounds for the proposed approach. This strengthens the credibility of their method.

3. **Empirical Validation:** The paper includes comprehensive experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the LMC-based PPS method compared to other state-of-the-art techniques, such as GreedyVI, PEVI, and exact Thompson sampling.

4. **Clarity of Writing:** Despite the complex mathematical content, the paper maintains a clear structure and explanation, making the contributions accessible to a readership familiar with the subject.

5. **Relevance:** Offline RL is an important area with applications in domains where exploration is risky or expensive (e.g., healthcare, robotics), making this work timely and impactful.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity and Stability Concerns:** While the paper argues that Langevin dynamics can provide efficient posterior sampling, the computational complexity and numerical stability of LMC in high-dimensional settings might pose challenges that need more detailed exploration.

2. **Empirical Comparison Scope:** Although the experiments are well-conducted, the diversity of evaluated domains could be broadened to strengthen claims about the method’s general applicability.

3. **Assumption Restrictions:** The assumptions for theoretical results, especially those concerning neural tangent kernels and overparameterization, may limit practical applicability and should be further discussed in terms of real-world scenarios.

4. **Interplay with Exact Posterior Sampling:** The discussion around the comparative computational benefits of approximate versus exact posterior sampling could be more detailed, with examples or more empirical evaluations specifically focused on this comparison.

**Rating: 8/10**

**Conclusion:**
This paper presents a meaningful advancement for offline RL by introducing posterior sampling via LMC, backed by rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluation. Though there are minor concerns regarding computational complexity and empirical scope, the paper's contributions are noteworthy and constitute a significant step forward in combining posterior sampling methods with offline reinforcement learning paradigms. The insightful integration of LMC for this purpose and the groundwork laid for future exploration render this paper deserving of a strong accept recommendation.
