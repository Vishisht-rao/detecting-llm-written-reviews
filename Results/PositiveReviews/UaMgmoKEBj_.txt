Title: Decoupling Regularization from the Action Space

Rating: 9/10

Review:

The paper, "Decoupling Regularization from the Action Space," addresses a critical problem within the realm of reinforcement learning (RL): the susceptibility of regularized RL methods to changes in the action space. The authors propose a novel approach to decouple the regularizer from the action space to maintain a consistent level of regularization, thereby avoiding over-regularization, especially in cases of state-dependent action spaces.

Key Strengths:

1. **Innovative Problem Identification**: The authors start by identifying a neglected issue in regularized reinforcement learning—how changes in the action space can adversely impact the regularization process. This is an important problem that has not received sufficient attention in the community.

2. **Theoretical Contribution**: The paper presents a thorough theoretical analysis, introducing the concept of "decoupled regularizers." This idea is clearly defined and rigorously justified, offering a formalism that fits within the existing framework of regularized MDPs.

3. **Practical Solutions**: Two practical solutions are proposed: a static temperature selection approach and a dynamic temperature heuristic. Both methods are elegant in their simplicity and applicability across various regularized MDPs, broadening the utility of this research.

4. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The implementation of the proposed changes is well-evaluated through empirical experimentation on a range of benchmarks, including the DeepMind control suite and a biological sequence design task. The experiments demonstrate improved performance, underscoring the relevance and effectiveness of the approach.

5. **Clarity and Organization**: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with each section logically feeding into the next. The use of examples and illustrative figures helps in better understanding the implications of the proposed methods.

Areas for Improvement:

1. **Extended Discussion on Limitations**: While the method is presented as broadly applicable, a more in-depth discussion regarding its limitations or potential edge cases would strengthen the work and guide future research directions.

2. **Comparison with More Baselines**: Additional experimental comparisons with a wider variety of existing regularization strategies in RL could further solidify the claims of superiority.

3. **Potential for Real-World Applications**: While the paper mainly focuses on theoretical extensions and controlled experimental settings, discussing potential real-world applications could enhance its impact.

Conclusion:

The paper addresses a critical and largely overlooked issue in regularized RL with a novel and theoretically sound approach. The solutions proposed are both practical and broadly applicable, as demonstrated by thorough empirical evaluation. The work is a significant step towards making regularized RL more robust to changes in action space. With some extension in its comparative evaluation and discussion, this research has the potential to influence future work significantly.

Overall, the paper makes a substantial contribution to the field of reinforcement learning, warranting a strong acceptance.

Title: DECOUPLING REGULARIZATION FROM THE ACTION SPACE

Rating: 7/10

Summary:
The paper addresses the issue of over-regularization in regularized reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks, particularly in entropy-regularized RL, due to variations in the action space. It argues that the extent of regularization should remain consistent regardless of the action space size and introduces a method to decouple the regularizer from the action space by adjusting the temperature parameter. The authors present a static and a dynamic temperature selection approach to achieve this decoupling, demonstrating improved performance on benchmark tasks from the DeepMind control suite and a biological sequence design task.

Strengths:
1. **Novelty and Contribution**: The paper presents a well-articulated and relevant problem in regularized RL and proposes a promising solution. The introduction of decoupled regularizers adds a new dimension to the regularization techniques in RL.

2. **Implementation and Experiments**: The authors provide thorough experimentation, comparing both static and dynamic temperature adjustments across various benchmarks, including DeepMind Control Suite and a challenging drug design task. The empirical results substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

3. **Clarity**: The paper is generally well-structured and clearly written. Key ideas such as the affect of action space on regularization are explained with sufficient detail and intuitiveness, making the paper accessible even to those who may not be deeply familiar with the intricacies of RL.

4. **Mathematical Rigor**: The proposed solutions are backed by strong theoretical foundations. The lemmas and theorems are well-presented and provide a solid basis for understanding why decoupling the regularizer leads to the claimed benefits.

Weaknesses:
1. **Generality vs. Specificity**: While the paper opens up new directions in handling regularization across varying action spaces, some of the concepts (e.g., decoupling through the range of the regularizer) might not generalize easily to all forms of regularization, particularly those that have non-standard formulations.

2. **Real-World Applicability**: The benchmarks used, although challenging, may not fully capture the complexity seen in real-world applications. More diverse and large-scale environments could strengthen the claim of wide applicability of the presented methods.

3. **Dynamic Temperature Adjustment**: The explanation and framing around dynamic temperature adjustment (particularly the choice of parameter α) could be more comprehensive. An extended discussion on how to tune this parameter in practice and its implications across varying tasks is warranted.

4. **Lack of Consideration for Non-Standard Regularizers**: The paper primarily focuses on entropy or closely related formulations. Addressing how other regularizers that do not fall into the 'standard' category could be adapted would enhance the paper's scope.

Concluding Remarks:
The paper presents a valuable contribution to regularized RL by decoupling the regularizer from action space influences. It is recommended for acceptance with the caveat of further exploring its constraints and testing in more real-world-like scenarios. The work holds potential for implementation across a range of RL applications and prompts further research into adaptive regularization techniques, making it an excellent candidate for a conference like ICLR.
