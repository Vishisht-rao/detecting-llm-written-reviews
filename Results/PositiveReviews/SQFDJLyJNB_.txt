**Review of "Prompt CCD: Learning Gaussian Mixture Prompt Pool for Continual Category Discovery"**

**Rating: 9/10**

**Summary:**

The paper introduces a novel approach, PromptCCD, to address the challenging open-world learning problem of continual category discovery (CCD). CCD requires models to learn from a labeled dataset with known categories and continuously adapt to an unlabelled data stream that might introduce novel categories. The authors propose using the Gaussian Mixture Prompt Module (GMP) at the core of PromptCCD to facilitate this process. The GMP acts as a dynamic pool updating over time, preventing catastrophic forgetting and enabling on-the-fly estimation of category numbers. The paper demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods through extensive experiments across various datasets.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Approach:** The concept of using Gaussian Mixture Models as a prompting method to dynamically guide models in CCD is innovative and seems to be effective in tackling the catastrophic forgetting problem.

2. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The paper provides extensive experimental results on multiple datasets, clearly showing the superiority of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art methods in different scenarios, including the more realistic one where the number of categories is unknown.

3. **Robustness and Scalability:** The method's ability to dynamically estimate unknown category numbers and its flexibility in adapting to various CCD settings (e.g., with different class split ratios) highlights its potential applicability in real-world scenarios.

4. **Clarity and Depth:** The paper is well-structured, with detailed descriptions of the methodology, algorithms, and experiments. The inclusion of various ablation studies adds depth to the findings and provides insights into the importance of specific components of the model.

5. **Open-World Realism:** The focus on an open-world learning problem by enabling models to learn continually from unlabelled data without catastrophic forgetting underlines the relevance and timeliness of the research topic.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity in Implementation:** While the proposed approach shows promising results, the implementation and integration of GMP into existing models could be complex. Additional guidance or pseudo-code would further assist in practical replication and adoption.

2. **Baseline Comparisons:** Although the paper does a fair job at comparing its method with existing approaches, slightly more discussion on the limitations or challenges faced by related methods would provide a richer context.

3. **Long-term Stability:** The paper does not address potential challenges that may arise with long-term learning in CCD settings. Issues such as error accumulation and model drift over prolonged periods might need further exploration.

**Conclusion:**

This paper presents a cutting-edge approach to a critical problem in the field of machine learning. With a few minor improvements regarding the practical implementation guidance and acknowledging potential long-term learning challenges, the paper would score even higher. Nonetheless, PromptCCD represents an exciting advancement in CCD and open-world learning scenarios, positioning the authors' work as an influential contribution to the domain.

Title: PromptCCD: Learning Gaussian Mixture Prompt Pool for Continual Category Discovery

**Summary:**
The paper introduces PromptCCD, a novel framework for tackling the task of Continual Category Discovery (CCD). The task is complex as it involves discovering new categories from an incoming stream of unlabelled data while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previously learned categories. The authors propose a Gaussian Mixture Prompt Module (GMP) that leverages Gaussian mixture models to dynamically generate prompts facilitating category discovery and knowledge retention. The framework outperforms existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Approach:** The use of Gaussian mixture models as a prompt mechanism is a novel approach to the problem of continual learning and category discovery. This adds an innovative angle to handling the dual challenge of learning new categories without forgetting old ones.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The framework is empirically tested on a variety of datasets, including both coarse and fine-grained datasets, showing robustness across different data distributions. The authors provide thorough experimental results in both known and unknown class settings.

3. **Dynamic Estimation of Classes:** The proposed method can estimate the number of categories on-the-fly, which is highly relevant for real-world applications where the exact number of classes is not predetermined.

4. **Detailed Analysis:** The paper includes extensive ablation studies and additionally visualizes results that help interpret the quality of learned representations and the effectiveness of the GMP module.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Clarity and Presentation:** Although the paper covers a range of experiments, the text is occasionally dense and hard to parse, especially for readers not intimately familiar with the CCD literature. Some figures and descriptions may benefit from simplification and clarification.

2. **Comparison with Directly Related Works:** While the authors compare their work against existing state-of-the-art methods, there seems to be some room for a more direct comparison with methods that also use similar unsupervised or semi-supervised techniques for knowledge retention and discovery.

3. **Scalability Concerns:** The paper doesn't sufficiently discuss the computational costs and scalability of the approach, especially as it relates to the retraining of Gaussian mixtures at each step.

4. **Limited Real-World Scenario Discussion:** While the method shows strong performance in established benchmarks, there could be further discussion on how this approach would adapt to complexities in real-world scenarios with potentially more noisy or extremely imbalanced data.

**Rating:** 7/10

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a promising and novel approach to CCD that contributes to advancing the state of continual learning. The combination of conceptual novelty and strong empirical results warrants interest from the research community. However, improvements in clarity and additional explorations on scalability and real-world generalization could enhance its impact and applicability.
