Title: Deepfake Detection with Contrastive Learning in Curved Spaces

Rating: 9/10

Review:

1. **Originality and Novelty (10/10)**:
   - The paper presents a novel approach named CTru, which uniquely employs contrastive learning in curved spaces (specifically hyperspherical and hyperbolic) for deepfake detection. The idea of leveraging multiple-curvature spaces to learn facial geometry and detect anomalies is highly original and innovative. This approach stands out as it challenges the traditional reliance on Euclidean geometry in deepfake detection tasks.

2. **Technical Quality (9/10)**:
   - The methodology is technically sound and well-explained. The use of hyperbolic spaces to capture semantic similarities and the integration of multi-curvature space learning provide a robust framework for detecting deepfakes. The paper demonstrates strong theoretical foundations and offers comprehensive experimental evaluations. The inclusion of the Busemann function in hyperbolic space and the novel fakeness scoring method are technical strengths.

3. **Clarity and Presentation (8/10)**:
   - The paper is generally well-written, with clear explanations of complex concepts, which makes it accessible. However, the paper is dense and could benefit from additional illustrations, particularly in explaining the geometric intuitions behind the manifold learning. Some sections, like the appendices, might require further expansion to aid understanding, especially for readers less familiar with differential geometry.

4. **Experimental Validation (9/10)**:
   - The experiments are comprehensive, with CTru achieving state-of-the-art results on various challenging datasets. The cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations provide strong evidence for the model's superior generalization capabilities. The robustness tests further demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach under various perturbations.

5. **Relevance and Impact (9/10)**:
   - Given the growing threat of deepfakes, CTru's robust detection capabilities highlight significant contributions to both academia and industry. Its ability to generalize from pristine data without relying on prior knowledge of fake image distributions suggests broad applicability and potential impact in real-world scenarios.

6. **Overall Assessment**:
   - CTru represents a significant advancement in the field of deepfake detection with its innovative use of contrastive learning in curved spaces. The paper successfully combines theoretical advancements with practical applicability, offering a new perspective on anomaly detection in facial data. While there are minor areas for improvement in presentation clarity, the contribution's overall strength justifies a strong recommendation for acceptance.

In conclusion, this paper's originality, technical rigor, and experimental validation make it a valuable addition to the conference, deserving a high rating.

### Review of "DEEPFAKE DETECTION WITH CONTRASTIVE LEARNING IN CURVED SPACES"

#### Summary
The paper presents a novel method called CTru for deepfake detection using contrastive learning in spaces with different curvatures, specifically hypersphere and hyperbolic spaces. The authors argue that the human face manifold is non-Euclidean and propose leveraging the geometric properties of curved spaces to improve feature representation and anomaly detection. The method utilizes self-supervised learning to train on pristine faces and evaluate using a "fakeness" score based on model confidence and similarity measures. The experimental results suggest that CTru establishes new state-of-the-art performances in both cross-dataset and cross-manipulation deepfake detection scenarios.

#### Strengths
1. **Innovative Approach**: The use of multi-curvature spaces for deepfake detection is an innovative idea that explores geometry beyond conventional Euclidean spaces, which is a fresh perspective in this domain.
  
2. **Self-Supervised Learning**: The method does not rely on deepfake examples during training, which enhances its applicability and robustness across different datasets.

3. **Strong Experimental Results**: CTru demonstrates impressive results on various challenging datasets, outperforming many state-of-the-art methods, which highlights its generalization capacity.

4. **Theoretical Insight**: The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation, explaining the choice of hypersphere and hyperbolic spaces and their benefits in capturing facial geometry.

5. **Comprehensive Ablation Study**: Detailed experiments are conducted to justify the contributions of different components of the model, which strengthens the claims of the paper.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Complexity and Clarity**: The paper is dense with technical details, which might be challenging to digest for readers not deeply familiar with geometric representation learning. While the ideas are innovative, the presentation could be streamlined for better clarity.

2. **Limited Evaluation Metrics**: The evaluation is largely based on AUC, and other metrics such as precision, recall, or F1-score could provide a more comprehensive view of the model's performance.

3. **Feature Interpretability**: While the method achieves strong results, there could be more discussion on the interpretability of the learned features in curved spaces, especially regarding the specific challenges posed by various deepfake techniques.

4. **Lack of Broader Context**: The broader implications and potential ethical considerations of deepfake detection using such advanced methods could be discussed more thoroughly.

5. **Dataset Limitation**: The discussion lacks diversity in datasets for training, focusing primarily on FaceForensics++, which, although a standard choice, might not cover the full spectrum of deepfake generation techniques.

#### Rating
Overall, the paper has strong merits in terms of its novel approach and empirical results, though it could benefit from improved clarity and broader context regarding its real-world implications. I would rate this paper an 8/10. It represents a significant advancement in the field but requires some improvements in presentation and comprehensive evaluation.
