**Review of "GENERALIZABLE DEEP RL-BASED TSP SOLVER VIA APPROXIMATE INVARIANCE"**

**Rating: 7/10**

**Summary:**
This paper presents a novel approach to solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with an emphasis on generalizability via approximate invariance. The proposed method, TS3, incorporates a Transformer-based model trained with a modified policy gradient algorithm and data augmentation techniques. The approach aims to improve the solver's ability to generalize to larger TSP instances than those seen during training, which is a notable challenge in current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Additionally, the paper introduces TS4, which combines TS3 with Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to further validate its capabilities.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach:** The paper introduces a novel method for enhancing the generalization ability of DRL-based TSP solvers by leveraging approximate invariance and data augmentation, which is an interesting and creative direction.
2. **Comprehensive Empirical Evaluation:** The paper includes a thorough experimental evaluation on both randomly generated TSP instances and benchmark instances from the TSPLIB library. The results demonstrate improved performance in generalizing to larger instances compared to other SOTA methods.
3. **Technical Contributions:** The integration of a local view via k-nearest neighbors and a global view in the Transformer-based model is a promising architectural choice that helps mitigate the complexity associated with large-sized instances.
4. **Combination with MCTS:** The proposal of TS4 to combine the learned model with MCTS is a valuable addition that highlights the potential for DRL approaches to be used in conjunction with traditional search methods for enhanced performance.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Clarity and Organization:** While the paper is technically rich, it could benefit from clearer explanations and organization. Some sections, particularly those describing the architecture and algorithms, would benefit from more concise and structured descriptions to improve readability.
2. **Comparison with SOTA:** Although the paper compares the proposed method against several baselines, the presentation of results could be better organized to highlight the specific advantages of TS3 in different TSP scenarios and against all competing methods.
3. **Scalability:** While the method shows promise in generalizing to larger instances, the paper does not adequately address the scalability concerns of the approach, particularly in terms of computational overhead and memory usage as the instance size increases significantly.
4. **Limited Theoretical Insights:** The paper focuses heavily on empirical results, whereas a deeper theoretical analysis of why approximate invariances contribute to better generalization in TSP would strengthen the contributions of the work.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents an intriguing method that addresses a significant challenge in the application of DRL to TSP, namely generalizability to larger instances. While the approach is innovative and the results are promising, improvements in presentation, organization, and theoretical discussion would enhance the impact and clarity of the work. Given these considerations, I recommend the paper for acceptance with a rating of 7/10, acknowledging its contributions and potential for further development.

OUTPUT:
The paper presented proposes a new approach for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a model named TS3. The model is designed to improve generalization to large-sized instances by leveraging approximate invariance principles. The authors introduced a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates both local and global views of TSP instances and demonstrated the efficacy of their model through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets.

### Strengths

1. **Novel Approach**: The paper proposes a novel way of enforcing approximate invariance by integrating local and global views in the DRL framework, which is applicable to the TSP.
   
2. **Transformer-based Architecture**: Leveraging the power of transformers is a solid design choice given their success in varied domains.

3. **Generalization Focus**: The paper's focus on improving generalization to TSP instances larger than those seen during training is noteworthy and addresses a well-known challenge in machine learning models applied to combinatorial problems.

4. **Combining MCTS**: The authors attempt to combine DRL with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to further enhance their model, which is an interesting enhancement.

5. **Abundant Results**: The empirical part is well-covered with comparisons against a variety of existing methods, showing competitive performances especially for large instances, and the authors provide an ablative study.

### Weaknesses

1. **Clarity and Structure**: The paper could benefit from clearer explanations and a better-organized detailed description. Some sections, especially the methodology, are likely too dense and could use further clarity.

2. **Comparative Results**: While the quantitative results are promising, a clearer discussion about why the TS3 performs better or worse compared to certain baselines in certain scenarios is missing. The absence of interpretability discussions around empirical results makes it hard to discern qualitative insights.

3. **Scalability Discussion**: There is inadequate discussion addressing the computational scalability and training costs associated with the proposed models beyond raw numbers.

4. **Literature Contextualization**: The paper could improve by elaborating on how it integrates with or extends previous work. The Related Works section, while diverse, could connect more deeply with the proposed work.

5. **Algorithm Pseudocode**: While pseudocode is provided, deeper integration of the pseudo-algorithm within the main body in a simplified manner could aid comprehension.

### Rating: 6/10

Overall, the paper presents innovative ideas and performs extensive experiments that demonstrate strong potential for state-of-the-art performance, particularly on larger TSP instances. However, enhancements in clarity, structure, and provision of deeper analysis and discussion around the results will be necessary to strongly recommend acceptance.
