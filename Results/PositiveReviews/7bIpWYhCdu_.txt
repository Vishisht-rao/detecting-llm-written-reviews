Title: FILI: SYNTAX REPAIR BY LEARNING FROM OWN MISTAKES

**Review:**

The paper introduces FILI, a self-learning approach for syntax error correction in programs without needing an additional breaker model for data augmentation. The proposed method addresses a significant challenge in automated program repair, offering an unsupervised way to improve a syntax fixer by leveraging its own mistakes, and incorporating curriculum learning to increase the complexity of training examples over time. This novel approach effectively builds upon prior work, such as BIFI, by simplifying the training process and improving performance.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Significance**: The paper presents a novel method (FILI) that simplifies the data augmentation step by avoiding the need for separate breaker model and instead, relies on the fixer's errors. This approach is both innovative and impactful in reducing training complexity and computational resources required.

2. **Performance**: The empirical results on the Github-Python dataset demonstrate that FILI outperforms the current state-of-the-art method, BIFI, with a 1% improvement in accuracy while being computationally more efficient.

3. **Efficiency**: By not requiring an additional model and utilizing a curriculum learning approach, FILI expedites the training process, reducing the need for extensive computational resources as evidenced by cutting down the 2 days training time needed for BIFI's breaker model.

4. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The evaluation includes comparisons to both BIFI and large language models (PaLM-2 and GPT-3.5-turbo), providing a comprehensive analysis of FILI's effectiveness.

5. **Clear Motivation and Contributions**: The paper presents clear motivations, outlining the challenges with existing methods and effectively communicating the key contributions of FILI, which is likely to be beneficial for academic and industry practitioners interested in automated error correction.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Dataset**: The paper evaluates only on the Github-Python dataset. It would be beneficial to see how FILI performs on other datasets, for broader validation of the approach.

2. **Detailed Analysis of Curriculum Learning**: While the curriculum learning approach is intriguing, further analysis and evidence supporting the choice of edit-distance thresholds could strengthen the claims.

3. **Complexity of Error Types**: There could be more analysis on the complexity and types of errors FILI effectively addresses compared to prior methods, which could provide deeper insights into the model's robustness.

**Rating: 9/10**

Overall, this paper makes a substantial contribution to the field of automated program repair with its innovative approach to unsupervised learning for syntax error correction. The simplification of the learning process and promising results justify a strong acceptance, though further experimentation and analysis could enhance its robustness and applicability across more diverse contexts.

Title: FILI: Syntax Repair by Learning from Own Mistakes

Abstract and Introduction:
The authors introduce FILI (Fix-It-Learn-It), a novel approach for automatically fixing syntax errors in programs. The introduction is comprehensive, adequately setting the stage for the problem background, including a detailed explanation of existing solutions like BIFI. The motivation behind FILI is clear, identifying the significant challenge of needing paired datasets for syntax error correction. The introduction nicely outlines the limitations of current rule-based and learning-based approaches and justifies the need for an improved method.

Methodology:
The FILI methodology is innovative in that it uses the model's own mistakes for iteratively improving syntax error correction. This approach negates the need for an additional breaker model used in BIFI, significantly simplifying the training process. Additionally, adopting a curriculum learning approach to gradually increase the complexity of training examples is a thoughtful enhancement, aligned with real-world programmer learning behavior.

The paper effectively contrasts FILI with the BIFI approach, providing a clear understanding of the differences and improvements, such as the elimination of the breaker model and the emphasis on learning from mistakes. The detailed step-by-step explanation of the FILI process is helpful and allows the reader to follow the logic easily.

Experiments and Evaluation:
The experimental section is robust, with evaluations on the Github-Python dataset, which is a suitable choice for this research. The authors present a compelling case for FILI's superiority over BIFI by demonstrating higher accuracy rates and computational efficiency. The results are presented in a manner that is easy to interpret, with tables that effectively compare different configurations of FILI and BIFI.

The comparison with large language models like GPT-3.5 turbo and PaLM-2 is a valuable addition, showing that FILI outperforms these models in certain evaluation metrics. This lends further credibility to the practical implications of FILI as a viable solution in settings with limited computational resources.

Ablation studies provide further insights into the specific contributions of curriculum learning and highlight the importance of the chosen evaluation metric. The authors also offer a qualitative analysis of fixes, adding depth to the analysis of FILI's effectiveness.

Discussion and Contributions:
The authors do a good job outlining the key contributions of this research, notably simplifying the training procedure for syntax fixers and providing empirical evidence of improved performance. The discussion section appropriately addresses the limitations of existing methods and how FILI overcomes these, thus reinforcing the significance of their contributions.

Writing Quality:
Overall, the paper is well-written, with clear explanations and logical flow. The methodology and results are presented coherently, allowing readers to grasp the technical details and the implications of the findings. Citations to relevant prior work are thoughtfully incorporated, connecting the research to the broader context of automated program repair.

Rating:
8/10

Overall, the paper is a strong candidate for acceptance. It introduces a novel approach with significant potential impact in the domain of syntax error correction, presenting a well-justified methodology, robust experimental evaluation, and clear writing. However, slightly more detail on certain technical aspects, such as the impact of beam width on results, could enhance the paper's completeness. Additionally, it would be beneficial to see more discussion on potential limitations or future work in practical deployment.
