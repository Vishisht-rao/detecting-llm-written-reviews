OUTPUT:
The paper titled "AUX-NAS: Exploiting Auxiliary Labels with Negligibly Extra Inference Cost" presents a novel approach to auxiliary learning, focusing on improving primary task performance while maintaining a low inference cost. This is achieved through an architecture-based method utilizing Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to create asymmetric networks that leverage auxiliary labels only during training.

### Strengths:
1. **Novelty and Innovation**: The concept of using an asymmetric architecture to separate training and inference costs is innovative. The idea of evolving networks with only primary-to-auxiliary links after training is quite novel in the auxiliary task learning literature.
  
2. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The paper demonstrates thorough experimentation across multiple tasks, datasets, and network backbones. This breadth validates the general applicability and effectiveness of the proposed methods.

3. **Detailed Analysis**: The authors provide a clear analysis of the method's training complexity and its linear scalability. This aspect is crucial for understanding the practicality of implementing the approach in real-world scenarios.

4. **Integration with Existing Methods**: The capability to integrate with optimization-based auxiliary learning approaches adds flexibility to the method, enhancing its appeal and potential utility in diverse settings.

### Weaknesses:
1. **Complexity of Explanation**: Some sections, particularly around NAS and the architecture design, could be clearer. While detailed, the explanations might be dense or technically challenging for readers less familiar with these concepts.

2. **Theoretical Grounding**: Although the empirical performance is impressive, additional theoretical analysis of why and how the architecture changes improve performance could strengthen the paper.

3. **Limited Discussion on Limitations**: The paper briefly touches on potential limitations or contexts where the method might not be ideal. A more candid discussion of these factors would enhance the credibility of the work.

4. **Dependence on Architecture Initialization**: The reliance on pre-trained backbones might limit the generalizability of the method for significantly different network architectures not covered in the experiments.

### Rating: 9/10
The paper presents a significant contribution to the auxiliary learning domain through its novel use of NAS and asymmetric architectures for training and inference. It combines rigorous experimentation with innovative methodological developments, providing a compelling case for its adoption. The primary areas for improvement lie in clarifying certain technical explanations and expanding on the theoretical and practical implications of the work.

Overall, this paper is a strong candidate for acceptance at ICLR 2024.

Title: AUX-NAS: Exploiting Auxiliary Labels with Negligibly Extra Inference Cost

Review:

The paper presents an innovative method called AUX-NAS, which leverages auxiliary labels from an independent task to boost the primary task's performance while maintaining a similar computational cost to that of a single-task network during inference. This approach is particularly relevant for scenarios where the performance of a single primary task is of interest, and auxiliary tasks can provide beneficial complementary information.

Key Strengths:

1. **Innovative Approach**: The concept of exploiting auxiliary tasks with minimal additional inference cost is compelling. The use of a neural architecture search (NAS) to automatically determine the optimal primary-to-auxiliary connections adds a novel aspect to the domain of auxiliary learning.

2. **Experimental Validation**: The authors provide an extensive set of experiments over multiple datasets (NYU v2, CityScapes, Taskonomy) and backbones (VGG, ResNet, ViT). The results consistently demonstrate that AUX-NAS can enhance primary task performance compared to baseline models.

3. **Integration with Optimization-Based Methods**: The ability of AUX-NAS to integrate with existing optimization-based auxiliary learning methods and further improve performance is a notable strength.

4. **Theoretical Insights**: The paper provides a well-rounded theoretical justification for its architecture choice, which emphasizes the importance of soft parameter sharing architectures in mitigating the negative transfer challenge.

5. **Comprehensive Ablation Study**: The paper includes ablation studies that thoroughly explore the contributions of different components of the proposed method, showing the significance of auxiliary gradients and features, and the impact of NAS.

Areas for Improvement:

1. **Clarity**: While the paper is generally well-written, certain sections could benefit from greater clarity, particularly those describing the NAS procedure and the specifics of the fusion operations. Visualization or pseudocode of the entire search process might enhance comprehension.

2. **Comparison with Alternative Methods**: Although the experiments are comprehensive, the paper could benefit from a deeper engagement with recent related work in NAS or multi-tasking that deploys advanced architectures or optimization strategies.

3. **Analysis of Convergence**: An analysis of the convergence properties and potential computational overhead during the NAS phase would provide additional insights regarding the practicality of the proposed method.

4. **Generalizability Discussed**: While the methodology presented is robust across various datasets, a discussion of any potential limitations regarding scalability to more varied tasks or domains would strengthen the paper.

5. **Insights into Computational Cost**: Although the paper emphasizes negligible overhead, a quantitative analysis comparing computational costs during training with other high-performing multi-task frameworks would have been insightful.

Rating: 8/10

The paper proposes a promising approach to auxiliary learning, demonstrating strong performance across various tasks while maintaining efficient inference costs. The methodology is sound and the experiments are thorough. However, clearer explication of certain methodological aspects, more direct comparisons, and detailed analyses of computational requirements would elevate the work's impact and clarity.
