Title: "ConvFormer: Revisiting Token Mixers for Sequential User Modeling"

### Review

The paper "ConvFormer: Revisiting Token Mixers for Sequential User Modeling" investigates the effectiveness of token mixers in the Transformer architecture for sequential user modeling and proposes a novel architecture, ConvFormer. The authors identify three critical criteria—order sensitivity, large receptive field, and lightweight architecture—for designing effective token mixers in the domain. They critically analyze the limitations of the self-attentive token mixer in existing Transformer-based models and propose ConvFormer, which employs a Depth-Wise Convolution (DWC) layer to address these limitations.

**Strengths:**

1. **Clear Motivation and Insightful Analysis:** The paper is motivated by the observation that simpler token mixers outperform the self-attention mechanism in sequential user modeling tasks. The authors provide a well-articulated analysis of why the self-attentive token mixer might be suboptimal for this specific domain.

2. **Novelty and Contribution:** ConvFormer, which integrates a DWC layer as a token mixer, is presented as a simple but effective solution. The introduction of criteria for designing token mixers is insightful and grounds the architectural choice in reasoned principles.

3. **Empirical Validation:** The model is tested on multiple datasets, showing consistent improvements over existing methods, including those with self-attentive token mixers.

4. **Analysis and Ablation Studies:** The paper includes thorough experimental evaluations that investigate the contribution of the DWC layer and other architectural choices. It provides detailed ablation studies and explores the effects of different design choices such as receptive field size, highlighting the impact of the proposed criteria.

5. **Practical Relevance:** The acceleration technique with Fourier convolution, ConvFormer-F, addresses the computational challenges of handling long sequences, enhancing the practical applicability of the proposed method.

6. **Breadth of Evaluation:** Besides focusing on next-item prediction in sequential user modeling, the paper extends its evaluation to a CTR prediction task, demonstrating the versatility of ConvFormer.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Technical Complexity:** Although the authors aim for simplicity, the implementation details around ConvFormer and the acceleration techniques could be clarified more explicitly for practitioners.

2. **Overemphasis on Criteria:** While the criteria for effective token mixers are insightful, the evidence and justification for each could be more robustly grounded in theory, rather than primarily in empirical findings.

3. **Baseline Selection:** While a wide range of baselines are included, deeper analysis on how ConvFormer performs against cutting-edge contemporaries in different specific contexts could strengthen the paper. 

**Rating: 9/10**

Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of sequential user modeling by proposing a well-grounded and effective modification to the Transformer architecture. The work stands out due to the innovation of its token mixer design, comprehensive evaluation, and promising results across various datasets. It is well-suited for presentation at ICLR, and thus I recommend it for acceptance.

Title: ConvFormer: Revisiting Token Mixers for Sequential User Modeling

Summary: The paper revisits the design of token mixers specifically for sequential user modeling in recommender systems. It challenges the widely accepted Transformer architecture, proposing instead the ConvFormer model. This model is a streamlined update of Transformers, replacing the self-attentive token mixer with a depth-wise convolution (DWC) layer, designed to meet three proposed criteria: order sensitivity, a large receptive field, and a lightweight architecture. The paper claims that ConvFormer surpasses existing models, achieving state-of-the-art results across several datasets.

Strengths:
1. **Novel Insight**: The paper provides a novel critique of the standard Transformer architecture, particularly in the context of sequential user modeling, which is a valuable contribution for further research in the domain.
2. **Clear Criteria**: The authors present clear criteria (order sensitivity, a large receptive field, and a lightweight architecture) for designing token mixers, which could serve as a framework for future studies.
3. **Empirical Evidence**: The paper demonstrates empirical improvements over existing baselines across four public datasets and one industrial dataset, supporting the claims with substantial experimental results.

Weaknesses:
1. **Lack of Clarity in Comparisons**: While the model claims to outperform existing solutions, the comparisons sometimes lack clarity, especially when addressing specific baselines or the contexts in which the improvements are significant.
2. **Overlooked Related Work**: There is little discussion or comparison with other models that might share similar characteristics, like MLP-Mixer or other convolutional approaches outside of Transformers.
3. **Complexity Discussion**: The practicality of ConvFormer in terms of scalability and computational overhead should be discussed more comprehensively, given the potential drawbacks of using large receptive fields.

Rating: 7/10

While the paper presents an interesting direction by questioning the adequacy of the Transformer architecture for sequential user modeling, the execution could be refined by improving clarity in methodology, comparison, and discussion of complexities. Further exploration and discussion around the scalability and computational efficiency of ConvFormer relative to its proposed advantages would enhance the paper's contributions. The work is promising and provides a solid foundation for continued exploration within the field.
