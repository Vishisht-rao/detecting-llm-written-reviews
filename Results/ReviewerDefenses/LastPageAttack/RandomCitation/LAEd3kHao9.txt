**Review of "PROMPTING LANGUAGE-INFORMED DISTRIBUTION FOR COMPOSITIONAL ZERO-SHOT LEARNING"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel approach to compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate language-informed distributions for class embeddings. The proposed method, named PLID, aims to address shortcomings in the current literature regarding diversity and informativeness of prompts, as well as the entanglement of visual primitives in visual recognition tasks. By employing techniques such as visual-language primitive decomposition (VLPD) and stochastic logit mixup (SLM), the authors argue that their method enhances generalization to unseen compositions. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets (MIT-States, UT-Zappos, C-GQA) indicate that PLID outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach:** The integration of LLMs for generating class-specific text distributions is a novel and ambitious strategy for improving CZSL tasks. The emphasis on language informativeness and context diversity provides a valuable perspective for future research in zero-shot learning and multimodal models.

2. **Empirical Results:** The experimental evaluation on well-established datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results are compelling, showing superior performance over a variety of baseline models in both closed-world and open-world settings.

3. **Comprehensive Analysis:** The paper includes a detailed ablation study, which effectively underscores the contributions of the various components of PLID. This thorough analysis gives confidence in the robustness of the proposed method and its individual features.

4. **Clarity and Structure:** The paper is well-structured, clearly articulating the research problem, methodology, and contributions. The illustrations and figures effectively support the content, helping to visualize the proposed method and results.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limitations Discussion:** While the paper acknowledges certain limitations, such as challenges in learning primitive decompositions for non-visual states, a more detailed discussion on these limitations and potential future work could strengthen the paper. For instance, the authors could suggest strategies for improving the model when dealing with abstract concepts that lack visual representation.

2. **Generative LLM Dependency:** The dependence on LLMs for generating text descriptions may introduce variability in performance due to the quality of the generated outputs. A more in-depth evaluation of the LLMs chosen (T5 and OPT) and their impact on the results could provide further insight into the robustness of the proposed method.

3. **Computational Complexity:** While authors discuss computational efficiency measures such as sharing covariance, a more thorough exploration of the computational complexity involved with PLID versus existing methods might be warranted. This could help practitioners assess the feasibility of implementing PLID in real-world applications.

4. **Limitations in External Validation:** To bolster claims of general applicability, validation of the approach on diverse datasets beyond those used could offer insights regarding the transferability of the model and effectiveness across different visual domains and tasks.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a significant advancement in the field of compositional zero-shot learning by introducing a novel methodology that incorporates language-informed distributions from LLMs. The empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of PLID is robust, and the detailed analyses add depth to the contributions. However, clearer articulations concerning the limitations, potential variability due to model choice, and computational efficiency would further enhance the presentation of this research. This paper is likely to be of great interest to researchers working in multimodal learning, zero-shot learning, and natural language processing. I recommend accepting this paper with minor revisions.
