**Review of "Bandits with Ranking Feedback"**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces a novel framework for multi-armed bandits (MAB) called "bandits with ranking feedback." In contrast to traditional MAB settings that provide numerical rewards from arm pulls, the proposed method allows a learner to only rank the arms based on observations without quantifying the differences in performance. This work is timely as it addresses practical scenarios such as matchmaking problems or online advertising where precise numerical feedback is unavailable or sensitive. The authors contribute theoretical bounds on regret for both stochastic and adversarial settings, present two algorithms (DREE and R-LPE), and provide numerical comparisons against established baselines.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty**: The concept of ranking feedback in MAB is an important contribution that fills a gap in existing literature. By exploring this new paradigm, the authors expand the applicability of bandit frameworks to more realistic scenarios.
   
2. **Theoretical Contributions**: The paper rigorously discusses the theoretical implications of using ranking feedback. The authors successfully demonstrate that ranking feedback impacts the regret guarantees, providing a meaningful insight into the necessity of numerical rewards in certain contexts (such as adversarial settings).

3. **Clear Structure**: The paper is well-structured, dividing the work into logical sections that progressively build from the introduction to the formulation of algorithms and theoretical analysis.

4. **Empirical Validation**: The numerical evaluations of the proposed algorithms against established baselines (like the EC algorithm) provide strong empirical support for the theoretical claims. Results show that the new algorithms outperform traditional approaches, adding practical relevance to the theoretical discussions.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity of Algorithms**: While the algorithms DREE and R-LPE are introduced, the complexity and computational requirements of these methods aren't extensively discussed. More details on their scalability and computational efficiency in practice would be beneficial, especially for applications with large datasets.

2. **Clarity of Certain Excerpts**: The mathematical notations and proofs, while rigorous, may be challenging for readers who are not deeply familiar with advanced bandit theory. Simplifying some sections or providing additional explanatory context would enhance readability.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: Although the paper includes empirical comparisons, it could benefit from a more extensive discussion of how the proposed methods scale relative to the size of the ranking feedback space, as well as a comparison with more recent algorithms that have also addressed non-numerical feedback in bandit settings.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Include more practical implications of the findings, such as potential use cases where the proposed algorithms excel compared to traditional techniques.
- Provide additional discussion or examples to illustrate the behavior of the algorithms under various configurations of bandit problems.
- Consider emphasizing the limitations and scenarios in which the proposed framework might struggle, which could serve as a basis for further research.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, the paper presents a significant advancement in multi-armed bandit research by introducing and analyzing bandits with ranking feedback. It opens pathways for future work in preference learning and human-in-the-loop scenarios. With some refinements in clarity and depth regarding practical implications and computational efficiency, the paper could strongly appeal to both theoretical and applied researchers in the field. Overall, this work is recommended for acceptance with minor revisions.
