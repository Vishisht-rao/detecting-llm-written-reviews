### Review of "A Soft Labeling Approach for Fairness-Aware Learning Under Partially Annotated Sensitive Attributes"

#### Summary
The paper presents a novel method for fairness-aware learning when sensitive attributes are only partially annotated. The proposed method utilizes "soft" pseudo-labels derived from the probabilities output by an attribute classifier, as opposed to "hard" labels, which can lead to biases in model learning. The authors argue that their soft regularization approach enhances both the utility and fairness of machine learning models. Additionally, they introduce an uncertainty-aware mechanism inspired by Bayesian methods to tackle the challenges posed by limited labeled data. The effectiveness of the method is validated through extensive experiments on well-known datasets, including Adult and CelebA.

#### Strengths
1. **Relevance**: The paper tackles a significant issue in machine learning—algorithmic fairness—particularly important as AI systems become more widespread. The focus on partially annotated sensitive attributes is timely and relevant given increasing concerns over data privacy and bias.
  
2. **Methodological Innovation**: The introduction of soft pseudo-labels represents a substantial innovation in fairness-aware learning. By utilizing probabilities rather than assigning fixed labels, the authors mitigate the risk of bias that can result from confidently incorrect labels. 

3. **Incorporation of Uncertainty**: The Bayesian confidence approach to regularization is an appealing feature of the proposed method. Addressing uncertainty is critical in real-world scenarios where data is often imbalanced or scarce. This adds a sophisticated layer to the methodology that enhances its robustness.

4. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The empirical validation on diverse datasets (Adult and CelebA) using both tabular and image modalities emphasizes the generalizability of the proposed method. The inclusion of multiple baselines enhances the credibility of the results.

5. **Practical Implications**: By demonstrating that their approach can improve fairness without sacrificing utility, the authors provide practical insights that can aid developers and researchers in applying fairness-aware techniques in real-world applications.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Clarity and Technical Depth**: While the overall structure of the paper is sound, certain sections are densely packed with technical details that might be overwhelming for readers less familiar with Bayesian methods or advanced machine learning concepts. Clearer explanations of critical terms and concepts would increase accessibility.

2. **Experimental Setup Details**: More information about the hyperparameters chosen for different models would aid in replicability. While some details are provided, a more comprehensive account, particularly regarding sensitivity analysis related to these parameters, would be beneficial.

3. **Discussion on Limitations**: The discussion on the limitations of the proposed method could be enhanced. For instance, scenarios where the soft labeling may still fail to improve fairness or the implications of misclassifications in the attribute classifier are worth exploring. 

4. **Broader Contextual Framework**: Although the paper discusses existing work in the space of fairness under uncertainty and partially labeled data, a stronger emphasis on how the proposed method contrasts with or builds upon existing techniques would contextualize its contributions more effectively.

#### Conclusion
Overall, this paper presents a compelling and innovative framework for addressing fairness in machine learning under the constraints of partial annotation of sensitive attributes. The dual focus on soft labeling and uncertainty-aware regularization is particularly noteworthy. While there are areas where clarity and depth could be improved, the contributions to algorithmic fairness and practical implications for real-world applications in AI make it a valuable addition to current literature. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to improve clarity and contextualization within the broader research landscape.
