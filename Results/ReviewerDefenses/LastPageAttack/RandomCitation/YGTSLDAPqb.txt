**Review of "CONNECT LATER: IMPROVING FINE-TUNING FOR ROBUSTNESS WITH TARGETED AUGMENTATIONS"**

### Overall Impression

The paper presents a novel framework for unsupervised domain adaptation known as "Connect Later," which aims to improve the out-of-distribution (OOD) performance of models trained on labeled source data when they are evaluated on unlabeled target data. The authors demonstrate through various real-world datasets, specifically in the fields of astronomy and wildlife species classification, that standard fine-tuning and merely using generic data augmentations often fail to improve OOD accuracy. Instead, their proposed method, which combines self-supervised pretraining with a second phase of fine-tuning using targeted augmentations tailored for specific distribution shifts, shows significant improvements in performance compared to several baseline methods.

### Strengths

1. **Relevance to Domain Adaptation**: The problem of domain adaptation is of great importance in machine learning, particularly in fields with limited labeled data. The study addresses this important challenge directly, providing practical insights and improvements for real-world applications.

2. **Empirical Validation**: The paper is bolstered by extensive empirical validation across four diverse datasets (ASTRO CLASSIFICATION, REDSHIFTS, IWILDCAM-WILDS, and CAMELYON 17-WILDS). The results clearly indicate that the Connect Later framework outperforms standard fine-tuning as well as other baselines.

3. **Methodological Contribution**: The proposed Connect Later approach offers a clear methodology for designing targeted data augmentations, providing a systematic way to improve model generalization that could inspire follow-up research.

4. **State-of-the-Art Results**: By achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, the authors provide strong evidence of the effectiveness of their approach.

5. **Clarity of Presentation**: The paper is generally well-structured and clearly presented, with a logical flow from the introduction to methodology and results. Figures and tables effectively illustrate key points.

### Weaknesses

1. **Theoretical Justification**: While the paper presents an intuitive explanation for why pretraining with generic augmentations is insufficient, it would benefit from a stronger theoretical underpinning that justifies the need for targeted augmentations beyond just empirical success.

2. **Augmentation Design**: The methodology for constructing targeted augmentations could be further expanded. The authors could discuss potential limitations and challenges in designing these augmentations, particularly in situations where domain knowledge is limited or when automating this process.

3. **Overfitting Concerns**: As the study is based on empirical evaluations, there is a risk of overfitting to specific datasets. Future work should explore the generalizability of the Connect Later framework across different domains and types of distribution shifts.

4. **Comparison with More Methods**: While the paper compares against several strong baselines, including ERM, self-training, and domain adaptation techniques, it may be advantageous to include comparisons with additional cutting-edge methods in domain adaptationâ€”especially recent ones that may use adversarial training or ensemble methods.

5. **Limited Interpretability**: The authors mention that targeted augmentations are defined with domain knowledge, yet how this knowledge is acquired and transformed into augmentations is not elaborated upon. A deeper exploration of this process would enhance the practical applicability of the framework.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the paper convincingly demonstrates that the "Connect Later" framework can effectively improve OOD performance through targeted augmentations, offering meaningful advancements in the domain adaptation paradigm. The empirical results are strong, although the manuscript could benefit from additional theoretical and methodological details. Overall, this work is a solid contribution to the field and should be of interest to researchers working in machine learning and domain adaptation. I would recommend this paper for acceptance with minor revisions to address the points mentioned above.
