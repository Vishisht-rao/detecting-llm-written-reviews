**Review of "SPARSE DFF: S PARSE -VIEW FEATURE DISTILLATION FOR ONE-SHOT DEXTEROUS MANIPULATION"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents SparseDFF, a novel approach for distilling view-consistent 3D Distilled Feature Fields (DFFs) from sparse RGBD images, specifically targeting one-shot learning of dexterous manipulations in robotic systems. The authors argue that the method effectively handles and generalizes to novel scenes, object poses, deformations, scene contexts, and different object categories without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. The core methodology revolves around a feature refinement network, optimized using a contrastive loss, combined with a point-pruning mechanism to maintain feature continuity and minimize discrepancies relevant to end-effector pose optimization.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach**: The concept of generating DFFs from sparse RGBD input to facilitate dexterous manipulation through a one-shot learning paradigm is novel. The framework leverages state-of-the-art large 2D vision models for the extraction of semantic features, representing a significant step forward in the field of robotic manipulation.
   
2. **Generalization Capabilities**: SparseDFF showcases promising generalization to a variety of objects, poses, and categories, which is a major challenge in robotic learning. The ability to manipulate both rigid and deformable objects enhances the method’s applicability to real-world scenarios.

3. **Real-World Validation**: The validation of the approach through extensive real-world experiments with a dexterous robotic hand increases the credibility of the results. The paper effectively demonstrates the method's adaptability and robustness across varying contexts and scenarios.

4. **Technical Robustness**: The employment of a contrastive loss during the training of the feature refinement network and the innovative point-pruning strategy highlights a methodical approach to addressing feature consistency in a 3D space, which is crucial for successful manipulation tasks.

5. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The paper includes a thorough evaluation using both qualitative and quantitative analyses. Results are presented through success rates during the grasping of different objects, complemented by illustrative figures that convey the performance visually.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Baseline Comparison**: While SparseDFF is compared against a naive DFF baseline and a state-based model, more detailed comparisons with several existing methods could provide a clearer context of the approach's advantages. The paper would benefit from addressing how SparseDFF's performance scales relative to its computational demands and efficiency compared to other leading methods.

2. **Evaluation Metrics**: Although the success rates for task performance are reported, additional metrics that quantify the manipulation accuracy, such as joint trajectory error or time taken for task completion, would provide a more nuanced view of the method's efficacy.

3. **Detailed Discussion on Limitations**: The authors mention the robustness and adaptability of their approach, but a more explicit discussion of potential limitations—such as how the method might perform in highly cluttered environments or with extremely different object shapes—would strengthen the paper. 

4. **Clarity of Methodology**: Some sections could benefit from clearer explanations, particularly in the description of the pruning mechanism and how it affects the overall performance of the end-effector optimization. More elaborate illustrations or examples might aid comprehension.

**Conclusion:**
The paper effectively introduces an innovative method for one-shot learning in dexterous manipulation, supported by solid experimental validation. SparseDFF provides a promising direction for leveraging large vision models in 3D robotic tasks and demonstrates considerable advancements in the field. With some modifications to enhance clarity and breadth of comparison, this work has the potential to significantly influence future research in robotic manipulation and related areas. 

**Recommendation:**
I recommend acceptance for presentation at the conference with the suggestion that the authors address the outlined weaknesses in a revision, focusing on enhancing comparisons with existing work and providing additional context regarding limitations and methodology.
