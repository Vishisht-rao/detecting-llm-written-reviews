### Review of "Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effect with Delayed Response"

#### Summary
The paper presents a novel approach to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) while accounting for delayed responses in observational data. The authors introduce a theoretical framework to formalize the problem, establish identifiability for potential outcomes and response times, and propose a learning algorithm called Counterfactual Regression with Delayed Feedback (CFR-DF). The method is evaluated through simulations and real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing benchmarks.

#### Strengths
1. **Relevance and Originality**: The problem addressed is highly relevant given the increasing focus on personalized interventions in fields such as medicine and marketing. The consideration of delayed responses in HTE estimation is a significant step forward, as it tackles a common limitation in existing methodologies.

2. **Theoretical Foundation**: The paper rigorously establishes the identifiability of both potential outcomes and response times. The theoretical contributions, including the proofs under multiple assumptions, provide a solid foundation for the proposed framework, which can be beneficial for researchers in causal inference.

3. **Innovative Methodology**: The CFR-DF algorithm combines counterfactual regression with a robust handling of delays, utilizing an EM-like approach for estimating latent variables. This innovative integration of delayed feedback and counterfactuals is a notable contribution to the field.

4. **Empirical Validation**: The authors present extensive experiments with both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate clear performance improvement over existing methods, showcasing the practical utility of the proposed approach.

5. **Clarity of Presentation**: The paper is generally well-structured and clearly written, making complex concepts accessible. The figures and tables complement the text and provide useful visualizations of results.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Assumptions**: The paper relies on several assumptions, including unconfoundedness and time independence. While these are common in causal inference, discussing their practical implications and potential violations in real-world scenarios would enhance the paper's depth.

2. **Generality of Results**: Although the study suggests that the proposed method can promote generality across different treatment forms, the main focus remains on binary treatment scenarios. Further explorations into multi-treatment settings would broaden the applicability of the findings.

3. **Computational Complexity**: While the authors claim improved performance with CFR-DF, there is limited discussion on the computational complexity of the algorithm compared to the baselines. Addressing efficiency in practical applications would provide a more comprehensive view of the algorithm's viability.

4. **Lack of Sensitivity Analysis**: The paper could benefit from a sensitivity analysis regarding the parameters and assumptions employed in the EM algorithm. This would help to understand the robustness of the findings against variations in the assumptions used.

5. **External Validity**: While the validation performed on synthetic and real datasets is commendable, the discussion of how these datasets represent broader, real-world scenarios could be strengthened to better justify the generalizability of the results.

#### Conclusion
The paper offers valuable contributions to the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects by incorporating delayed responses, filling a notable gap in the existing literature on causal inference. The theoretical and empirical results are promising, though the study would benefit from further discussion on its assumptions, generality, computational aspects, and external validity. Overall, it is a significant and relevant contribution to the field, and I recommend it for acceptance with minor revisions, particularly focusing on the concerns mentioned above.
