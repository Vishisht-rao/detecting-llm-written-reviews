### Review of "DV-3DL ANE: END-TO-END MULTI-MODAL 3D LANE DETECTION WITH DUAL-VIEW REPRESENTATION"

#### Summary
The submitted paper presents a novel framework called DV-3DLane for 3D lane detection in autonomous driving applications, combining both image and LiDAR data in a dual-view representation. This approach is motivated by the limitations of monocular techniques that struggle with depth perception and environmental variations. The authors propose a synergistic model that leverages multi-modal features from both perspective view (PV) and bird's-eye view (BEV) to enhance performance significantly over existing methods, achieving notable gains in F1 score and error reduction compared to prior work.

#### Strengths
1. **Innovative Approach**: The dual-view representation is a noteworthy advancement in the realm of 3D lane detection. By utilizing both PV and BEV modalities, the method captures the strengths of various sensors, significantly enhancing feature extraction and lane localization.

2. **State-of-the-Art Performance**: The results demonstrate clear superiority over existing benchmarks, as highlighted by the substantial improvements in F1 score (11.2%) and error rates (53.5% reduction). These improvements are particularly impressive given the stringent evaluation metrics employed.

3. **Comprehensive Methodology**: The paper provides a thorough explanation of three main components: the bidirectional feature fusion strategy, the unified query generation approach, and the 3D dual-view deformable attention mechanism. This structured approach effectively communicates the contributions of the proposed model.

4. **Extensive Experiments**: The use of the OpenLane dataset for experimentation provides a robust foundation for performance evaluation. The comprehensive metrics used for assessment, including F1 score, accuracy, and localization errors, give confidence in the reported results.

5. **Qualitative Insights**: The qualitative comparisons presented in the paper visually demonstrate the superiority of DV-3DLane over existing methods, adding an important layer of verification to the quantitative results.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Complexity of the Model**: The dual-view architecture and multi-modal feature fusion add complexity to the model, which may raise concerns about practicality and resource requirements when implementing in real-time systems. More discussion on computational efficiency and model size would be beneficial.

2. **Limited Depth in Comparative Analysis**: Although the paper references existing state-of-the-art methods, a more detailed comparative analysis could enhance the reader's understanding of how DV-3DLane addresses specific shortcomings of those methods, particularly regarding their limitations in adverse conditions.

3. **Lack of Detailed Ablation Studies**: While the paper presents results from ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the novel components, the depth of detail could be improved. More comprehensive explanations about the choice of parameters, variations, and their direct impacts on performance would strengthen the insights generated from these studies.

4. **Generalizability Concerns**: The experiments focus solely on the OpenLane dataset, which may limit the generalizability of the findings across different environments and real-world conditions. Testing on additional datasets could help validate robustness and applicability.

5. **Potential for Overfitting**: Given the impressive results, there is a possibility that the model may be overfitting to the characteristics of the dataset. Future work should consider cross-validation with out-of-sample data or different driving scenarios to assess the modelâ€™s generalizability.

#### Conclusion
Overall, the interplay of different modalities in DV-3DLane presents an exciting direction for 3D lane detection in autonomous driving contexts. The authors effectively demonstrate enhanced performance metrics through solid methodology and experimental validation. Addressing the noted weaknesses will enhance the robustness and utility of the work, making it a valuable contribution to the field and paving the way for further research into multi-modal systems. The paper is generally well-structured, engaging, and offers meaningful insights for researchers and practitioners alike. I recommend acceptance, pending minor revisions to address the weaknesses identified.
