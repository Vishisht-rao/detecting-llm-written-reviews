**Review of "Scalable Modular Network: A Framework for Adaptive Learning via Agreement Routing"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel framework termed the Scalable Modular Network (SMN), which emphasizes adaptive learning through a specially designed component called the "agreement router." The framework aims to enhance the adaptive capability of neural networks by enabling the integration of new modules post-pre-training. By leveraging an iterative message-passing process, the agreement router facilitates both local and global interactions among specialist modules, which together contribute to effective input module selection and representation adaptation.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Contribution:** The introduction of the agreement router is a significant advancement in enhancing modular neural networks. Its consideration of global interactions stands out from previous routing strategies that primarily focused on local interactions or relied heavily on prior metadata.
  
2. **Experimental Validation:** The authors conduct various experiments on two distinct tasks: a toy min-max game and a few-shot image classification task. The results demonstrate that SMN exhibits strong generalization capabilities and supports seamless adaptation to new tasks when integrating additional modules.

3. **Theoretical Insights:** The paper presents a clear theoretical foundation, particularly with Theorem 1, which elucidates the sparse module selection that arises from the routing process. This provides confidence in the mathematical rigor behind the SMN architecture.

4. **Practical Implications:** The framework's ability to integrate new modules without drastic performance degradation or significant retraining suggests potential for applications in real-world scenarios requiring continuous learning and adaptation.

5. **Open Source Availability:** The authors provide a link to the implementation, allowing for reproducibility and further exploration by the research community, which is praiseworthy.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Task Diversity:** While the experiments are compelling, they are primarily conducted in controlled environments (toy tasks). More complex and varied real-world applications would strengthen the validity of the contributions and showcase the robustness of the SMN framework.

2. **Comparative Analysis:** Though the paper compares SMN with existing methods, the selection of comparative models could be broadened. Including more state-of-the-art modular methods would give a clearer context of SMN's advantages and limitations in broader scenarios.

3. **Details on Module Composition:** The paper could benefit from a more elaborate discussion about the actual nature and architecture of the specialist modules. Clarity on how modules are designed, their interdependencies, and examples of different modules in practice would enhance understanding.

4. **Potential Overfitting Risks:** The paper notes a diminishing return in performance with an increase in added modules, attributing this to overfitting. More robust measures to assess and mitigate this risk would strengthen the claims regarding SMN’s scalability and adaptability.

5. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The choice and tuning of hyperparameters, particularly the balance factor (λ) in the combined loss function, could significantly impact performance. A more thorough analysis of how varying these settings influences outcomes would add depth to the evaluation.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper proposes a compelling and innovative framework for adaptive learning through scalable modular architectures. It successfully addresses important gaps in current modular neural network approaches by introducing the agreement router and demonstrating its efficacy with empirical results. While the presented findings are promising, future work with diverse tasks, a wider comparative framework, and detailed analysis of the implications of hyperparameters could enhance the robustness and applicability of SMN. I recommend this paper for acceptance at the conference with the suggestion for minor revisions to address the points raised.
