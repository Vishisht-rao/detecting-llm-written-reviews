### Review of "PRO: Pseudo-label Regularized Optimization on Unlabeled Test Data"

**Overall Impression**  
The paper presents an innovative approach, termed Pseudo-label Regularized Optimization (PRO), aimed at addressing the collapse phenomena associated with test-time training (TTT) in machine learning models, particularly in the context of visual-language models like CLIP. The proposed method achieves notable improvements in classification accuracy using only unlabeled test data, without the need for hyperparameter tuning. The results demonstrate a clear innovation in handling the limitations of existing pseudolabeling methods, making significant contributions to the field of semi-supervised learning and adaptation of large-scale models.

**Strengths**  
1. **Addressing an Important Problem**: The issue of catastrophic collapses during TTT and the challenges faced by practitioners in leveraging unlabeled data is highly relevant in machine learning. By highlighting these issues, the authors set the stage for a meaningful investigation and solution.
2. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The experiments span multiple datasets (18 in total) and demonstrate the robustness of PRO across various settings, including adaption of different model architectures (e.g., ViT-B-32 to ViT-L-14-336 and varying the parameters updated), showcasing a thorough evaluation.
3. **Effective Solutions**: The integration of multiple regularization techniques (marginal consistency, test entropy minimization, and label accumulation) into a cohesive framework provides a clear advancement over the previous methods and offers practical strategies for avoiding model collapse.
4. **Empirical Validation**: Results show significant improvements in accuracy, often leading to better performance than existing methods, such as MUST, without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning. This offers practical applicability in real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce.

**Weaknesses**  
1. **Details on Implementation**: While the approach is well-articulated theoretically, the paper would benefit from additional details on the implementation process of PRO, including how computational overhead was managed when conducting experiments with large models and datasets.
2. **Lack of Robustness Testing**: Although the paper mentions resilience to hyperparameter changes, it would be valuable to see more detailed robustness analysis concerning various types of distribution shifts or under different data scenarios, especially those related to long-tail classification performance.
3. **Limited Exploration of Failures**: The findings highlight minor failures or cases where PRO did not achieve expected gains. A more detailed examination of these cases could provide further insight into the limitations of the proposed method and areas for improvement.
4. **Future Directions**: The authors briefly mention potential future explorations related to better estimating the marginal distributions post-adaptation. Expanding on these ideas might produce even richer dialogue about the broader implications of their findings.

**Clarity and Organization**  
The paper is generally well-organized, with a logical flow from the introduction of the problem, through the methodology, and into results and discussions. However, some sections, particularly the second half, could benefit from clearer subsection headings or bullet points for major contributions to aid readability. Certain complex models of loss functions could also be more intuitively presented with additional visual aids or examples.

**References and Related Work**  
The paper engages with a solid body of related literature, drawing connections to established works in both semi-supervised learning and TTT. However, expanding the scope to include more recent advancements in domain adaptation could further contextualize their contributions within the continually evolving landscape of machine learning.

### Conclusion  
This paper presents a meaningful contribution to the field of machine learning by effectively tackling the challenges of adapting large pretrained models to new tasks using only unlabeled data. The proposed PRO method demonstrates strong empirical performance and offers practical strategies for practitioners. With some refinement in the descriptions of its limitations and implementation details, it holds strong potential for acceptance at the conference. I recommend this paper for publication with revisions to enhance clarity and robustness discussions.
