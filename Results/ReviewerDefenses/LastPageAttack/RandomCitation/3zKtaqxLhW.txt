# Review of "On-Policy Distillation of Language Models: Learning from Self-Generated Mistakes"

## Summary
The paper presents a novel approach to knowledge distillation (KD) specifically tailored for auto-regressive sequence models, introducing a method termed Generalized Knowledge Distillation (GKD). The authors argue that traditional KD methods suffer from distribution mismatch between the training data and the sequences generated by the student during inference. GKD addresses this issue by enabling the student model to learn from its own self-generated sequences, guided by feedback from a teacher model. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of GKD across various tasks, notably summarization, translation, and reasoning, compared to existing distillation methods.

## Strengths
1. **Relevance of the Problem**: The issue of distribution mismatch in KD, especially for auto-regressive language models, is well-articulated. The paper succinctly summarizes the limitations of existing methods and emphasizes the motivation behind proposing GKD.

2. **Innovative Approach**: The introduction of on-policy KD, where the student learns from its own generated outputs, is a significant departure from traditional supervised or fixed dataset-dependent methods. This could potentially reduce exposure bias and improve the quality of the generated text.

3. **Comprehensive Experimental Validation**: The authors provide extensive empirical evaluations across multiple datasets and tasks (XSum, WMT, GSM8K). The results consistently show that GKD outperforms baseline methods, showcasing its practical applicability.

4. **Clear Methodology**: The detailed description of GKD, including the algorithm and the choice of divergences used, is well-presented. The authors also analyze and provide insights on the choice of divergences, contributing to the understanding of how different approaches can affect performance.

5. **Integration with Reinforcement Learning**: The paper effectively explores the combination of GKD with reinforcement learning approaches, which could open avenues for further research in enhancing language models beyond knowledge distillation.

## Weaknesses
1. **Complexity of Implementation**: While the benefits of GKD are clear, the integration of several components (e.g., different divergence measures and the interaction with reinforcement learning) might complicate practical implementation. The implications for computational costs during training and inference could be discussed further.

2. **Limited Comparison with Emerging Methods**: Although the paper benchmarks GKD against a robust set of existing methods, it could also include a comparative analysis with emerging methods in the literature that specifically focus on on-policy or imitation learning-based distillation.

3. **Task Generalizability**: While the results are promising across the chosen tasks, further exploration of GKD's performance on diverse datasets or less common tasks could enhance its perceived versatility. An analysis of potential failure cases would also provide valuable insights.

4. **Parameter Sensitivity**: The findings indicate varying performance based on the choice of hyperparameters, such as the temperature in sampling. A more detailed study on the sensitivity of GKD to different parameter choices would benefit the reader, particularly for practitioners looking to apply the technique.

5. **Presentation Clarity**: While the paper is generally clear, there are areas (especially in the algorithm descriptions) where clarity could be improved. Including more visual aids or flowcharts might help in breaking down complex concepts for the reader.

## Conclusion
The paper successfully introduces a relevant and well-motivated extension to the KD paradigm for language models. The proposed GKD method effectively addresses the limitations of traditional approaches, particularly concerning distribution mismatch during model training and inference. Given its promising results and comprehensive experimentation, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of knowledge distillation in NLP. Addressing the outlined weaknesses could further strengthen the paper and enhance its impact on the research community. I recommend acceptance for presentation at ICLR 2024.
