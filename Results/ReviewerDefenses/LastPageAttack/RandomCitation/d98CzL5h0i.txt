**Review of "Learning to Generate Better than Your LLM"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel approach to fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) using Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques that incorporate feedback from a guide LLM. The proposed framework, referred to as Reinforcement Learning with Guided Feedback (RLGF), is evaluated across three specific text generation tasks: IMDB sentiment generation, CommonGen, and TL;DR summarization. The authors claim that their methods outperform standard supervised learning (SL) approaches and traditional RL baselines, particularly Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), by utilizing a guiding policy for improved exploration and performance.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Framework:** The introduction of RLGF and its variants enriches the ongoing discourse regarding the efficient fine-tuning of LLMs. The framework's potential to harness the interactive capabilities of black-box LLMs is an important and novel advancement in the field of AI and natural language processing.

2. **Thorough Evaluation:** The paper rigorously tests its methodologies on a diverse set of tasks, providing a comprehensive evaluation of its claims. The choice of metrics across multiple tasks ensures that the performance comparisons between the proposed methods and baselines are well-founded.

3. **Empirical Results:** The empirical results demonstrate significant improvements in performance metrics for the proposed algorithms over traditional methods, particularly in addressing the challenges posed by metric mismatches in SL.

4. **Theoretical Justification:** The authors provide a theoretical foundation for their algorithms, explaining the benefits of utilizing a guide policy in the context of structured prediction and RL, which offers insights into the strengths of their approach.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity of Algorithms:** The RLGF framework introduces several new algorithms (e.g., PPO++, AggreVaTeD, D2LOLS) that may present significant complexity. The practical implementation and optimization of these methods may be challenging for practitioners, which may limit their applicability outside the experimental setting.

2. **Dependence on Guide Policy:** The effectiveness of the proposed methods is heavily reliant on the quality of the guide policy used. The authors acknowledge this limitation but may benefit from a more thorough exploration of situations where the guide policy is suboptimal—potentially impacting the scalability and generalizability of their approach.

3. **Lack of Extensive Comparisons:** While the paper presents a comparison with PPO and some SL approaches, additional baselines, particularly those leveraging recent advancements in RL or other hybrid methods, could have further underscored the advantages of the proposed algorithms.

4. **Suboptimal Performance of Some Metrics:** In some evaluations, certain metric performances of the proposed algorithms fall short or show inconsistencies, particularly in lexical metrics like BLEU and CIDEr-D. Clarifying and addressing potential reasons for these discrepancies—perhaps through analysis or qualitative examples—would strengthen the paper.

**Overall Impression:**
The paper makes a substantial contribution to the field of LLM fine-tuning by proposing an innovative RL approach that integrates the power of guide policies. The theoretical backing, along with robust experimental results, demonstrates its potential to significantly enhance text generation tasks. However, practical applications may face challenges due to algorithmic complexity and reliance on guide policy performance. With some refinements in the comparative analysis and robustness of the methodologies presented, this work has the potential to influence the future direction of RL in natural language processing.

**Recommendation:** Accept with minor revisions.
