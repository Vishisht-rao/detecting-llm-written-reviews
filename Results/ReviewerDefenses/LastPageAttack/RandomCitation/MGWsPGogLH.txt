### Review of the Paper: "TURING COMPLETE TRANSFORMERS: TWO TRANSFORMERS ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN ONE"

**Summary**:  
The paper introduces the concept of Find+Replace transformers, a novel architecture that purportedly resolves the Turing completeness limitations of traditional transformer models. The authors argue that current large language models (LLMs), like GPT-4, are not Turing complete, leading to significant constraints on their problem-solving capabilities. They provide theoretical arguments establishing this limitation and present empirical results that demonstrate superior performance of Find+Replace transformers over existing state-of-the-art models on several complex tasks.

**Strengths**:
1. **Innovative Contribution**: This paper makes a significant advance in the field by introducing a new transformer architecture that enables Turing completeness. The authors' exploration of multi-transformer systems can inspire future research directions in the design and application of neural networks.
  
2. **Theoretical Grounding**: The paper is grounded in robust theoretical analysis, showcasing a clear understanding of computational complexity. The framework they establish ties traditional computational theory (like Turing completeness and complexity classes) to modern transformer architectures, resulting in a compelling narrative.

3. **Empirical Validation**: The experiments conducted demonstrate Find+Replace transformers outperforming GPT-4 in several composition tasks, which validates the proposed architecture. The detailed performance analysis on the Tower of Hanoi problem and dynamic programming tasks is especially noteworthy, as it suggests practical applications of the new architecture.

4. **Clarity of Presentation**: The writing is generally clear, and the paper effectively explains complex concepts. The structure is logical, guiding the reader through the motivations, theoretical discussions, and experimental results.

5. **Implications for AI Research**: The conclusions drawn about the potential of multi-transformer architectures and their links to problem-solving capabilities suggest that this work could influence the future development of AI systems and their interpretability.

**Weaknesses**:
1. **Assumptions and Generalization**: While the paper claims that existing transformers are not Turing complete, it would benefit from addressing potential counterarguments or alternative interpretations of previous works asserting their Turing completeness. Specifically, the authors might explore whether recent advancements in transformer designs (referring to models that go beyond those discussed) challenge their claims.

2. **Limitations of Find+Replace Transformers**: The paper does not sufficiently explore any potential limitations or downsides of implementing Find+Replace transformers, such as practical efficiency, scalability issues, or difficulties in training. Future work should include discussions on computational resource requirements and complexity during training and inference.

3. **Comparison with Alternatives**: Although the empirical results present an advantageous viewpoint for the new architecture, it would strengthen the paper to compare Find+Replace transformers with alternative, recent architectures that also claim to improve compositionality in LLMs. A broader comparison could provide context regarding the state of the art and the unique contributions of the proposed model.

4. **Reproducibility**: The paper lacks enough experimental detail regarding setup, hyperparameter choices, and data preprocessing, which are crucial for reproducibility in computational research. Providing more specific experimental procedures would help other researchers in validating and building upon these results.

**Conclusion**:  
Overall, this paper presents a compelling case for the introduction of Find+Replace transformers, largely advancing our understanding of transformer capabilities and their relation to computational theory. While it has notable strengths in theoretical grounding and empirical evidence, addressing some ambiguities regarding assumptions and providing more details on limitations and comparisons could significantly enhance its impact. This work paves the way for future explorations into multi-agent architectures and deeper interactions between neural networks and computational theory. I recommend its acceptance for presentation at ICLR 2023, as it contributes novel ideas and insights that will be of interest to the AI community.
