**Review of "STIMULUS: Achieving Fast Convergence and Low Sample Complexity in Stochastic Multi-Objective Learning"**

**Overall Assessment:**
The paper presents a novel algorithm, STIMULUS (stochastic path-integrated multi-gradient recursive estimator), aimed at addressing key challenges in multi-objective optimization (MOO) problems, particularly regarding convergence rates and sample complexity. The authors propose an innovative recursive framework to enhance the performance of stochastic multi-gradient descent methods, and provide theoretical analyses to substantiate their claims. Additionally, the paper showcases extensive empirical results confirming the efficacy of the proposed method compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms. 

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty and Innovation:** The introduction of the STIMULUS algorithm and its enhanced versions (STIMULUS-M and STIMULUS+ variants) reflects a significant contribution to the MOO literature, particularly in the incorporation of variance reduction techniques into the stochastic multi-gradient framework.
   
2. **Robust Theoretical Foundation:** The authors successfully establish theoretical convergence rates under both non-convex and strongly convex settings, which are highly relevant for practical applications in machine learning. The O(1/T) convergence rate is particularly noteworthy, as it matches that of deterministic methods while achieving lower sample complexity.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The experimental section demonstrates a thorough evaluation of the proposed algorithms across multiple datasets, including non-convex and strongly convex scenarios. The comparisons with existing methodologies (MGD, SMGD, and MOCO) are well-articulated, highlighting the advantages of STIMULUS in practical settings.

4. **Clarity of Presentation:** The paper is generally well-structured, making it accessible to readers from various backgrounds. Important concepts and methodologies are clearly defined, and the figures effectively illustrate the performance differences among the algorithms.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity of Notations:** While the paper presents a comprehensive analysis, certain notations and mathematical formulations may be overly intricate for readers not deeply familiar with MOO algorithms. A brief introductory section to summarize key concepts in simpler terms could enhance clarity for broader audiences.

2. **Understanding of Technical Contributions:** The introduction and related work sections could benefit from a more detailed exposition of how STIMULUS builds upon and differs from existing methodologies. A clearer differentiation could enhance the reader's understanding of the contributions made by the authors.

3. **Empirical Reproducibility:** While the experimental results showcase the strength of STIMULUS, the paper would benefit from greater detail regarding hyperparameter tuning and experimental setup. Providing more specific information about batch sizes, learning rates, and stochastic sampling details would help with reproducibility and practical application.

4. **Scalability Analysis:** The theoretical results and experiments largely focus on convergence and sample complexity without a thorough discussion on the scalability of STIMULUS in large-scale applications. Including additional experiments on larger datasets or varying complexities could provide valuable insight into the practical utility of the proposed algorithms in real-world scenarios.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. Simplify the notations and clarify key concepts, possibly supported by more illustrations or basic examples.
2. Elaborate on the discussion of existing algorithms to better contextualize the contributions of STIMULUS.
3. Provide additional details about experimental setups to aid in reproducibility.
4. Consider including discussion or experiments that illustrate the scalability of STIMULUS, particularly in high-dimensional MOO tasks.

**Conclusion:**
The paper successfully addresses important issues in the field of MOO with the introduction of STIMULUS. Its strong theoretical underpinnings combined with well-founded experimental evidence signify a meaningful advancement in this area. With some refinements in presentation and analytical depth, this work could significantly impact both theoretical research and practical applications in multi-objective optimization. I recommend acceptance for presentation at ICLR 2024, albeit with minor revisions to improve clarity and detail.
