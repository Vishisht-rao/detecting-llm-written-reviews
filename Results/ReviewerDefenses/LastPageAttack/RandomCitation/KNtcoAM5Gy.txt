### Review of "BAFTA: Backpropagation-Free Test-Time Adaptation for Zero-Shot Visual Language Models"

#### Summary
The paper presents a novel approach called BAFTA, which aims to enhance the performance of zero-shot vision-language models (VLMs) during test-time adaptation without employing backpropagation. The authors focus on the challenges faced by existing methods, particularly in selecting optimal learning rates in the absence of validation data. Instead of adjusting text prompts for refining class embeddings, BAFTA utilizes an online clustering approach directly in a projected embedding space that aligns visual and textual embeddings. The research claims that this method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques significantly.

#### Strengths
1. **Novel Contribution**: The introduction of a backpropagation-free approach to test-time adaptation is an interesting and relevant contribution, addressing key limitations observed in existing methods, such as prompt tuning.
  
2. **Thorough Experimental Validation**: The authors conducted extensive experiments across multiple challenging datasets and benchmarks, including ImageNet and fine-grained datasets. The results demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing methods, which strengthens the claim of BAFTA’s effectiveness.

3. **Clear Methodology**: The paper provides a clear explanation of the methodology, including the process of online clustering and the computation of R´enyi entropy for reliability assessment. The algorithm is articulated well, making it replicable.

4. **Evaluation Against Multiple Baselines**: The choice of diverse baselines, including TPT and CoOp, provides a comprehensive context for assessing BAFTA's contributions.

5. **Visual-Aided Explanation**: The inclusion of diagrams (e.g., Figure 1) to describe the methodology enhances understanding, especially regarding how predictions are aggregated.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Limited Discussion on Complexity**: While the paper does discuss the advantages of avoiding backpropagation, the computational complexity and efficiency of the online clustering step could have been addressed more thoroughly. Understanding how scalable BAFTA is in real-world scenarios is crucial.

2. **Reliability of Cluster Assignments**: The dependency on clustering may impact performance in cases with few examples per class, as highlighted in the paper. A more detailed analysis or empirical study on the stability and reliability of class centroids, especially in high-variance datasets, would have enriched the findings.

3. **Abstraction of Choices**: The paper mentions choosing parameters like the number of augmented views or the entropy threshold without detailing how these choices were optimized. Further discussion on parameter sensitivity could help readers understand how the results might vary with different configurations.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: Despite showing improved performance over existing methods, it would be beneficial to discuss scenarios where BAFTA might fall short compared to fully supervised methods or models trained with validation sets.

5. **Recent Literature**: While the paper references a solid array of prior work, a more exhaustive comparison with the latest techniques in the realm of test-time adaptation, especially those published since the training cut-off, could provide a clearer perspective on BAFTA’s standing in the evolving field.

#### Conclusion
Overall, the paper offers a valuable and innovative approach to enhancing the test-time adaptation of vision-language models for zero-shot learning. The comprehensive experiments and novel methodology contribute meaningfully to the field. Addressing the outlined weaknesses and providing a deeper analysis could further enhance the impact of this work. Nevertheless, BAFTA stands out as a promising approach, and its insights into clustering at inference time are likely to inspire future research directions in visual-language model adaptations. 

### Recommendation
I recommend accepting the paper for the conference, with the suggestion that the authors address the identified weaknesses in future revisions or analyses.
