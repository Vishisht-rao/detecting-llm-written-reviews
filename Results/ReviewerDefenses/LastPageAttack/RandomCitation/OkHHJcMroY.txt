### Review of the Paper: "PILOT: A NO(1/K)-CONVERGENT APPROACH FOR POLICY EVALUATION WITH NONLINEAR FUNCTION APPROXIMATION"

**General Overview:**
The paper presents a novel method for policy evaluation in reinforcement learning (RL) contexts, namely, the Path-Integrated Primal-Dual Stochastic Gradient (PILOT) algorithm. Its main contributions are centered around achieving a fast convergence rate of O(1/K) in policy evaluation (PE) problems with nonlinear function approximation, while also reducing sample complexity. The authors extend their work by introducing an adaptive-batch method, PILOT+, which further optimizes sample efficiency.

**Strengths:**
1. **Addressing Important Gaps:** The authors effectively identify significant limitations in current algorithms for nonlinear function approximation in PE. Their focus on convergence speed and sample complexity is highly relevant and addresses key challenges in the field of RL.
   
2. **Theoretical Contributions:** The paper lays out a coherent theoretical foundation for the proposed methods. The introduction of a new convergence metric is a commendable advancement that helps differentiate their analysis from existing works. The completeness of convergence proofs for both PILOT and PILOT+ is a major strength.

3. **Methodology:** The design of the PILOT algorithm utilizing variance reduction techniques together with constant step-sizes is innovative. The enhancement provided by PILOT+ leveraging historical gradient information for adaptive batch sizing could lead to practical improvements and demonstrates a thoughtful iteration on algorithmic design.

4. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The experimental section is robust, comparing results against alternative state-of-the-art methods like nPD-VR, STSG, and VR-STSG. The authors provide clear empirical evidence showing the superiority of their algorithms, supporting their theoretical findings.

5. **Clarity and Structure:** The paper is well-structured and clear, making it accessible to readers with a range of backgrounds. The progression from the introduction to the methods and onto the experimental results is logical.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Assumptions:** While the assumptions used in analysis are standard, they may limit the practical applicability of the algorithms in scenarios where these conditions aren't met. A more in-depth discussion of the implications of these assumptions and their relaxation would enhance the practical relevance of the work.

2. **Comparison with More Algorithms:** Although comparisons with existing algorithms are present, the paper can benefit from discussions on how PILOT and PILOT+ handle specific inefficiencies as compared to a broader range of algorithms. For example, discussing their performance against very recent or less conventional methods may provide additional context.

3. **Complexity Analysis:** While the authors provide some sample complexity analyses, a more thorough mathematical exploration of the computational complexity involved in both PILOT and PILOT+ would be beneficial. This helps practitioners gauge the feasibility of implementation in real-world applications.

4. **Scope of Applications:** The applications and implications of their methods beyond the immediate experimental results could be better articulated. For instance, the role of PILOT and PILOT+ in more complex or real-world RL scenarios could further establish the generality of their approach.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper provides significant contributions to the field of reinforcement learning and policy evaluation, mostly due to its theoretical innovations and rigorous experimental validation. The PILOT and PILOT+ algorithms show promise for improving convergence rates while maintaining low sample complexity. Addressing some of the noted weaknesses could further augment their impact within the research community. I recommend acceptance of this paper for presentation at ICLR 2024, with minor revisions addressing these points.
