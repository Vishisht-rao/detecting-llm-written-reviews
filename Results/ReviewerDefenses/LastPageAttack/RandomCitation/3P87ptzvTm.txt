OUTPUT:
**Review of "Optimal Multiple Transport with Applications to Visual Matching, Model Fusion, and Beyond"**

**Overall Impression:**
The paper presents a significant advancement in the field of optimal transport (OT) by generalizing traditional pairwise OT techniques to accommodate multiple probability distributions under the concept termed Optimal Multiple Transportation (OMT). The authors propose both Monge and Kantorovich formulations for OMT and offer a novel, iterative algorithm called ROMT-Sinkhorn that incorporates entropic and cycle-consistency regularization. The potential applications in visual matching and model fusion, as well as an intriguing connection to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), add considerable value and relevance to the research.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty:** The introduction of the OMT framework effectively addresses a gap in the existing literature, as traditional OT has predominantly focused on pairwise distribution challenges. The integration of multiple distributions is both timely and necessary for many real-world applications.
  
2. **Methodology:** The paper meticulously outlines the Monge and Kantorovich formulations and establishes clear mathematical underpinnings for the OMT approach. The use of cycle-consistency constraints adds depth to the methodology, which is often overlooked in OT studies.

3. **Algorithm Development:** The ROMT-Sinkhorn algorithm proposed is a strong contribution. The iterative approach and incorporation of regularization terms provide a feasible means of achieving cycle-consistency while improving computational efficiency.

4. **Empirical Validation:** The paper presents comprehensive experiments on visual multi-point matching and model fusion, demonstrating the practical benefits of the proposed approach. The results indicate that ROMT-Sinkhorn outperforms or matches many existing state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness.

5. **Clarity of Presentation:** The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making complex ideas accessible. The figures and tables effectively illustrate the results and methodologies.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limitations and Hyperparameter Tuning:** The necessity for an additional hyperparameter (Î´) in the ROMT-Sinkhorn algorithm raises concerns about scalability and practicality. The authors should consider discussing how this hyperparameter impacts performance and whether effective strategies for its tuning exist.

2. **Comparison with Strong TSP Solvers:** While the authors mention that their TSP-OMT approach opens new avenues for solving TSP, they also acknowledge that it does not yet compete with traditional TSP solvers like LKH3. Further discussion regarding the limitations of the current formulation and potential future improvements would be beneficial.

3. **Exploration of Cycle Consistency:** The concept of cycle-consistency is central to the paper. However, more exploration into the theoretical implications and possible constraints related to cycle-consistency in OMT could strengthen the contributions.

4. **Related Work:** While the authors mention several related works, a more detailed discussion of how their method compares with existing multi-marginal OT approaches could enhance the contextual grounding of their contributions.

**Conclusion:**
The paper makes a commendable and significant contribution to the field of optimal transport by introducing OMT, providing a solid theoretical foundation, and demonstrating practical applications through rigorous experiments. Addressing the identified weaknesses, particularly around hyperparameter tuning and theoretical implications, may further enhance the paper's impact. Overall, this work is well-timed and positioned to advance both the theoretical and practical dimensions of optimal transport. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
