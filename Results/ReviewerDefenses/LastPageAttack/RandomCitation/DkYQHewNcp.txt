**Review of "Unsupervised Detection of Recurrent Patterns in Neural Recordings with Constrained Filters"**

**Summary**

The submitted paper presents a novel approach for the unsupervised detection of recurrent patterns in neural recordings, focusing on spontaneous neural activity that is crucial for various cognitive processes. The proposed method leverages constrained spatiotemporal filters optimized via backpropagation, allowing for efficient and scalable analysis of large neural datasets. The authors compare their method, named convSeq, to existing techniques and demonstrate its superiority in terms of speed and the ability to provide uncertainty estimates for detected patterns. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets from mouse hippocampal recordings substantiate the methodâ€™s claims.

**Strengths**

1. **Novelty and Significance**: The problem of detecting spontaneous neural patterns is an important one in neuroscience, and the proposed method addresses a significant gap in the literature regarding scalable solutions for large datasets. The authors successfully highlight the need for such tools in contemporary neural research.

2. **Robust Methodology**: The authors provide a clear and well-structured explanation of their method, including a mathematical formulation of the loss function and the optimization process. The introduction of Gaussian parameterization for filters is a noteworthy innovation that reduces the number of learnable parameters, enhancing computational efficiency.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The experimental validation is thorough, featuring both synthetic datasets that allow for controlled examination of method performance and real-world data that demonstrate the utility of the approach. Performance metrics are clearly defined and used consistently to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the method.

4. **Empirical Speed Benchmarking**: The inclusion of detailed run-time comparisons with other existing methods provides compelling evidence of the speed advantages of convSeq. Such benchmarks are crucial for establishing the practical applicability of the proposed approach.

**Weaknesses**

1. **Assumptions and Limitations**: While the authors acknowledge the necessity to specify the number of patterns (K) and their approximate duration, the implications of such assumptions could have been discussed in more depth. Without this, users may misapply the method to datasets with very different characteristics.

2. **Complex Datasets**: The paper successfully demonstrates the method on relatively straightforward scenarios, such as linear tracks with defined place fields. Future work must extend this validation to more complex and varied neural datasets, particularly those exhibiting less distinct patterns or higher variability.

3. **False Positive Analysis**: Although statistical significance testing is utilized to control for false positives, the authors could expand the discussion on the potential limitations of this approach, especially in instances of overlapping patterns where false positives might still arise.

4. **Parameter Choices**: The authors provide guidelines on choosing critical parameters (K and M), but a deeper exploration of how parameter selection impacts performance could be beneficial. Such insights are crucial for researchers looking to apply this method to their datasets without dedicated optimization procedures.

5. **Generalization to Other Contexts**: The focus on mouse hippocampal data is appropriate for the context of the study, but further validation against a broader range of behavioral or physiological datasets could help establish the generalizability of the approach.

**Overall Evaluation**

The paper presents an innovative method with significant implications for the analysis of neural recordings. The clear articulation of the method, combined with a robust set of experimental evaluations, demonstrates its potential for advancing research in neuroscience. However, addressing the identified weaknesses, particularly concerning assumptions, parameter selection, and wider applicability, will strengthen the paper. Overall, I recommend this paper for acceptance, highlighting its contributions to both theoretical and practical aspects of neural data analysis.
