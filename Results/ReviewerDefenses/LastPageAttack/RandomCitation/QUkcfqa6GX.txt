**Review of "SPATIO-TEMPORAL GRAPH LEARNING WITH LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL"**

**Summary:**
This paper presents a novel framework, dubbed STLLM (Spatio-Temporal Large Language Model), which integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve spatio-temporal prediction tasks in urban computing. The authors argue that urban phenomena display complex spatio-temporal dependencies that can be better captured by leveraging the global contextual knowledge available in LLMs. The proposed methodology seeks to address common challenges in spatio-temporal prediction, including long-range dependencies, data sparsity, and dynamic changes in urban environments.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The integration of LLMs into spatio-temporal prediction is an innovative aspect that significantly contributes to the field of urban computing. The recognition of districts' subtle yet complex semantic relationships in urban settings aligns well with contemporary trends in AI.

2. **Comprehensive Approach**: The framework's design encapsulates multiple dimensions of spatio-temporal analysis. By employing cross-view mutual information maximization and GNN-based modeling, STLLM offers a robust tool for enhancing the predictive capabilities with respect to crime rates, traffic flows, and other urban metrics.

3. **Empirical Validation**: The authors provide extensive experimental evaluations on various datasets, demonstrating STLLM's superior performance over traditional baselines across different tasks. The detailed analyses and ablation studies further solidify the framework's efficacy and robustness.

4. **Clear Structure**: The paper is well-organized, guiding the readers through the introduction of concepts, the proposed methodology, and concluding with empirical results. This clarity aids in understanding the intricacies of spatio-temporal learning while using LLMs.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity of Explanation**: Some sections, particularly the mathematical derivations and formulations (e.g., mutual information maximization and InfoNCE loss), may be overly complex for readers unfamiliar with advanced statistical methods and deep learning nuances. A clearer, more intuitive explanation or visual aids could improve accessibility.

2. **Discussion on Limitations**: While the paper highlights the advantages of integrating LLMs, it lacks a thorough discussion of the potential limitations or challenges (e.g., computational costs, specific scenarios where LLMs might underperform, or ethical considerations related to LLM usage).

3. **Dataset Variety**: The paper primarily evaluates the proposed STLLM on datasets from Chicago and NYC. While these urban settings provide valuable insights, the generalizability of STLLM to other diverse urban environments remains untested. Including additional datasets or discussing the implications for cross-city applications could enhance the paper's contribution.

4. **Future Work Direction**: While the authors mention plans to investigate the interpretability of the model, further elaboration on potential applications or how this framework could evolve with future urban automation technologies could enrich the conclusion.

**Minor Comments:**
- Each section could benefit from a summary sentence that encapsulates the main ideas, particularly in the methodology and experimental findings.
- Typographical and formatting issues were encountered in some parts, which may hinder clarity (e.g., equations that could be more prominently displayed).

**Conclusion:**
Overall, "SPATIO-TEMPORAL GRAPH LEARNING WITH LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL" presents a compelling framework that effectively marries LLM capabilities with graph neural methodologies to advance our understanding of spatio-temporal predictions. The strengths of novel integration and thorough empirical evaluation largely outweigh the noted weaknesses. With adjustments in accessibility and discourse around limitations, this paper could serve as a significant reference for future endeavors in urban computing and predictive modeling. I recommend acceptance, with revisions focused on enhancing clarity and addressing the discussed limitations comprehensively.
