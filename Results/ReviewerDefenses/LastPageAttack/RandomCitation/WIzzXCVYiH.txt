**Review of "GNNBoundary: Towards Explaining Graph Neural Networks Through the Lens of Decision Boundaries"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel method called GNNBoundary aimed at enhancing the interpretability and explainability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by focusing on the decision boundaries that dictate their classification processes. The authors argue that while there is a growing body of literature around interpreting GNNs, there is a lack of methods that specifically analyze decision boundaries. By identifying adjacent class pairs and generating near-boundary graphs, the proposed framework aims to uncover insights into the characteristics of decision boundaries, thus facilitating a better understanding of the GNN's decision-making process. The authors validate their approach through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets and present several metrics to evaluate boundary characteristics.

**Strengths:**
1. **Originality**: The approach of focusing on decision boundaries for explaining GNNs is novel, filling a significant gap in the current literature on interpretability methods. The paper introduces a fresh perspective that contrasts with typical instance-level explanations.

2. **Clear Methodology**: The authors clearly outline the steps involved in GNNBoundary, including class adjacency identification, boundary generation algorithms, and the application of a dynamic regularization scheduler. The methodology is well-structured and easy to follow.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The experiments conducted utilize a variety of datasets, both synthetic and real-world, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The inclusion of multiple metrics for boundary thickness, margin, and complexity provides a thorough assessment of the model’s performance.

4. **Use of Novel Objective Function**: The developmental focus on an adaptive loss function that emphasizes boundary graph generation is commendable, and the empirical results presented suggest that this leads to better convergence properties compared to traditional loss functions such as cross-entropy.

5. **Insightful Case Studies**: The case studies provide useful insights into how boundary characteristics can inform about robustness and misclassification risks, which are critical for applications in sensitive domains.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Comparisons**: The lack of existing methods specifically aimed at analyzing decision boundaries poses a challenge in evaluating the performance of GNNBoundary. While the proposed baseline methods provide some context, it would enhance the contribution to include more comparative studies with established interpretability techniques, even those that are instance-based.

2. **Scalability Concerns**: The paper does not sufficiently address how GNNBoundary scales with larger, more complex graphs, especially in practical applications where computational resources may be constrained. Providing scalability benchmarks would strengthen the discussion around the applicability of the method.

3. **Potential Bias in Evaluation**: The evaluation metrics appear to assess the closeness of generated graphs to decision boundaries, but there could be an inherent bias toward the datasets used. An analysis of how well GNNBoundary performs across diverse and domain-specific datasets can help in understanding its generalizability.

4. **Discussion of Limitations**: While the authors discuss the adaptability and advantages of their method, there is little to no acknowledgment of potential limitations, biases, or edge cases. Addressing this would provide a more balanced view of the framework and contribute to future work in the area.

5. **Visualizations**: While the paper includes some figures demonstrating the methodology and results, more detailed visual comparisons between GNNBoundary outputs and traditional methods could enhance readers' understanding of the proposed method's effectiveness.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper "GNNBoundary: Towards Explaining Graph Neural Networks Through the Lens of Decision Boundaries" presents a valuable contribution to the field of explainable AI, specifically for GNNs. The analysis of decision boundaries as a means of interpretation is not only innovative but also addresses a clear need in the research community. While the work is solid and well-explained, addressing some of the weaknesses highlighted above—particularly around comparisons, scalability, and an acknowledgment of limitations—could significantly strengthen the paper. Thus, I recommend acceptance to the conference, contingent on minor revisions to enhance clarity and comprehensiveness.
