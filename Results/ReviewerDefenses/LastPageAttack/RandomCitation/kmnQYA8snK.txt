**Review of "Scaling Up Trustless DNN Inference with Zero-Knowledge Proofs"**

**Summary:**
The submitted paper investigates the deployment of machine learning (ML) models in untrusted environments, focusing on the verification of model inference in the ML-as-a-Service (MLaaS) paradigm. The authors present a novel approach utilizing ZK-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) to allow model consumers to trustlessly verify predictions made by service providers. The paper claims to achieve the first practical ZK-SNARK proof of valid inference for ImageNet-scale models, showcasing applications in multiple MLaaS scenarios.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Contribution:** The authors claim a significant advancement in applying ZK-SNARKs to large-scale ML models, specifically providing a practical way to verify inference for ImageNet models. This addresses a critical gap in the literature, as previous work primarily focused on smaller datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10.
   
2. **Technical Depth:** The paper delves deeply into the technical aspects of ZK-SNARKs, providing a thorough explanation of the arithmetization process, custom gates, and optimizations used. The explanations are well-structured and comprehensive, likely benefiting readers with a solid background in cryptography and neural networks.

3. **Multiple Applications:** The proposed protocols cover various use cases, including model accuracy verification and trustless document retrieval. This versatility adds value to the contribution and showcases the practical implications of the work.

4. **Performance Metrics:** The paper provides extensive empirical evaluations of the proposed ZK-SNARK constructions, including performance benchmarks in terms of proving and verification times, accuracy, and proof sizes. Such quantitative results strengthen the paper's claims about the feasibility of the proposed methods.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Clarity and Readability:** While the technical depth is commendable, the paper may be dense for readers lacking extensive background knowledge in advanced cryptography and machine learning. Certain sections, particularly those detailing the arithmetization and the custom gates, may benefit from simplified language or supplementary explanations for broader accessibility.

2. **Assumption Background:** The paper mentions assumptions for security and viability but does not provide sufficient motivation for these choices. A clearer discussion around the implications of these assumptions could enhance the understanding of the systemâ€™s reliability under different adversarial models.

3. **Broader Implications:** The authors could expand upon the real-world implications of adopting ZK-SNARKs for trustless verification in practical MLaaS environments. Discussions on the potential market impact, regulatory concerns, or ethical implications of such technologies would provide a more holistic view of the proposed solutions.

4. **Comparison to Alternatives:** While the paper discusses limitations of prior work, it does not thoroughly analyze the trade-offs between ZK-SNARKs and other secure ML methods, such as homomorphic encryption or MPC (Multi-Party Computation). A comparative analysis would help situate their work within the field and clarify when to select this approach over others.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper presents a substantial contribution to the area of trustless machine learning inference by leveraging ZK-SNARKs for ImageNet-scale models. The technical innovation and empirical evaluation make it a worthwhile candidate for the ICLR 2024 conference. However, improvements can be made in clarity, contextual grounding of assumptions, and broader discussions about implications. Addressing these weaknesses could significantly enhance the impact and comprehensibility of the work.
