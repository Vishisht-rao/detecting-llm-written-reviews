**Review of "MODIFY TRAINING DIRECTION IN FUNCTION SPACE TO REDUCE GENERALIZATION ERROR"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel approach to improving the generalization performance of neural networks by modifying the dynamics of training via a new technique called Modified Natural Gradient Descent (Modified NGD). The authors leverage the theory of Neural Tangent Kernels (NTK) to analyze the learning process of neural networks in function space rather than parameter space, proposing a framework that modifies the training direction in eigenspaces of the Fisher information matrix to reduce the generalization error.

**Strengths:**
1. **Theoretical Foundations**: The paper is deeply rooted in sound theoretical frameworks, including the Natural Gradient Descent and NTK theories. The authors provide a comprehensive analysis and derivation of the generalization error and the conditions under which their method can improve generalization.
 
2. **Innovative Concept**: The introduction of the Modified NGD, which adapts the Fisher information matrix in function space, represents a significant theoretical contribution. The approach of using eigendecomposition of the Fisher matrix to decide on training modifications is promising and provides a new perspective on effective training strategies.

3. **Numerical Experiments**: The numerical validation of the theoretical results is well-presented, showing clear evidence that Modified NGD effectively reduces generalization error compared to standard techniques. The use of synthetic data along with real-world datasets (HTRU2) strengthens the empirical claims of the paper.

4. **Contextualization**: The authors do an excellent job of situating their work within the broader context of existing literature on generalization-enhancing methods, illustrating connections to methods such as self-distillation and cross-domain generalization.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity of Presentation**: The mathematical exposition, while thorough, can be dense and challenging for readers not already familiar with the advanced concepts involved (e.g., eigenspaces of the Fisher information matrix, NTK). A clearer and more intuitive explanation of the implications of these mathematical constructs could improve accessibility.

2. **Limited Exploration of Practical Applications**: While the theoretical results are solid, the authors might consider discussing potential practical implications and applications of Modified NGD in more detail. Suggestions for implementing this approach in common training frameworks or potential pitfalls in real-world scenarios could provide valuable insights.

3. **Experimentation Details**: The experimental section, while robust, could benefit from additional detail about the hyperparameter choices, especially the rationale behind settings used in Modified NGD versus conventional approaches. More extensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods could further validate the proposed technique.

4. **Convergence Properties**: The paper claims that the network function converges as time approaches infinity. However, further elaboration on the convergence properties of Modified NGD in practice compared to SGD could enrich the discussion, particularly in terms of optimization speed and stability.

**Conclusion:**
The paper provides a compelling theoretical advancement in the understanding of neural network training dynamics and introduces a novel method for reducing generalization error through modifications in function space. Despite some areas that could be clarified or expanded, the contributions are significant and present a meaningful step forward in the pursuit of efficient training methodologies in deep learning. This paper has the potential to stimulate further research and application in the field, especially regarding generalization in high-dimensional function spaces. 

Overall, I recommend this paper for acceptance at ICLR 2024, with minor revisions to enhance clarity and practical relevance.
