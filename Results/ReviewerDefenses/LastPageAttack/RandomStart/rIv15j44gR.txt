**Review of “Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effect with Delayed Response”**

**General Comments:**
This paper addresses a critical and timely issue in causal inference regarding the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) under conditions of delayed response. The authors propose a novel method, Counterfactual Regression with Delayed Feedback (CFR-DF), which simultaneously estimates potential outcomes and response times, accounting for the delay in feedback commonly observed in practical applications such as medicine and marketing. The theoretical foundations provided, as well as the empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets, indicate the significance and applicability of the proposed approach.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty and Relevance:** The identification of the problem of delayed responses in HTE estimation fills an important gap in the current literature. Many existing methods do not account for the temporal aspect of treatment effects, thereby leading to potential biases. This paper contributes a fresh perspective to a critical area of research.

2. **Theoretical Contributions:** The authors provide solid theoretical guarantees for the identifiability of potential outcomes and response times within the framework proposed. Theorems and proofs concerning the assumptions are clearly laid out and enhance the depth of the analysis.

3. **Methodology:** The CFR-DF algorithm is well-constructed, leveraging a modified EM algorithm that appropriately handles the latent outcome problem while considering the confounding bias. The inclusion of balancing regularization through the Integral Probability Metric (IPM) is a particularly noteworthy feature that augments the model's robustness.

4. **Empirical Validation:** The comprehensive experimental evaluation, which includes synthetic data with controlled variability and real-world datasets, effectively demonstrates the performance and advantages of the CFR-DF approach over existing methods. The results are quantitatively significant, showing improvements in estimation accuracy with respect to several metrics (PEHE and ϵATE).

5. **Clarity and Structure:** The manuscript is well organized and generally easy to follow. The use of figures and tables to illustrate key results and methodologies contributes positively to the readability and understanding of the research.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Assumptions and Their Practicality:** While the paper rigorously lays out several assumptions necessary for the identifiability results, the reliance on these assumptions (particularly regarding unconfoundedness and principal ignorability) may limit the practical applicability of the method in contexts where these assumptions do not hold. Future work could explore methods for relaxing these assumptions or developing sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the findings.

2. **Limited Discussion on Computational Complexity:** Although the paper provides some computational details, there is limited discussion on the scalability of the CFR-DF algorithm in large datasets or high-dimensional spaces. Consideration of computational efficiency and scalability could enhance the practical relevance of the proposed methodology.

3. **Potential Overfitting:** The flexibility of the proposed methods may lead to overfitting, particularly when the model complexity increases with many features. It might be beneficial to include techniques such as cross-validation or regularization strategies to mitigate this concern.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. A more elaborate discussion on limitations and how they impact the generalizability of the results would be beneficial.
2. Addressing potential scalability issues explicitly, perhaps by including a section dedicated to computational efficiency or runtime analyses, could further strengthen the paper.
3. Providing additional insights or guidance on practical implementations of the CFR-DF method in real-world scenarios would enhance its utility for practitioners.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of causal inference by addressing an important aspect of treatment effect estimation that has been overlooked in prior research. The theoretical and empirical underpinnings of the proposed CFR-DF method are sound, and its performance advantages over existing algorithms are clearly demonstrated. With minor revisions to strengthen discussions around assumptions and computational considerations, this work holds the potential for impactful application across various domains. I recommend acceptance of this paper for presentation at ICLR 2024.
