**Review of "GNNBoundary: Towards Explaining Graph Neural Networks Through the Lens of Decision Boundaries"**

**Summary**
The paper introduces a new model-level explainability method named GNNBoundary, aimed at elucidating the decision boundaries of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While existing studies primarily focus on instance-level explanations or feature descriptors for specific classes, this work highlights the importance of understanding the relationships between class pairs and their adjacent decision regions. GNNBoundary identifies adjacent class pairs and generates near-boundary graphs by optimizing a novel objective function. The authors present experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in generating faithful boundary graphs and analyzing decision boundaries.

**Strengths**
1. **Novelty**: The approach taken by the authors is commendable as it addresses a largely unexplored area in GNN explainability â€” the understanding of decision boundaries. This perspective adds significant value to the existing body of knowledge in the field.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The authors provide thorough evaluations using a variety of datasets, both synthetic and real-world, while also comparing their method against baseline approaches. The qualitative and quantitative findings reported are robust, providing a clear demonstration of the efficacy of GNNBoundary.

3. **Clear Methodology**: The explanation of the methodology, including the algorithms for identifying adjacent classes and generating near-boundary graphs, is well-articulated. The introduction of a novel objective function tailored for boundary graph generation is particularly strong.

4. **Practical Implications**: The outcomes of boundary thickness, boundary margin, and boundary complexity, which are assessed through case studies, offer practical implications for understanding the robustness and generalizability of GNNs. This has the potential to increase trust in GNN decisions, especially in sensitive applications.

5. **Accessible Presentation**: The paper is well-structured, with a logical flow from the introduction through to methodology, results, and conclusion. The use of figures, such as the overview of GNNBoundary and various results, enhances accessibility and comprehensibility.

**Weaknesses**
1. **Comparative Analysis**: While the authors establish a baseline for comparison, they could strengthen their case further by discussing potential limitations and benefits of their method in more detail compared to existing methodologies. The absence of a diverse range of methods for comparison in the experiments also raises concerns about the generality of the conclusions drawn.

2. **Limited Discussion on Interpretability**: The paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion regarding how the generated boundary graphs could be utilized in practice. For example, specific use-cases or applications where understanding decision boundaries could guide model improvement or evaluation would enhance the practical relevance of the work.

3. **Potential Overfitting**: Given the focus on generating near-boundary graphs, there is a risk of overfitting to certain characteristics of the training data. The authors should address potential pitfalls associated with overfitting in the context of explainability and robustness.

4. **Clarity of Technical Content**: Certain sections with dense technical content, especially within the formalism of learning objectives and boundary graph generation, may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with graph theory or advanced machine learning concepts. Breaking down these sections further or providing additional illustrative examples could be beneficial.

**Conclusion**
In conclusion, "GNNBoundary: Towards Explaining Graph Neural Networks Through the Lens of Decision Boundaries" makes a significant contribution to the field of GNN interpretability by revealing insights into decision boundaries and their implications for model behavior. While the methodology and results are compelling, the paper would benefit from a more thorough comparative analysis, practical applicability discussion, and clarity in conveying technical details. Overall, I recommend the paper for acceptance, with suggestions for improvements and clarifications that would elevate its impact.
