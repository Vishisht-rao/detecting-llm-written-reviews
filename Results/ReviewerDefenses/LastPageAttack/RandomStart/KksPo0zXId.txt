**Review of "A FAST FRAMEWORK FOR POST-TRAINING STRUCTURED PRUNING WITHOUT RETRAINING"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel framework for structured pruning in deep neural networks that allows effective model compression without the need for retraining. Aimed at addressing challenges in real-world scenarios where data privacy and computational constraints limit retraining opportunities, the proposed method combines dependency-based channel grouping with a two-phase reconstruction strategy involving sparsity penalties. This strategy is tested on several datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, showing significant efficiency and performance improvements compared to both retraining-free and retraining-based pruning methods.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Relevance:** The proposed framework addresses a critical gap in existing literature on structured pruningâ€”specifically, the inability to perform effective pruning without retraining. This is particularly relevant as model deployment often encounters limitations on data access and computational resources.

2. **Methodological Rigor:** The paper outlines a clear methodology, detailing how coupled structures are formed and how group-level importance is determined. The two-phase reconstruction process is well-justified and addresses potential issues with information loss during pruning.

3. **Empirical Validation:** The authors provide extensive experimental results comparing their method against both retraining-free and retraining methods, including a range of architectures and datasets. The results indicate that their method often matches or outperforms other techniques in terms of accuracy while reducing FLOPs more effectively.

4. **Implementation Efficiency:** The ability to prune models within minutes on a single GPU is a significant advantage, potentially enabling real-time model optimization in deployment scenarios.

5. **Contribution to Existing Research:** The study contributes to the field by advancing methods of post-training compression techniques, particularly for structured pruning, and opens avenues for further research in efficient model optimization.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Dataset Diversity:** While results from CIFAR and ImageNet are strong, the lack of experiments on other architectures or datasets, particularly in different domains (e.g., NLP or speech), limits the generalizability of the findings. Future work should consider applying the framework to a broader range of network architectures and real-world datasets.

2. **Comparative Analysis:** Although the authors compare against notable existing methods, a more extensive set of baselines could provide deeper insights into the effectiveness of their approach. The inclusion of additional state-of-the-art methods would strengthen their claims of superiority.

3. **Potential Overfitting on Calibration Data:** The reliance on a small amount of calibration data (0.2% of the training set) raises concerns about generalizability. The paper should discuss the risk of overfitting to this limited data and consider different configurations that may be more robust.

4. **Clarity and Details in Methodology:** While the framework is described well, certain aspects of the methodology, such as the specifics of importance scoring and the chosen hyperparameters, could use more thorough explanation or justification. A detailed discussion of parameter selection (e.g., the choice of penalty coefficients) could enhance reproducibility.

5. **Error Analysis:** The paper lacks a thorough discussion on failure cases or scenarios where the proposed method may struggle. Understanding the limitations will help to contextualize results and identify future research directions.

**Overall Assessment:**
The paper presents a compelling advancement in the area of structured pruning for deep neural networks. The balance of novelty, empirical results, and practical implications positions this work as a significant contribution to model compression literature. However, the limited dataset diversity and the need for a more comprehensive comparative analysis are areas for improvement. With minor revisions to address these concerns, this work could make a strong impact in both academia and industry applications. 

**Recommendation:** Accept with minor revisions.
