**Review of "DISTRIBUTIONAL STRUCTURED PRUNING BY LOWER BOUNDING THE TOTAL VARIATION DISTANCE USING WITNESS FUNCTIONS"**

**Summary:**
The authors propose a novel approach to distributional structured pruning (DSP) in deep neural networks (DNNs) by introducing a method for estimating the discriminative ability of filters based on lower bounds of the Total Variation (TV) distance using witness functions. The paper argues that the Gaussian assumption made in previous works is restrictive and does not hold in practice, motivating the need for a more versatile pruning approach. The proposed framework, titled WitnessPrune, leverages moment information and allows for the pruning of non-discriminative filters without requiring access to training data or the loss function. The authors provide empirical evidence showing improvements in accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty and Importance:** The concept of using witness functions to establish lower bounds on the TV distance is a notable advancement that potentially enables more effective and realistic pruning strategies. The focus on the limitations of the Gaussian assumption is commendable and addresses a significant gap in the current literature.

2. **Methodological Rigor:** The authors provide a clear theoretical foundation with well-defined theorems and corollaries linking the TV distance to established discriminant-based classifiers. This connection enhances the understanding of the metrics used for pruning decisions.

3. **Empirical Validation:** The thorough experimental evaluations across various datasets (including CIFAR10 and Two Spirals) demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Achieving up to 7% greater accuracy for similar sparsity levels compared to existing methods is an impressive result.

4. **Accessibility:** The claim that the proposed methods do not require access to the training dataset or loss function greatly enhances applicability in various real-world settings, where such data may be unavailable due to privacy concerns.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Clarity and Structure:** While the paper provides a substantial amount of detail, certain sections could benefit from clearer exposition. For instance, the presentation of algorithms and theoretical results could be streamlined to enhance readability for a broader audience, particularly those less familiar with advanced statistical measures.

2. **Dependency on Moments:** The approach relies heavily on the moments of distributions. It would be beneficial if the authors addressed how robust their techniques are to outliers or distributions with heavy tails, which could potentially skew moment calculations.

3. **Comparative Analysis:** While the paper presents results against state-of-the-art methods, it could enrich the analysis by including more comparative metrics, such as inference time or computational efficiency, especially since pruning aims not only to improve accuracy but also to reduce model complexity.

4. **Generalizability:** Although the experiments are well-conducted, discussing the limitations and scenarios where the proposed method might underperform or fail would provide a more balanced view of its capabilities.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper is a valuable contribution to the field of neural network pruning, providing a fresh perspective on distributional structured pruning. The theoretical contributions, combined with empirical support, suggest that the proposed methods could positively impact the ongoing research and practical applications of deep learning models. With minor improvements in clarity and comparative analysis, this work could serve as a cornerstone for future investigations into efficient model compression techniques. I recommend the authors consider these points for enhancing the paper's clarity and impact.
