### Review of "BAFTA: Backpropagation-Free Test-Time Adaptation for Zero-Shot Visual Language Models"

#### Overview
The paper presents a novel method named BaFTA (Backpropagation-Free Test-Time Adaptation) designed to enhance zero-shot image classification using large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. It proposes an approach that sidesteps the challenges associated with backpropagation during test-time adaptation, particularly the difficulties in selecting optimal learning rates in the absence of validation data. Instead, BaFTA uses online clustering to estimate class centroids directly in a projected embedding space, combining predictions from original class embeddings with those from augmented views, thereby enhancing accuracy.

#### Strengths
1. **Innovation**: BaFTA introduces an innovative approach to zero-shot learning in VLMs by avoiding backpropagation during inference, which could provide a practical solution for real-world applications where model stability during adaptation is critical.

2. **Thorough Evaluation**: The authors supply a comprehensive set of experiments comparing BaFTA against various other state-of-the-art methods, including test-time prompt tuning, demonstrating substantial improvements across multiple benchmark datasets.

3. **Methodological Rigor**: The paper carefully details the proposed online clustering approach and provides a clear justification for using R´enyi entropy to assess the reliability of predictions. The explanations surrounding the projections of embedding spaces and clustering processes are mathematically sound.

4. **Explicit Contribution**: The authors summarize their contributions clearly, detailing how BaFTA addresses specific limitations of existing methods. The four key contributions are well articulated, providing clarity on the significance of the proposed method.

5. **Performance Gains**: The results indicate that BaFTA significantly outperforms existing methods without the need for labeled data or backpropagation, which is an important advancement in the field.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Complexity**: While the use of online clustering and entropy-based aggregation is interesting, it adds complexity to the method that might pose integration challenges in practical applications. The computational overhead of estimating centroids in real-time and maintaining accuracies through dynamic updates could be discussed more thoroughly.

2. **Potential for Overfitting**: The reliance on the performance of clustering methods could lead to overfitting, particularly on datasets with limited examples. The robustness of the method across diverse datasets should be examined in more detail, particularly under the varying distributions present in real-world scenarios.

3. **Limited Focus on Edge Cases**: The paper mentions the limitations related to classes with fewer examples, but further exploration into how BaFTA deals with edge cases or outliers would be beneficial. A detailed case study or real-world example showcasing potential pitfalls would enhance understanding.

4. **Entropic Aggregation Justification**: Although R´enyi entropy is posited as more reliability-focused, the paper does not fully engage with alternative aggregation strategies or sufficiently critique their potential, which may leave some readers wanting for more comprehensive comparative analysis.

5. **Visual and Textual Misalignment**: The paper discusses projections for alignment but does not extensively detail how this impacts model performance in domains where visual and textual data are more significantly misaligned.

#### Conclusion
The paper makes a compelling contribution to the domain of zero-shot visual classification by proposing a method that alleviates common issues faced during test-time adaptation in VLMs. With clear advancements over conventional methodologies, BaFTA stands to benefit both theoretical research and practical implementations in machine learning systems. However, additional analyses addressing the concerns raised could significantly bolster the robustness of the claims made. Overall, I recommend acceptance for publication, contingent on addressing the noted weaknesses.
