**Review of "A Soft Labeling Approach for Fairness-Aware Learning Under Partially Annotated Sensitive Attributes"**

---

**Summary:**

The paper presents a novel approach for addressing algorithmic fairness in machine learning models that operate under the constraint of partially annotated sensitive attributes. The authors argue that existing methods typically rely on attribute classifiers that produce "hard" pseudo-labels, which can lead to overfitting and potentially harm the fairness performance of models. The proposed solution involves the use of "soft" pseudo-labels derived from the probabilistic outputs of attribute classifiers, and the incorporation of uncertainty into the regularization process. The effectiveness of this soft labeling approach is validated through extensive experiments conducted on the Adult and CelebA datasets.

**Strengths:**

1. **Relevance and Importance:**
   - The topic of algorithmic fairness is critically important and timely, especially in light of recent discussions surrounding biases in AI systems. The authors effectively highlight the gaps in existing approaches that assume fully labeled sensitive attributes, which is a common limitation in practical applications.

2. **Novel Contributions:**
   - The introduction of soft labeling and the incorporation of uncertainty into the fairness optimization process are notable contributions. The dual Bayesian perspective on uncertainty is particularly innovative and provides a fresh lens through which to analyze fairness under incomplete data conditions.

3. **Comprehensive Experimental Validation:**
   - The authors conduct a wide range of experiments on two diverse datasets (Adult and CelebA), providing solid empirical evidence for the advantages of the soft regularization method over existing baselines. The results clearly illustrate improvements in both accuracy and fairness metrics, which strengthens the validity of their claims.

4. **Clear Methodological Framework:**
   - The paper outlines detailed methodological formulations and algorithmic implementations. The clear delineation of soft regularization methods and uncertainty formulations aids in understanding the proposed framework.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Clarity and Accessibility:**
   - While the methodological sections are comprehensive, some parts of the paper could benefit from improved clarity, particularly in the mathematical formulations. For readers unfamiliar with Bayesian techniques or fairness metrics, certain explanations may seem dense or overly technical.

2. **Baseline Comparisons:**
   - Although the paper compares against several baselines, a deeper analysis of these comparisons could enhance the discussion. For instance, elaborating on the selection criteria for baseline methods, or discussing their limitations more thoroughly, could provide valuable context for the performance implications observed.

3. **Scope of Experiments:**
   - The experiments are primarily focused on two datasets, which may limit the generalizability of the results. Additional experiments on varied datasets across different domains could showcase the robustness of the proposed method and its applicability in real-world settings.

4. **Discussion of Trade-offs:**
   - While the authors emphasize the improved trade-offs between utility and fairness, a more nuanced discussion of the potential trade-offs or limitations of employing uncertainty-aware methods could provide a balanced perspective. This would be particularly relevant for practitioners who must consider computational costs and interpretability.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. Enhance clarity in mathematical formulations and provide accompanying explanations or intuitive interpretations to aid reader comprehension.
2. Expand the comparison and discussion of baseline methods, shedding light on their limitations and contextualizing the significance of the proposed approach.
3. Consider conducting experiments on additional datasets and provide a discussion on the applicability of the method across different domains.
4. Discuss potential trade-offs and limitations in employing the proposed methods, especially regarding computational efficiency and model interpretability.

Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of fair machine learning by proposing an innovative soft labeling approach that effectively addresses the challenges posed by partially annotated sensitive attributes. The method demonstrates empirical superiority over various baselines, and the theoretical underpinnings are well-articulated. Addressing the noted weaknesses and incorporating suggested improvements could further elevate the impact of this work within the research community and practical applications. The paper has strong potential for acceptance at ICLR 2024.
