### Review of "SCALABLE MODULAR NETWORK: A FRAMEWORK FOR ADAPTIVE LEARNING VIA AGREEMENT ROUTING"

**Summary:**
The authors propose a novel framework, the Scalable Modular Network (SMN), which introduces an adaptive learning capability via an innovative routing mechanism called the "agreement router." This framework is designed to facilitate the integration of new modules into a pre-trained model to enhance adaptability to new tasks and distributions. The paper presents a series of experiments demonstrating the advantages of SMN in generalization and fast adaptation capabilities over conventional models and routing strategies.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Contribution**: The introduction of the SMN framework and the agreement router presents a significant advancement in modular neural networks. The focus on adaptive learning and the ability to incorporate new modules without extensive retraining is particularly relevant in the current landscape of machine learning where transfer learning and adaptability are critical.

2. **Well-Structured Framework**: The structure of the paper is clear and well-organized. The authors effectively describe the motivation, methodology, and implications of their approach. The use of an introduction segment that connects cognitive processes in humans to machine learning strategies enhances the reader's understanding of the significance of modular networks.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The experimental validation involves well-defined tasks, including a toy problem and a more complex few-shot image classification task. The reported results are convincing, showing that SMN outperforms baseline models in multiple scenarios, reflecting the framework's practical applications.

4. **Theoretical Justification**: The paper includes a theoretical analysis that supports the effectiveness of the agreement routing mechanism, particularly the claim that it encourages sparsity in module selection, which is crucial for avoiding trivial solutions in routing.

5. **Open Access to Code**: The provision of access to the SMN code on GitHub encourages reproducibility, which is paramount in scientific research and enables other researchers to build upon the work presented.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Range of Experiments**: Although the authors conduct experiments on a toy problem and few-shot learning, the generalization to other complex real-world scenarios (e.g., handling diverse datasets in different domains) could be explored more rigorously. Additional comparisons with state-of-the-art methods in various domains would strengthen the paper's claims about SMN's advantages.

2. **Lack of Ablation Studies**: The paper does not seem to present a comprehensive set of ablation studies to ascertain the individual contributions of different components of the framework, such as the agreement router versus traditional routing methods. Such studies could clarify the importance and effectiveness of each element.

3. **Scalability and Computational Load**: While the authors mention that the framework supports adding new modules, there is limited discussion on the computational implications of integrating a large number of modules, particularly regarding training time and computational load. A more in-depth analysis of these aspects could provide better insights into the practical applicability of SMN in large-scale applications.

4. **Theoretical Foundation**: The theoretical proofs, while interesting, could use additional clarification and context for readers who may not have a strong background in the mathematical formulation presented. More intuitive explanations alongside formal ones could make the concepts more accessible.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a novel and promising approach to improving modular neural networks through the SMN framework. It addresses important challenges related to adaptive learning and the integration of new modules, making it a valuable contribution to the field of machine learning. Addressing the identified weaknesses in future work would enhance the paper's impact and applicability. 

**Recommendation:** Accept with minor revisions.
