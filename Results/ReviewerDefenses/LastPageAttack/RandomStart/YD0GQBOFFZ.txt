### Review of "Structured Evaluation of Synthetic Tabular Data"

#### Summary
The paper proposes a comprehensive framework for evaluating synthetic tabular data based on the premise that synthetic data should be drawn from the same distribution as observed data. It aims to unify existing metrics under a coherent mathematical framework, examining the completeness and coherence of these metrics. This structured evaluation facilitates the assessment of various data synthesizers, including those based on deep learning and other statistical methods. Through experiments on diverse datasets, the authors demonstrate that synthesizers explicitly modeling tabular data structure outperform those using implicit representations, particularly in cases with limited data.

#### Strengths
1. **Novelty and Contribution**: The establishment of a structured evaluation framework for synthetic tabular data is a significant contribution. By framing all metrics around a mathematical objective, the paper enhances the clarity and interpretability of the evaluation process.
   
2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The paper evaluates a diverse range of synthesizers (eight methods across three datasets) using 32 different metrics. This breadth underscores the robustness of the proposed framework.

3. **Clear Presentation**: The paper is well-organized, with logical transitions between sections. The use of figures and tables to illustrate complex relationships and metrics helps convey the findings to the reader.

4. **Practical Utility**: The open-source implementation of the evaluation framework allows other researchers to apply and extend the proposed methods, fostering further research in synthetic data generation and evaluation.

5. **Empirical Validation**: The results demonstrating the superiority of structure-based synthesizers over deep-learning approaches in certain scenarios provide valuable insights into the landscape of synthetic data generation.

#### Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement
1. **Benchmarking and Comparisons**: While the paper presents a comparative analysis of several synthesizers, it could benefit from more explicit discussions on the limitations of each method, especially those ranking lower in performance. This would enhance understanding of when and why certain synthesizers fail.

2. **Metric Interpretability**: Although the structured framework is mathematically grounded, some readers may find certain metrics' interpretations challenging without further explanation. A detailed discussion of each metric's implications and practical significance could improve accessibility.

3. **Use of Datasets**: The datasets used for evaluation, albeit varying in size and type, may not fully capture the complexity of real-world applications. Incorporating additional datasets with different characteristics, especially those with higher dimensionality, could validate the robustness of the findings.

4. **New Metrics Development**: While the paper introduces a new class of metrics, the specification and theoretical justification for these metrics could be elaborated upon. Providing evidence of their effectiveness compared to established metrics would strengthen the framework.

5. **Experimental Limitations**: The authors should transparently discuss any potential biases or limitations in their experimental setup, such as the computational resources used and the impact of data preprocessing steps. This would allow for informed interpretations of the results.

#### Conclusion
Overall, the paper presents a substantial and innovative advancement in the evaluation of synthetic tabular data, offering a structured and coherent framework for understanding the performance of data synthesizers. While there are areas where further elaboration would enhance the paperâ€™s contributions, the empirical results and comprehensive methodology support the findings well. This work is expected to significantly influence future research directions in synthetic data generation and evaluation, making it a strong candidate for presentation at ICLR 2024.
