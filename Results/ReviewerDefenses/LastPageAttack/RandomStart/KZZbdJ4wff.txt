**Review of "PRO: Pseudo-label Regularized Optimization on Unlabeled Test Data"**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces a novel framework named Pseudo-label Regularized Optimization (PRO) geared toward improving the performance of visual-language (VL) models such as CLIP in test-time training (TTT) scenarios, particularly when only unlabeled test data is available. The authors identify a common failure mode in existing TTT methods—catastrophic collapse—where models tend to converge to trivial solutions due to imbalanced pseudo-label distributions. They propose PRO as a solution to mitigate this collapse without requiring hyperparameter tuning based on validation data. The method demonstrates significant performance improvements across various downstream datasets.

**Strengths:**
1. **Relevance and Timeliness:** The study addresses an important challenge in machine learning related to the adaptation of pretrained models when faced with domain shifts in the absence of labeled data. With the increasing use of foundation models like CLIP in practical applications, this problem is particularly pertinent.
   
2. **Contribution to the Field:** The introduction of PRO marks a significant advance in test-time training methodologies by offering a systematic way to regularize pseudo-labeling strategies without requiring hyperparameter tuning on validation sets. The insights into combining existing techniques from semi-supervised and test-time training paradigms are valuable.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The authors conduct a thorough evaluation of their proposed approach across 18 datasets, which is commendable. The detailed experimental results, including comparisons with prior work (MUST), and ablation studies over different hyperparameters provide a strong empirical foundation for validating their claims.

4. **Generalization Capabilities:** The ability of PRO to generalize across different model architectures, specifically the adaptation from ViT-B-32 to the larger ViT-L-14-336, demonstrates the robustness and scalability of the proposed method.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Theoretical Justification:** While the empirical results are strong, the paper would benefit from a more rigorous theoretical explanation of why the introduced regularization techniques effectively prevent collapse. Exploring the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the stability of PRO could strengthen the manuscript.

2. **Limited Consideration of Hyperparameter Impact:** Although the authors claim that PRO does not require hyperparameter tuning, the experimental results reveal sensitivity to certain hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate and momentum). A more in-depth analysis or discussion of these sensitivities would enhance the clarity of this claim.

3. **Dataset Representation:** While the diversity of datasets is a strength, it also raises questions regarding the representation of edge cases, particularly long-tail distributions. The paper mentions limitations in dataset representation but could elaborate on how these might impact the general applicability of PRO.

4. **Future Directions:** The authors briefly mention potential future work, but a more detailed exploration of possible extensions or enhancements to PRO (e.g., investigating more complex models or real-world applications) could provide a stronger conclusion.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper offers a meaningful contribution to the domain adaptation literature, providing an innovative and practical approach to improve test-time training of foundation models using unlabeled data. The comprehensive evaluations and robust performance make PRO a compelling method for practitioners working with visual-language models. Addressing the noted weaknesses could further enhance the paper's impact and clarity. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to strengthen the theoretical background and address the outlined concerns.
