**Review of "PILOT: A NO(1/K)-CONVERGENT APPROACH FOR POLICY EVALUATION WITH NONLINEAR FUNCTION APPROXIMATION"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel algorithm, PILOT, and its enhanced version, PILOT+, aimed at addressing the challenges associated with policy evaluation (PE) in reinforcement learning (RL) when utilizing nonlinear function approximation. The authors claim that their approach achieves a convergence rate of O(1/K), which is optimal in the context of the literature, along with reduced sample complexity and the ability to maintain constant step sizes. Through extensive numerical experiments, the authors demonstrate the efficacy of their algorithms, providing comparative results against state-of-the-art methods.

**Strengths:**
1. **Original Contribution**: The paper provides substantial advancements in PE with nonlinear function approximation through the development of PILOT and PILOT+. The claim of achieving O(1/K) convergence with constant step sizes is significant and addresses an important gap in the current literature.
  
2. **Theoretical Foundations**: The authors rigorously establish the theoretical foundation for their algorithms, presenting clear assumptions and providing detailed convergence analyses. This extensive theoretical background strengthens the paper's contributions.

3. **Empirical Validation**: The experimental results verify the theoretical claims and demonstrate the superiority of PILOT and PILOT+ over existing approaches, showcasing both faster convergence and lower sample complexity in practical scenarios.

4. **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is well-structured, with a logical flow that guides the reader through the problem definition, theoretical development, and empirical results. The use of tables and figures enhances comprehension and facilitates comparison with existing methods.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity of Assumptions**: While the assumptions laid out in the paper are mathematically sound, some may be overly restrictive or not universally applicable across all RL scenarios. A discussion on the impact of relaxing some assumptions could strengthen the applicability of the presented methods.

2. **Implementation Considerations**: Although the paper claims that PILOT is simpler to implement than two-timescale algorithms, the practical implementation details, such as the tuning of hyperparameters and real-world applicability, could be expanded upon. Concrete guidelines for practitioners would enhance the work's usefulness.

3. **Broader Implications**: While the paper mentions that the techniques developed might be applicable to a broader domain of minimax optimization, the exploration of this potential is somewhat limited. A deeper discussion on these implications could engage a wider audience beyond just reinforcement learning.

4. **Limited Discussion of Limitations**: Although the results are promising, the paper lacks a critical discussion of the limitations of the proposed methods. Addressing potential drawbacks or scenarios where PILOT and PILOT+ may underperform compared to existing methods would provide a balanced perspective.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a significant advancement in policy evaluation for reinforcement learning, with both strong theoretical contributions and empirical results. While it would benefit from some clarifications on assumptions, implementation, and potential limitations, it is a well-written and impactful contribution to the field. I recommend acceptance of this paper for presentation at ICLR 2024, as it would be a valuable addition to the conference and the ongoing discourse in reinforcement learning research.
