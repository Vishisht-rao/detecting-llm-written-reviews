**Review of the Paper: "LIDAR-PTQ: Post-Training Quantization for Point Cloud 3D Object Detection"**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces a novel Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) method named LiDAR-PTQ, specifically designed for 3D LiDAR-based object detection. This method addresses the performance degradation commonly seen when applying conventional quantization techniques to 3D tasks by proposing three main components: a sparsity-based calibration method, a Task-guided Global Positive Loss (TGPL) function, and an adaptive rounding-to-nearest operation. The authors claim that their method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the INT8 model exhibiting accuracy comparable to the FP32 model while providing significant inference speedups.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Contribution:** The paper significantly contributes to the field of 3D object detection by presenting a quantization strategy specifically tailored for the unique characteristics of LiDAR point clouds, such as inherent sparsity and irregular distributions. This focus is timely and relevant given the increasing deployment of machine learning models on edge devices in autonomous vehicles.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The authors conduct extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset and compare their proposed method against several advanced PTQ techniques for 2D RGB-based tasks. The results indicate that LiDAR-PTQ consistently outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.

3. **Practical Implications:** The reported 3× inference speedup and 30× faster quantization process compared to QAT methods make LiDAR-PTQ a practical solution for real-time applications in autonomous systems, potentially leading to wider adoption in industry.

4. **Clear Presentation:** The paper is well-structured, with a logical flow from the problem statement, methodology, and results to conclusions. Key concepts and contributions are highlighted effectively.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Quantitative Analysis of Components:** While the ablation study shows the effectiveness of each component, a more detailed quantitative analysis might provide clearer insights into how each part contributes to the overall accuracy and efficiency of the method. For instance, the exact improvements obtained from the adaptive rounding mechanism would be beneficial to highlight.

2. **Assumption on Label Data:** The paper claims that the proposed method does not require labeled training data for fine-tuning; however, the implications of this assumption could be discussed more explicitly. In real-world scenarios, having access to some form of labeled data, even if limited, could aid in performance, and understanding potential trade-offs would be valuable.

3. **Generality of Approach:** Although the method performs well on the CenterPoint model, it would be insightful to evaluate its performance across a more diverse set of models and datasets to generalize the findings. Considering variations in input data characteristics could strengthen the claims of robustness.

**Technical Quality:**
The technical content of the paper is strong, with rigorous mathematical formulations and a clear description of the proposed methodologies. The experimental design is sound, and the results are presented without any apparent inconsistencies.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, "LIDAR-PTQ: Post-Training Quantization for Point Cloud 3D Object Detection" is a significant and well-executed contribution to the field of 3D object detection, especially concerning the deployment of models on resource-constrained edge devices. The proposed method demonstrates strong performance improvements while being cost-effective. I recommend it for acceptance, with minor revisions to address clarity and expand on certain methodological aspects. 

**Rating: 8/10 – Strong contribution with practicality in real-world implementations.**
