### Review of "BANDITS WITH RANKING FEEDBACK"

#### Summary
The paper presents a novel exploration of a variation of the multi-armed bandit problem termed "bandits with ranking feedback." Unlike traditional multi-armed bandits that provide numeric rewards, this approach allows the learner to rank arms based on their observed performance without quantifying the differences. This is particularly relevant for applications involving human preferences, where exact metrics may be difficult or sensitive to measure.

The authors investigate the design of no-regret algorithms under both stochastic and adversarial settings, demonstrating interesting theoretical results on the limitations imposed by the lack of numerical feedback. The paper discusses two specific algorithms developed for this setting: DREE (Dynamical Ranking Exploration-Exploitation), which achieves a superlogarithmic regret in the instance-dependent case, and R-LPE (Ranking Logarithmic Phased Elimination), which guarantees a regret of \( \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) \) in the instance-independent case. Additionally, they provide empirical evaluations showing these algorithms outperform established baselines.

#### Strengths
1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The exploration of ranking feedback in bandits is innovative and addresses real-world scenarios where direct numeric feedback is not available. This adds a crucial contribution to the bandit literature, particularly in preference learning contexts.

2. **Theoretical Insights**: The authors provide a comprehensive theoretical framework, including lower and upper bounds on regret in various settings. The discussion around the implications of lacking numerical scores is particularly insightful and sheds light on potential limitations of existing algorithms.

3. **Algorithm Development**: The design of two distinct algorithms that fit the different settings (instance-dependent and independent) is well-justified. The algorithms are backed by solid theoretical guarantees, and their performance is evaluated against baseline methods.

4. **Numerical Evaluation**: The empirical results supporting the theoretical claims effectively demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithms. The comparison of DREE and R-LPE with EC provides valuable insights for practitioners.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Clarification on Assumptions**: While the paper delves deep into the implications of the chosen feedback structure, it could benefit from clearer statements regarding the assumptions under which these algorithms achieve their results. For example, what specific conditions or characteristics of the arms impact performance?

2. **Limitations of Experiments**: The numerical evaluation, while robust, primarily focuses on synthetic instances. Additional evaluations on real-world datasets or applications could enhance the validation of the algorithms and illustrate practical applicability.

3. **Complexity Analysis**: Although the paper discusses the performance guarantees, a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms is lacking. This information would be crucial for applications where computational efficiency is a concern.

4. **Related Work Integration**: The paper includes a related works section, but the connection to existing models in more depth could further contextualize the contributions. A clearer comparison between their ranking feedback approach and other robust preference-based learning models would strengthen the positioning of their work.

#### Conclusion
In conclusion, the paper "BANDITS WITH RANKING FEEDBACK" presents a significant advancement in multi-armed bandit theory by successfully addressing a relevant and complex challengeâ€”that of learning from ranking feedback rather than numerical rewards. While the paper has notable strengths in innovation and theoretical contributions, it would benefit from additional empirical validation, clarification of assumptions, and complexity considerations. Overall, this work is a valuable addition to the domain and has the potential for strong impact in related applications. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions focused on the noted weaknesses.
