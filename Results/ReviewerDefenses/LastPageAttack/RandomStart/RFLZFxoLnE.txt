### Review of "Modify Training Direction in Function Space to Reduce Generalization Error"

#### General Comments:
The paper presents an innovative approach to addressing the generalization error in neural networks by introducing a modified natural gradient descent (Modified NGD) method that operates in the function space. The authors leverage the framework of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) to analyze the training dynamics and provide a theoretical basis for modifying the training direction based on the eigenvalues of the Fisher information matrix. They claim that this modification can reduce the generalization error by aligning the training direction with the ground truth distribution of the data. The inclusion of numerical experiments further strengthens their argument.

#### Strengths:
1. **Theoretical Contribution**: The authors provide a solid theoretical foundation for their approach, with clear assumptions that lay the groundwork for their results. The derivation of the generalization error associated with the learned function and the explicit criterion for modification in the eigenspaces of the Fisher information matrix is a notable contribution.

2. **Connection to Existing Work**: The paper effectively connects the proposed Modified NGD framework to existing methods and theories related to generalization error in neural networks, such as self-distillation and cross-domain generalization. This contextualization adds depth to the theoretical insights presented.

3. **Experimental Validation**: The numerical experiments conducted on synthetic datasets and the real-world HTRU2 dataset serve as empirical support for the theoretical claims. The performance improvements of Modified NGD over standard NGD are well-documented, demonstrating its practicality.

4. **Clarity of Presentation**: The paper is well-organized, making a concerted effort to present complex theoretical concepts in a clear and comprehensible manner. The writing is generally precise, and the figures effectively convey the results of the numerical experiments.

#### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Assumptions and Limitations**: While the assumptions are clearly stated, a more detailed discussion of their implications and limitations would enhance the paper. For example, the focus on infinite width networks and specific activation functions might limit the practical applicability of the proposed method to a narrower subset of architectures.

2. **Numerical Experiment Complexity**: The numerical experiments, while informative, could be expanded to include more complex network architectures and datasets. The reliance on a two-layer MLP in synthetic experiments may not fully capture the challenges present in more intricate, realistic scenarios. Including experiments with architectures commonly used in practice (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks) could provide further insights into the robustness of the proposed method.

3. **Computational Efficiency**: A discussion on the computational cost involved in implementing the Modified NGD compared to standard approaches would be beneficial. The additional overhead associated with calculating and modifying the Fisher information matrix may impact the scalability of the proposed approach.

4. **Clarification of Criteria**: While the criteria for modification based on the eigenvalues of the Fisher information matrix are presented, further clarification and potential analysis of how different criterion choices may impact performance could enrich the paper. Additionally, providing examples or case studies to illustrate the application of the criteria in practice would aid understanding.

#### Conclusion:
The paper presents an interesting and innovative approach to reducing generalization error in neural networks through Modified NGD. It effectively combines theoretical insights with practical numerical experiments, making a valuable contribution to the field. However, addressing the limitations and expanding on the computational aspects and practical applicability of the method would further enhance the paper's impact. Overall, this work is worthy of publication with minor revisions and refinements.
