### Review of "Optimal Multiple Transport with Applications to Visual Matching, Model Fusion and Beyond"

#### Summary
This paper presents a novel framework called Optimal Multiple Transportation (OMT), which generalizes traditional Optimal Transport (OT) by enabling the mapping of multiple probability measures, with a focus on ensuring cycle-consistency among these mappings. The authors derive both Monge and Kantorovich formulations for the OMT problem, propose a regularized iterative algorithm, ROMT-Sinkhorn, and demonstrate the applicability of their approach in visual multi-point matching (MPM) and multi-model fusion (MMF), along with a novel formulation for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Empirical results indicate that the proposed methods achieve competitive performance relative to existing techniques.

#### Strengths
1. **Innovative Contribution**: The introduction of OMT represents a significant advancement beyond traditional pairwise OT approaches, effectively addressing problems in real-world applications that involve more than two distributions.
  
2. **Theoretical Foundations**: The rigorous formulation of both Monge and Kantorovich versions of OMT is a strong point, with clear definitions and constraints provided, including the cycle-consistency conditions.

3. **Algorithm Development**: The proposed ROMT-Sinkhorn algorithm effectively integrates entropic and cycle-consistency regularization, demonstrating a thoughtful approach to addressing the computational challenges associated with OMT.

4. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The paper presents empirical results on two different tasks (MPM and MMF), showcasing a thorough evaluation of the proposed method's effectiveness and robustness. The inclusion of multiple comparisons with state-of-the-art methods lends credibility to the findings.

5. **Promising Extensions**: The exploration of a connection between OMT and the TSP provides an interesting dimension and potential for future research directions.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Complexity of the Method**: The addition of hyperparameters in the ROMT-Sinkhorn algorithm introduces complexity. The tuning process of these hyperparameters could be challenging and may not be well established, leading to a potential barrier for practical application.

2. **Comparative Baselines**: While the authors compare their method to several existing techniques, a deeper analysis of these comparisons would strengthen the validity of their performance claims. Specifically, an examination of computational efficiency and scalability relative to classical methods could provide more insights.

3. **Generality of Applications**: While the paper claims broad applicability (e.g., MPM, MMF, and TSP), further examples or case studies beyond the presented applications would help in showcasing the versatility of OMT.

4. **Limitations and Future Work**: The limitations mentioned, such as the inability to guarantee a closed-loop solution in the TSP context, should be better contextualized within the broader implications for the effectiveness of the proposed methods. A more detailed discussion on potential strategies to address these limitations would enhance the paper's conclusion.

5. **Clarification and Organization**: Some sections of the paper could benefit from greater clarity in exposition, particularly in the introduction and methodology. Improved organization could facilitate reader understanding, especially in distinguishing between theoretical derivations and algorithmic implementations.

#### Conclusion
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution in the realm of Optimal Transport, offering a compelling new framework and algorithm for dealing with multiple probability measures while ensuring key constraints. The rigorous theoretical development and empirical validation presented establish a strong foundation for this work, though there are areas for improvement regarding hyperparameter management, comparative analysis, and clarity. If the authors address these issues, this work could be of considerable impact in areas related to machine learning and optimization.
