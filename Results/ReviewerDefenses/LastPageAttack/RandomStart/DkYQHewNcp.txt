### Review of "Unsupervised Detection of Recurrent Patterns in Neural Recordings with Constrained Filters"

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel unsupervised method for detecting recurrent patterns in neural recordings using constrained spatiotemporal filters optimized through backpropagation. The authors highlight the significance of their approach in analyzing spontaneous neural activity, particularly in the context of hippocampal place cell sequences. The proposed method demonstrates impressive scalability and speed compared to existing techniques, promising new avenues for researchers needing to analyze larger datasets.

**Strengths:**
1. **Scalability and Speed:** The authors convincingly demonstrate that their method significantly outperforms existing techniques, managing to process large datasets over 100 times faster than comparable methods. This is particularly important in the field of neuroscience, where the size of datasets is continually increasing.
  
2. **Uncertainty Estimation:** The introduction of uncertainty estimates without requiring multiple optimization runs is a notable contribution that adds rigor to the potential interpretations of detected patterns.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper includes thorough evaluations across synthetic datasets exhibiting controlled conditions and real datasets that highlight the practical utility of the method in detecting relevant neural patterns. The inclusion of multiple experiments enhances the credibility of the findings.

4. **Theoretical Contributions:** The introduction of the dual formulation—direct filter optimization and the parameterization as truncated Gaussians—is innovative and provides flexibility that can be adapted based on the underlying data characteristics.

5. **Clear Results Presentation:** Figures and descriptions are well-organized, improving the reader's understanding of the methodology and results. The paper successfully illustrates how the method captures complex neural activity patterns.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Assumptions on Patterns:** As acknowledged by the authors, the method requires prior knowledge of the number and approximate duration of sequences. This could limit its applicability in scenarios where such information is not available or reliable.

2. **Potential Overfitting:** While the benchmarks of performance are impressive, there are concerns about the model’s risk of overfitting, particularly in scenarios with overlapping or rare sequences. Further exploration of robustness to noise and variability in real-world datasets would strengthen the findings.

3. **Limited Generalizability:** While results are encouraging, the experiments mostly focus on synthetic and specific real datasets. The paper would benefit from exploring a wider variety of datasets, especially those with more complex and variable patterns, to evaluate the robustness and generalizability of the method.

4. **Parameter Sensitivity:** The paper discusses the importance of hyperparameter selection (like K and M), but more guidance or automated methods for choosing these parameters would enhance accessibility for practical use. Empirical strategies are mentioned, but more systematic approaches might be warranted.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- **Include more empirical results** from diverse datasets where patterns display varying degrees of complexity and sparsity. This would bolster claims around the method's robustness and versatility.
- **Consider elaborate discussions** on potential methods for parameter tuning and sensitivity analysis to aid researchers in adopting this method without extensive parameter optimization efforts.
- **Investigate the effects of noise** in synthetic datasets to better understand the limits of the model in real-like scenarios, as well as the implications of using synthetic data for training/evaluation.

**Conclusion:**
This paper makes a significant contribution to the analysis of recurrent patterns in neural recordings, presenting a method that is not only faster but also gives uncertainty estimates in detection. While there are areas for refinement, particularly concerning generalizability and robustness under varying conditions, the work is promising and has the potential to advance the field of computational neuroscience significantly. I recommend this paper for acceptance after addressing the mentioned concerns.
