**Review of "STIMULUS: Achieving Fast Convergence and Low Sample Complexity in Stochastic Multi-Objective Learning"**

**Summary:**
The paper proposes a novel algorithm named STIMULUS (stochastic path-integrated multi-gradient recursive estimator) to tackle the challenges associated with multi-objective optimization (MOO). The authors argue that existing MOO algorithms often suffer from convergence issues and propose STIMULUS as a solution that effectively reduces variance in multi-gradient estimation, thereby improving convergence performance and lowering sample complexity. The paper also introduces an enhanced version, STIMULUS-M, which incorporates momentum to expedite convergence. The authors provide extensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating convergence rates and sample complexities that are advantageous compared to existing methods. Furthermore, they present comprehensive experimental results that validate the effectiveness of their proposed algorithms.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty**: The introduction of STIMULUS and its variants represents a significant contribution to the field of multi-objective optimization, particularly given the need for efficient algorithms capable of handling large datasets and multiple objectives. The recursive variance reduction technique is innovative and addresses inherent challenges in MOO.
  
2. **Theoretical Contributions**: The paper provides rigorous theoretical analyses for both the basic and enhanced versions of the STIMULUS algorithm. Establishing O(1/T) convergence rates for non-convex objectives and O(exp(-ÂµT)) for strongly convex objectives is a noteworthy achievement, as is the substantial reduction in sample complexity.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The authors validate their theoretical claims with extensive experiments across various datasets and objective functions. The comparison against several state-of-the-art algorithms highlights the practical advantages of STIMULUS and its enhanced variants. The use of various datasets (MultiMNIST, river flow prediction, and CelebA) adds robustness to the experimental results.

4. **Clarity and Organization**: The paper is well-organized, with a clear structure that effectively guides the reader through the problem statement, method development, theoretical analysis, and experimental validation.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity**: While the paper discusses how STIMULUS improves upon existing methods, the complexity of the proposed methodology may limit its accessibility. Readers without a strong background in stochastic optimization might struggle to grasp the nuances of the algorithm.

2. **Assumptions on Objective Functions**: The paper relies on several assumptions (L-smoothness, bounded variance, and strong convexity) that may not hold in more general settings. While these assumptions are common in optimization literature, sensitivity analysis regarding the impact of these assumptions on performance could benefit the discussion.

3. **Implementation Concerns**: The complexity of the algorithm, particularly the double-loop structure and the dependence on adaptive batching, may raise practical concerns regarding implementation efficiency and the trade-offs involved in choosing parameters like q.

4. **Comparison to Other Algorithms**: While the authors compare STIMULUS to prominent methods, additional discussion around the limitations of these comparisons would strengthen the paper. For instance, exploring why certain algorithms are favored in practice despite their theoretical shortcomings could provide deeper insights into the field.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, "STIMULUS: Achieving Fast Convergence and Low Sample Complexity in Stochastic Multi-Objective Learning" makes a significant contribution to the field of multi-objective optimization. The proposed algorithm is well-justified through theoretical analysis and empirical validation, marking it as a promising approach for future research and application. However, clarity regarding the practical implementation and a more detailed discussion around assumptions could enhance the paper's impact. Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions.
