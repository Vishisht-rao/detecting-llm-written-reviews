OUTPUT:
**Review of the Paper: "On-Policy Distillation of Language Models: Learning From Self-Generated Mistakes"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a new framework called Generalized Knowledge Distillation (GKD) designed to improve the distillation of language models, specifically addressing the challenges associated with on-policy knowledge distillation for auto-regressive models. The authors identify a critical issue: the distribution mismatch that occurs between the output sequences seen during the training phase and those generated by the student model during inference. They propose an innovative approach that leverages feedback from a teacher model on sequences generated by the student itself, thereby mitigating distribution mismatch and improving distillation outcomes across various generative tasks.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty of the Approach:**
   The introduction of GKD is a significant contribution to the field, as it bridges the concepts of knowledge distillation and imitation learning, thus allowing the student model to learn from its own errors through interaction with the teacher. This synergy is a meaningful advancement that addresses previous limitations in existing distillation techniques.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation:**
   The authors provide extensive empirical validation of GKD across multiple downstream tasksâ€”summarization, translation, and arithmetic reasoning. Results indicate that GKD consistently outperforms existing baseline methods, including supervised KD and SeqKD, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.

3. **Flexibility of Divergence Measures:**
   The ability to optimize various divergence measures, such as forward KL, reverse KL, and generalized JSD, adds depth to the proposed method. This flexibility opens up avenues for task-specific optimization, enhancing performance while also allowing for exploration of the performance-diversity trade-offs.

4. **Systematic Analysis and Insights:**
   The authors present a thorough investigation into the impact of different choices made within the GKD framework. Apart from demonstrating improved performance, they offer practical insights into how student-generated data and the selection of divergence measures can affect model outcomes. This systematic approach strengthens the paper's findings and provides valuable guidance for future research.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Technical Complexity:**
   While the novelty is commendable, the introduction of GKD and its associated mechanisms may be overly complex for some audiences. A more intuitive articulation of the key concepts, perhaps with simpler illustrations or examples, might enhance understanding among a broader research community.

2. **Limited Discussion on Computational Efficiency:**
   The paper mentions the computational overhead involved when training models with GKD but does not provide an in-depth analysis of the trade-offs in terms of computational costs compared to established distillation methods. A detailed discussion on scalability in practical implementations would provide clarity on the practical applicability of GKD in real-world scenarios.

3. **Further Real-World Application Insights:**
   Although the proposed method shows empirical success, additional insights or case studies concerning how GKD might behave in real-world applications would yield a greater understanding of its utility. Discussing potential limitations or challenges when deploying this approach in practice would provide a valuable perspective.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper presents a highly relevant and impactful advancement in knowledge distillation for language models. The introduction of GKD effectively addresses a critical issue of distribution mismatch, showing promising results across various tasks. While the complexity may present challenges for some readers, the foundational contributions of this work are substantial and have the potential to influence future distillation methodologies significantly. I recommend acceptance of this paper with suggestions for clearer articulations of complex ideas and a deeper exploration of computational impacts.
