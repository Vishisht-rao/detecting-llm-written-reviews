### Review of "TURING COMPLETE TRANSFORMERS: TWO TRANSFORMERS ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN ONE"

#### Summary
The submitted paper proposes a novel architecture, named Find+Replace transformers, which asserts a theoretical and practical advancement over traditional transformer models by demonstrating Turing completeness. The authors claim that their architecture can perform complex computations unattainable by single transformers and achieves superior performance on a suite of challenging tasks compared to GPT-4. The paper comprises a significant theoretical component that includes a demonstration of why traditional transformers lack Turing completeness, and provides an empirical evaluation of the proposed architecture against existing large language models (LLMs).

#### Strengths
1. **Theoretical Foundations**: The paper provides a rigorous proof that standard transformer architectures are not Turing complete. This foundational analysis is well-researched, offering insightful comparisons with known complexity classes and highlighting problems that transformers cannot effectively generalize.
   
2. **Introduction of Find+Replace Architecture**: The introduction of the Find+Replace transformers represents a creative approach to enhancing the capabilities of traditional transformers by leveraging a multi-transformer configuration. The design and functionality described show promise for advancing the field.

3. **Empirical Results**: The authors provide experimental results demonstrating that Find+Replace transformers outperform GPT-4 and other models in specific tasks, including the Tower of Hanoi problem and composition challenge problems. These results appear robust and contribute to the claims of the architecture's enhanced capabilities.

4. **Interdisciplinary Approach**: By discussing the implications of Turing completeness for the development of AI agents and the potential integration of traditional computer science principles, the paper bridges the gap between theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.

5. **Comprehensive Literature Review**: The paper effectively summarizes existing work on transformers and Turing completeness, situating its contributions within a broader context.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Complexity of the Arguments**: While the theoretical proof is a strength, it could also be a barrier for readers less familiar with computational complexity theory. The presentation of proof may benefit from clearer explanations and examples to serve a broader audience.

2. **Limited Experimental Scope**: The experiments, while convincing, are primarily focused on a few specific tasks. A broader range of tests across diverse applications would strengthen validation of the architecture's generalizability and robustness. Moreover, the current results may not definitively prove the superiority of the proposed model across various natural language processing (NLP) and other domains beyond those tested.

3. **Potential Overhead of Multi-Transformer Systems**: The implementation of multi-transformer systems raises questions about the efficiency and scalability of such architectures. The paper could address how the increased complexity in architecture affects training times and resource consumption, as well as how these factors might limit practical applications.

4. **Comparison with Other Architectures**: While the paper compares Find+Replace transformers to GPT-4, it could further benefit from an analysis of how it fares against other emerging models, such as those utilizing advanced memory mechanisms or different architectural designs. Including more baseline comparisons might enhance the reader's understanding of the model's advantages and limitations.

5. **Technical Jargon and Presentation**: Some sections of the paper contain significant jargon and are densely packed with theoretical concepts, making them potentially less accessible to readers from applied backgrounds. A more simplified exposition of key concepts, perhaps with a dedicated appendix or supplementary material, could enhance clarity.

#### Conclusion
Overall, this paper presents a bold and innovative approach to the limitations of traditional transformer architectures through the introduction of Find+Replace transformers. It makes a substantial contribution to the understanding of computational limits in NLP models and suggests a pathway toward more capable systems. However, the complexities of the proposed proofs and the range of empirical evaluations invite further elaboration to ensure that the findings are broadly applicable and digestible for a wider audience. The authors are encouraged to consider these points in their revision to maximize the impact of their research.
