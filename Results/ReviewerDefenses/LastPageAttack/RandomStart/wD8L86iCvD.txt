**Review of "FINE-GRAINED AUDIO-VISUAL JOINT REPRESENTATIONS FOR MULTIMODAL LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel framework called FA VOR (Fine-Grained Audio-Visual Joint Representation Learning) for enhancing multimodal large language models (LLMs) with fine-grained audio-visual understanding capabilities. The proposed framework aims to capture causal relationships between audio and visual inputs at the frame level, addressing the limitations of existing models that treat audio and video inputs independently or with coarse sampling. FA VOR incorporates a causal Q-Former structure and introduces a benchmark called the Audio-Visual Evaluation Benchmark (A VEB) to assess multimodal reasoning abilities.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach:** The proposed FA VOR framework significantly contributes to the field of multimodal LLMs by addressing the gap in fine-grained audio-visual reasoning. The introduction of the causal Q-Former structure that leverages causal attention is a notable advancement.

2. **Comprehensive Benchmark:** The creation of the Audio-Visual Evaluation Benchmark (A VEB) provides a systematic way to evaluate models in single-modal and cross-modal tasks, which is crucial for driving further research in multimodal understanding.

3. **Competitive Results:** The experimental results showcase that FA VOR achieves state-of-the-art performance in several tasks, including superior results on cross-modal tasks, signaling a critical advance in audio-visual co-reasoning capabilities.

4. **Detailed Experimental Setup and Analysis:** The paper provides a thorough methodological section and ablation studies that clearly elucidate the contributions of different components of the framework, reinforcing the validity of the approach.

5. **Emergent Abilities:** The articulation of emergent capabilities, such as audio-visual co-reasoning, adds depth to the findings and illustrates the practical application of the model in real-world scenarios.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity and Clarity:** The paper is dense with information and may be challenging to follow for readers not already familiar with the intricacies of multimodal learning and the specific methodologies employed. Some sections could benefit from clearer explanations or visual aids to improve comprehension.

2. **Generalizability of Results:** While the model performs exceptionally on the provided benchmark, the paper could discuss the limitations in generalizing these findings to unseen domains or diverse real-world data. Further exploration into the model's adaptability across different modalities and configurations may enhance the contribution.

3. **Ethical Considerations:** The ethical implications of deploying such models, especially regarding potential biases in audio-visual data representation, could be elaborated further. A more extensive consideration of these factors would strengthen the discussion on responsible AI design.

4. **Comparison with Recent Models:** Although the authors mention existing models such as Video-LLaMA and Macaw-LLM, a more detailed comparative analysis with recent advancements could enrich the context of FA VOR's contributions.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper presents significant advancements in the capabilities of multimodal LLMs through fine-grained audio-visual representation learning. The proposed FA VOR framework, supported by extensive experimental results and the introduction of the A VEB benchmark, marks an important contribution to the field. While the complexity of the exposition and broader implications are areas for improvement, the paper holds great potential for future research and application in multimodal AI systems. I recommend acceptance for the conference, contingent on addressing the aforementioned concerns.
