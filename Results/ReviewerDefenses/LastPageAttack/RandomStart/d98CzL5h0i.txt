### Review of "LEARNING TO GENERATE BETTER THAN YOUR LLM"

#### Summary
The paper proposes a novel framework, Reinforcement Learning with Guided Feedback (RLGF), for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL). The authors argue that the traditional supervised learning (SL) approaches face challenges due to metric mismatches, and introduce RLGF as an alternative that leverages a guide large language model to improve the efficiency and performance of RL-based fine-tuning methods. The framework integrates various RL algorithms, including modifications of PPO, to facilitate better performance in tasks such as sentiment analysis, constrained text generation, and summarization.

#### Strengths
1. **Innovative Approach**: The introduction of the RLGF framework is timely and addresses a critical gap in the literature by examining RL strategies that build on the capabilities of existing LLMs as guides. This has the potential to enhance model performance in practical applications.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The authors provide detailed empirical results across three distinct NLP tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of RLGF in outperforming both SL and traditional RL methods like PPO. The quantitative metrics reported, including various lexical and semantic scores, give a strong backing to their claims.

3. **Theoretical Justification**: A substantial portion of the paper is dedicated to theoretical underpinnings. The reasoning provided for the benefits of their approach is carefully articulated, enhancing the overall credibility of the proposed methods.

4. **Clear Write-Up**: The manuscript is generally well-organized, with clearly defined sections and logical flow. Mathematical formulations are presented clearly, allowing for reader comprehension, which is crucial for a technical audience.

5. **Potential for Broader Contribution**: By framing the problem in the context of RL and IL and focusing on a more guided approach, the findings could pave the way for future research at the intersection of RL and NLP, including enhanced reward structures and exploration techniques.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Dependence on Guide LLM Performance**: While leveraging a guide policy is a key component of this work, there are inherent risks. The effectiveness of RLGF is contingent on the performance and characteristics of the guide LLM used. If the guide model is poorly tuned, the resulting outputs could be suboptimal, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.

2. **Limited Comparisons**: The paper primarily compares RLGF to vanilla PPO and supervised learning baselines. A comparison with more recent methodologies, including innovative RLHF strategies or other state-of-the-art fine-tuning techniques, would provide a more comprehensive view of the effectiveness of RLGF.

3. **Complexity of Implementation**: The introduction of multiple algorithms (PPO++, AggreVaTeD, D2LOLS) within the RLGF framework could make implementation complex. Real-world applications require an accessible approach, and the paper could provide clearer guidance on selecting and implementing the most suitable algorithm for specific tasks.

4. **Experimentation on Synthetic/Real Data**: While the tasks chosen (IMDB, CommonGen, TL;DR) are well-justified, the authors should address whether their findings would hold in more nuanced settings, where prompts might not closely adhere to the training data distributions.

5. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: The experiments concerning the sensitivity of hyperparameters, particularly the KL and MLE coefficients, suggest that the methods may require careful tuning. The broader implications for scalability and ease of deployment should be discussed.

#### Conclusion
In conclusion, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of NLP by proposing a novel framework that leverages reinforcement learning with guided feedback mechanisms. It provides theoretical and empirical support for the effectiveness of this approach. However, to strengthen the findings, broader comparisons to current methodologies and insights into practical deployment would be beneficial. With these considerations addressed, the work has the potential to significantly impact subsequent research and practical applications in fine-tuning large language models. 

#### Recommendation
I recommend acceptance of this paper for presentation at ICLR 2024 pending minor revisions to address the concerns raised.
