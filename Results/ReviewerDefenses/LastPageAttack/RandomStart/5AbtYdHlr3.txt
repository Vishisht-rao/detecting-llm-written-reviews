### Review of "Stochastic Safe Action Model Learning"

#### Summary
The paper presents an innovative approach to learning stochastic action models for planning in environments with probabilistic dynamics. The authors aim to develop a learning algorithm that can capture the stochastic effects of actions while ensuring safety and approximate completeness, expanding on previous work that assumed independence of effects on individual fluents.

The proposed algorithm is notable for its polynomial time and sample complexity, alongside guarantees that only allow actions to be executed in states where the learned model accurately reflects the true dynamics. The methodology revolves around using tensor decompositions and the method of moments, addressing the challenges of learning in environments characterized by stochasticity.

#### Strengths
1. **Novel Contribution**: The paper addresses an important gap in the existing literature regarding the learning of action models in stochastic environments without the independence assumption. This contributes significantly to the field of automated planning and learning.
   
2. **Strong Theoretical Foundations**: The authors provide rigorous theoretical guarantees concerning the safety and approximate completeness of their approach. This is crucial for applications where making erroneous decisions can lead to unsafe outcomes.

3. **Clear Structure and Writing**: The paper is well-structured, with a clear progression from the introduction through to the technical details and related work. The authors also provide sufficient motivation and context for their proposed method, making it accessible to readers unfamiliar with the specific research area.

4. **Comprehensive Related Work**: The related work section is thorough, citing several relevant studies and positioning the current research within the broader body of literature. Notably, the discussion of prior approaches highlights the novelty of the proposed algorithm.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Complexity of Presentation**: Sections, particularly those detailing the tensor decomposition methods and algorithmic implementation, can be dense and complex. Further simplification or the inclusion of illustrative examples could enhance readability and comprehension.

2. **Empirical Evaluation**: While the theoretical foundations are robust, the paper lacks substantial empirical validation of the proposed methods. Demonstrating the performance of the algorithm on various benchmark problems and comparing it against existing techniques would strengthen the contribution and applicability of the work.

3. **Assumptions on Data Quality**: The paper assumes that provided trajectories come from competent performance. It would be beneficial to discuss potential issues related to noise and inaccuracies in the data and how they might affect the learning process.

4. **Computational Scalability**: While polynomial time complexity is guaranteed, a more in-depth discussion on the scalability of the algorithm with respect to the number of actions and fluents would be useful. This would enable readers to better understand the practical limitations of deploying this method in more complex domains.

#### Recommendations
- **Empirical Experiments**: Include experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on real or synthetic domains to validate the theoretical claims and showcase practical performance.
  
- **Simplification of Technical Content**: Provide additional explanations, illustrations, or simpler examples, especially in sections discussing the tensor decomposition and algorithm details, to enhance clarity.

- **Explore Robustness to Data Quality**: Discuss the implications of data quality on the learning process and consider presenting strategies to handle noisy or inaccurate data.

#### Conclusion
Overall, "Stochastic Safe Action Model Learning" is a significant contribution to the field of automated planning under uncertainty. It introduces a robust theoretical framework for learning stochastic models in a safe manner. Addressing the above weaknesses would enhance the paper's impact and usability in practical scenarios. I recommend accepting it for presentation at the conference, with suggestions for revisions based on the points raised.
