This study investigates a crucial area in reinforcement learning (RL) aimed at improving sample efficiency through pre-training goal-based models. It tackles a significant challenge in RL: exploring and attaining positive rewards in complex, long-horizon tasks typical of real-world situations.

The authors introduce PTGM (Pre-Training Goal-based Models), enhancing RL with temporal abstractions and behavior regularization by pre-training goal-conditioned policies. Their approach clusters goals to create a discrete high-level action space and incorporates a goal prior model for regularization. These innovations address the challenge of a high-dimensional goal space while ensuring skill diversity.

The experimental validation is thorough, featuring environments like Kitchen for robotic tasks and Minecraft for open-world gaming. The results demonstrate that PTGM outperforms current methods such as SPiRL, TACO, and VPT-finetune in sample efficiency and task performance, affirming the study’s effectiveness claims. The inclusion of ablation studies further substantiates the contribution of each PTGM component to the outcomes.

The paper is well-structured, offering a comprehensive review of related work and clearly detailing the problem formulation, methods, and experimental setups. The extensive goal space clustering and pretrained goal prior contribute significant innovation and promise to goal-conditioned RL practices.

Despite its strengths, some limitations should be recognized. The use of task-agnostic datasets biases the learned skills toward behaviors present in the data. Additionally, the paper does not delve deeply into environments with vastly different dynamics or obscure or rare goal representations outside the dataset's scope.

As the authors suggest, future work could incorporate larger datasets to enhance general skill capabilities and explore improved state representations. These efforts would further confirm PTGM’s adaptability and support its use across a broader array of RL tasks.

Overall, this paper represents a significant advancement in RL, especially in areas where task complexity and data scarcity have historically hindered progress.
