PARAPHRASED OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the challenge of enhancing active learning methods for linear regression, particularly in scenarios with adversarial noise. The authors introduce a new sampling strategy that utilizes dependent leverage score sampling to boost the precision and efficiency of active learning. A key innovation is the use of pivotal sampling, a non-independent technique crafted to enhance spatial coverage in the sampled data set. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated through experiments with problems in parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) and uncertainty quantification, where it's claimed to reduce the required number of samples by up to 50% compared to independent sampling techniques.

The paper is well-organized, starting with an introduction and a clear explanation of leverage scores, followed by an in-depth discussion of the pivotal sampling method. The authors underpin their approach with two main theoretical contributions: extending subspace embedding results to non-independent sampling methods, and providing improved sample complexity bounds for polynomial regression scenarios.

Strengths:
1. **Innovation and Importance**: The new method, which merges leverage score sampling with spatial strategies, tackles the crucial challenge of sample distribution in active learning.
2. **Strong Theoretical Support**: The method benefits from a solid theoretical foundation, including an extension of matrix Chernoff bounds and a fresh analysis of polynomial regression issues.
3. **Applied Benefits**: The method effectively addresses the cost reduction of samples in PDE applications, demonstrating its practical utility.
4. **Thorough Experiments**: The extensive experimental validation supports the claimed advantages across different test problems.

Weaknesses:
1. **Implementation Complexity**: Despite claims of easy implementation, the binary-tree-based pivotal sampling might pose computational hurdles that are not fully explored in the paper.
2. **Scalability Issues**: While focused on low-dimensional data, the paper could more fully address how the method scales to high-dimensional or very large data sets.
3. **Lack of Comparisons with Non-randomized Techniques**: More insights could be gained by comparing this method to deterministic grid-based approaches, beyond its benefits over Bernoulli leverage score sampling.

In summary, the paper makes a significant contribution to active learning under the agnostic setting by introducing a potentially sample-efficient method that maintains or enhances accuracy. The theoretical insights are impressive, and the experimental results are promising, presenting a compelling case for using pivotal sampling strategies in similar learning contexts. Further optimization of computational elements and testing on a broader range of cases would strengthen the method's applicability and robustness.
