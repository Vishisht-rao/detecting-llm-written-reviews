This paper addresses a crucial issue in the analysis of dynamic graphs: managing distribution shifts by introducing a new method termed Curriculum Dynamic Graph Invariant Learning (CDGIL). The authors note that current dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) often have difficulty with distribution shifts, which are common in real-world applications. They propose employing curriculum learning strategies to overcome these challenges, a novel approach that incorporates training progress and sample significance, aspects often neglected by traditional methods.

The paper thoroughly investigates the CDGIL methodology, detailing its multiple components, including a dual disentangled dynamic attention network designed to identify invariant and variant patterns, a self-paced intervention mechanism to reduce the impact of changing patterns, and a curriculum-based reweighting strategy for sample importance. The authors elaborate on the design and implementation of these components, highlighting the innovative integration of curriculum learning into dynamic graph invariant learning.

The evaluation section, featuring tests on both synthetic and real-world datasets, effectively showcases the advantages of the proposed method over existing top-tier baselines. The findings indicate that CDGIL consistently outperforms other methods in settings with distribution shifts. This is a noteworthy achievement, illustrating that CDGIL not only handles distribution shifts more efficiently but also offers better generalization in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios.

However, the paper could enhance clarity or justification in some areas. While the complexity analysis offers a theoretical perspective, it lacks a detailed discussion on practical computational efficiency or resource constraints during training. An examination of scalability and efficiency, especially for large-scale applications, would be advantageous.

Moreover, although ablation studies are included, more detailed insights into hyperparameter tuning and sensitivity analyses could clarify how different parameters influence model performance. Additionally, while the dual disentangled dynamic attention network is a novel aspect, more comparisons with similar methods could strengthen the rationale for its use over other possible architectures.

Finally, the paper could be improved by better linking the theoretical findings with practical implications. Offering clearer explanations or examples of how curriculum learning principles are integrated with invariant pattern learning could make the proposed approach more understandable for readers.

In conclusion, this paper introduces a persuasive method, CDGIL, to address distribution shifts in dynamic graphs, significantly contributing to the field of dynamic graph representation learning. It effectively identifies a gap in existing research and offers a complex solution supported by extensive experimentation and analysis.
