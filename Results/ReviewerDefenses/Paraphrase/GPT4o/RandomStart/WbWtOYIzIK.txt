This paper investigates the enhancement of large language models (LLMs) using a modular system called KNOWLEDGE CARD, aimed at filling gaps in static, general-purpose models. The research is an important look into how LLMs can be enriched with knowledge from collaborative and modular sources by incorporating specialized smaller language models, referred to as "knowledge cards." These targeted models, which are trained on specific domain datasets, function as adaptable information hubs that can be added to larger LLMs to supply them with necessary background information during inference.

The authors point out several notable weaknesses of current LLMs, such as their struggle to integrate new and accurate information frequently, challenges in updating parametric knowledge, and issues with producing outputs that are both relevant and concise. KNOWLEDGE CARD aims to tackle these challenges by using three content selectors—relevance, brevity, and factuality—to sift through and improve the information generated by these specialized models.

The paper describes two primary strategies for integrating the curated knowledge: bottom-up and top-down. The bottom-up approach allows for the blending of multi-domain knowledge but risks including irrelevant data. In contrast, the top-down approach gives the LLM the ability to dynamically assess when external knowledge is needed.

Through detailed experiments, the paper demonstrates that the KNOWLEDGE CARD framework surpasses existing methods in tasks demanding intensive knowledge, showing significant performance enhancements across multiple benchmarks. These include MMLU for general QA, misinformation detection, and the new MIDTERM QA dataset, which tests LLMs' capacity to update temporal knowledge.

The article effectively argues for the creation of modular and cooperative systems that allow for ongoing knowledge updates through contributions from the research community. It envisions KNOWLEDGE CARD as a means to leverage community-driven initiatives to boost the knowledge abilities of LLMs while minimizing the environmental impact of frequent retraining.

Despite this, the paper acknowledges some drawbacks, such as potential biases in measuring factuality and the imperfect methods of prompting LLMs to evaluate their knowledge requirements. However, the study significantly advances the field by proposing and testing a modular framework that could transform the way LLMs are kept current with rapidly evolving and varied knowledge domains.
