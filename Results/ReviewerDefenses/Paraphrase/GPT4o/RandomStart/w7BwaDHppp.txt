**Review of the Manuscript: GEOMETRY-AWARE PROJECTIVE MAPPING FOR UNBOUNDED NEURAL RADIANCE FIELDS**

This paper tackles a key issue in the field of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) by introducing a new method to render scenes without defined boundaries more effectively. The authors recognize that current NeRF models excel in confined settings but face challenges when objects are at varying distances and the camera orientation varies. To address this, they propose a novel p-norm-based mapping function combined with angular ray parameterization that adapts to each scene's geometry, enhancing the rendering of such unbounded scenes.

### Strengths

1. **Innovative Approach**: The authors present an adaptive mapping function using p-norm metrics that consider scene geometry—a novel solution for the non-uniform sample density in unbounded NeRFs, representing a considerable advancement.

2. **Unified Framework**: By analyzing current mapping methods through the stereographic projection perspective, the paper provides a clear framework that critiques and builds upon earlier work, enhancing understanding of existing parameterizations' pros and cons.

3. **Extensive Experiments**: The manuscript includes a comprehensive set of experiments, integrating the proposed techniques into various NeRF models, and shows superior performance across multiple datasets, both object-focused and with diverse trajectories.

4. **Clear Visualizations**: The figures and illustrations are well-designed and helpful, clarifying the transformations in different mapping techniques and effectively presenting comparative results.

5. **Comprehensive Analysis**: The authors thoroughly explore the impact of the proposed mapping and parameterization, demonstrating its effectiveness across architectures like DVGO, TensoRF, and iNGP, which highlights its broad applicability.

### Weaknesses/Areas for Improvement

1. **Complexity of Implementation**: Despite the noteworthy theoretical contributions, the complexity of implementing adaptive mapping in various NeRF frameworks might be understated. More detailed guidance on practical integration could increase accessibility.

2. **Dependence on Scene Origin**: The method’s reliance on a defined 'scene origin' could lead to performance issues if the origin choice is not optimal. While acknowledged, further exploration or alternative strategies in this area would be beneficial.

3. **Real-world Robustness**: Although the effect of noise in scene geometry estimation (like SfM camera pose errors) is mentioned, more detailed experiments on real-world scenes with high variability might bolster claims about robustness against common challenges in photography and computer vision.

4. **Computational Overhead**: The adaptive selection of a p-value using methods like RANSAC entails additional computational demand. Quantifying this overhead would help practitioners understand the trade-offs between increased accuracy and resource requirements.

5. **Limited Discussion on Alternative Parameterizations**: While focused on the p-norm, a discussion or testing of other distance metrics or geometric mappings could enhance comparative analyses and underscore the reasons behind the p-norm selection.

### Overall Impression

This manuscript significantly contributes to advancing NeRFs for unbounded scenes. The innovative geometry-aware projective mapping offers clear improvements over traditional methods struggling with scene-specific challenges. The thorough evaluation strengthens the paper's influence on future approaches to complex, unbounded scenes in neural rendering.

The paper is well-organized, effectively communicates intricate ideas, and backs its claims with robust experimental evidence. The discussion of future research opportunities indicates the authors' awareness of current limitations, suggesting promising areas for further investigation.

This work would be a valuable contribution to the conference, offering both theoretical progress and practical insights for the NeRF community.
