**Review of "Multi-objective Molecular Design through Learning Latent Pareto Set"**

The paper introduces a novel approach named Multi-Objective Molecular Design through Learning Latent Pareto Set (MLPS), addressing the complex issue of multi-objective molecular design (MMD) by integrating global and local optimization strategies. The main concept involves using an encoder-decoder model to map discrete chemical structures to a continuous latent space, while employing local Bayesian optimization within certain trust regions. The global model identifies the connection between preferences and the Pareto set by leveraging surrogate objective values derived from local models. Here is a comprehensive review:

### Strengths:

1. **Innovation and Contribution**: The paper presents a distinct approach that extends current MMD strategies by emphasizing the thorough mapping between user preferences and Pareto set solutions. This strategy enables decision-makers to explore a broader range of potential solutions, representing a major advancement.

2. **Combination of Global and Local Models**: The framework effectively investigates and utilizes the search space by integrating both global and local optimization models. This multiscale optimization approach is particularly apt for the high-dimensional challenges inherent in molecular design.

3. **Experimental Evaluation**: The paper includes extensive experimental assessments across multiple objectives and benchmarks, demonstrating that MLPS surpasses existing leading methods in numerous cases, highlighting its potential and relevance to practical problems.

4. **Detailed Analysis**: The authors present an ablation study to confirm the contributions of each component within their framework, thereby reinforcing their claims regarding the method's effectiveness.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Complexity and Scalability**: Despite proposing a robust framework, the paper does not fully address computational challenges, particularly as the number of objectives and dataset size grows. A deeper discussion on scalability with larger chemical libraries or more objectives would be beneficial.

2. **Presentation Clarity**: Certain sections, especially those that delve into the mathematical foundations of the scalarization techniques and the loss function, could be clearer. Additional diagrams or pseudocode would help make these concepts more accessible to readers unfamiliar with them.

3. **Lack of Theoretical Guarantees**: While the paper shows empirical success, it does not offer an in-depth theoretical exploration of the convergence attributes of the integrated global-local optimization strategy.

4. **Omission of Citation**: Although claiming an exhaustive review of existing methods, the paper overlooks relevant works such as Trantham et al. (2014). Including these references would offer a more comprehensive context for the advancements presented.

### Suggestions for Improvement:

- Enhance the discussion on scalability and provide insights on mitigating computational challenges.
- Clarify sections on optimization techniques and scalarization methods to improve readability.
- Consider incorporating more theoretical analysis to underpin the practical results of the method.
- Revise the literature review to include missing citations, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of related past work.

**Overall Assessment:**

The paper presents an exciting approach to a complex problem in molecular design, yielding promising results that could greatly influence areas like drug discovery and materials science. While some areas require further clarification and exploration, the contributions are significant and represent a notable progression in multi-objective optimization methods. I recommend the paper for acceptance with minor revisions.
