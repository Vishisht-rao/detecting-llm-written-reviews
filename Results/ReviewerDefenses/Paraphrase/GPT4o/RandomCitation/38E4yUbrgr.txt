**Review of "LANGUAGE MODEL SELF-IMPROVEMENT BY REINFORCEMENT LEARNING CONTEMPLATION"**

This paper introduces a new method for enhancing language models, termed Reinforcement Learning Contemplation (RLC), as a form of self-improvement. The authors propose that evaluating generated text is less complex than creating it, which allows them to update language models based on self-evaluation.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach**: The RLC method represents a novel concept in language model self-improvement by leveraging the self-assessment capabilities of language models. This innovation could reduce reliance on external labeled datasets, making it particularly appealing.

2. **Thorough Evaluation**: The paper provides extensive experimentation across multiple NLP challenges, such as BigBench-hard reasoning and CNN/Daily Mail summarization tasks, which showcases the approach's effectiveness with promising performance gains.

3. **Scalability**: The approach is applicable to models of various sizes, offering considerable flexibility in terms of deployment scenarios. This broad applicability is a significant advantage.

4. **Clear Motivations**: The justification for the model—highlighting the simplicity of evaluation tasks for self-feedback—is well-articulated and backed by data in Section 4.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Reliance on Initial Evaluation Model**: RLC uses a predefined, pre-trained model for evaluations during training. This dependency can limit adaptability, and if the evaluation model is inadequate, it can result in suboptimal training results.

2. **Lack of Theoretical Basis**: Although the empirical results are strong, providing a theoretical explanation of why evaluation tasks are inherently simpler would add depth to the paper.

3. **Limited Exploration of Evaluation Models**: The focus is primarily on the FLAN-T5 model for evaluations. Investigating other models or detailing the selection process would enhance understanding and support generalizability.

4. **Need for Clarified Explanations**: Sections explaining the integration with reinforcement learning need clearer, more detailed descriptions, particularly regarding how evaluations lead to parameter updates.

5. **Missing Relevant Literature**: The paper can further enrich its context by surveying related self-supervised methods. Additionally, a reference cited as “Heid et al. (2021)” is missing, which limits comprehension of its relevance.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Discuss the influence of the evaluation model’s size and architecture on RLC performance.
- Provide theoretical insights into why evaluation tasks are simpler than generation tasks.
- Explore dynamic evaluation models that adapt with the training model for a robust learning approach.
- Offer clearer explanations with examples of reinforcement learning integration with self-evaluation rewards.

In summary, the paper proposes an interesting approach with robust empirical support, though it would benefit from more theoretical insights and an extensive exploration of evaluation models. If RLC can be adapted with a strong and flexible evaluation mechanism, it has the potential to significantly advance NLP by reducing the dependence on labeled data.
