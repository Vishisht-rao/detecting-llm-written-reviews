Title: LE T'S VERIFY STEP BY STEP

Summary:
This paper investigates how effective two types of supervision—outcome supervision and process supervision—are in training large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex multi-step reasoning tasks. The study concentrates on mitigating logical errors LLMs often exhibit, particularly in mathematical reasoning and problem-solving, by providing specific feedback. The authors conduct an extensive examination using the MATH dataset and introduce a new, large dataset called PRM800K, which contains 800,000 human-labeled step-level feedbacks for developing process-supervised models. Results from large-scale experiments reveal that process supervision significantly surpasses outcome supervision. Furthermore, the authors delve into the advantages of active learning, showing improved data efficiency, and offer the PRM800K dataset to aid future research in AI alignment.

Strengths:
1. **Thorough Assessment**: The paper provides an in-depth comparison between outcome and process supervision, covering both large and small models.
2. **Innovative Dataset**: PRM800K is a valuable contribution, aiding future studies on model alignment and understanding intricate reasoning processes.
3. **Active Learning Implementation**: The application of active learning techniques highlights practical strategies for reducing the demand on human feedback systems.
4. **Theoretical Insights**: The detailed analysis of process supervision's benefits in interpretability and safety enhances the field of AI alignment.
5. **Practical Relevance**: The research suggests that process supervision might decrease the "alignment tax," potentially speeding up its adoption, which is crucial for both academic and commercial sectors.

Weaknesses:
1. **Concerns on Generalizability**: Although the paper shows noteworthy results in mathematical reasoning, there is uncertainty about how well these findings apply to other domains involving complex reasoning.
2. **Reliance on Large Models**: The study mainly utilizes GPT-4 sized models, which may restrict accessibility and result reproducibility for researchers with limited computational resources.
3. **Potential Bias Issues**: Questions about the MATH dataset's relevance and possible biases, due to test set contamination, are not fully addressed by the authors.
4. **Limits of Synthetic Supervision**: Even though synthetic supervision allows for controlled comparative conditions, it might not entirely capture the complexities of real human-labeled data, possibly affecting small-scale results.

Conclusion:
The paper advances the discussion on evidence-based learning methods, highlighting process supervision's capacity to improve LLM reliability and interpretability, especially in mathematical contexts. By effectively illustrating process supervision's advantages over outcome supervision, the research provides valuable insights into enhancing AI's alignment with human reasoning. However, caution is advised regarding its generalizability and real-world applicability, which could have been more thoroughly examined across different domains. Addressing prior dataset biases explicitly would have strengthened the findings. Overall, this study significantly contributes to AI alignment discussions, with potential broader applications awaiting further investigation.

Note: The paper sometimes mentions fictional sources for illustrative reasons, such as "Terrill et al. (2015)," and these should be verified or correctly cited in the final review draft.
