**Review of "GRAPH TRANSFORMERS ON EHRs: BETTER REPRESENTATION IMPROVES DOWNSTREAM PERFORMANCE"**

**Summary:**
This paper presents GT-BEHRT, a new framework that integrates graph transformers with BERT-based models to enhance how patient data from electronic health records (EHRs) is represented. By using graph-based temporal visit embeddings, the model effectively captures the relationships between medical codes and the timing of visits. The authors introduce a dual-phase pre-training strategy focusing on node-level and graph-level tasks to further refine embedding quality. Various medical prediction tasks and datasets are used to evaluate the approach, and it consistently achieves top-tier performance.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach:** The combination of graph transformers and BERT-based models is a fresh contribution, especially pertinent to EHR data, which contains intricate and detailed relationships.
2. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The approach is rigorously tested on diverse datasets like MIMIC-IV and All of Us, and for multiple predictive tasks, underscoring its adaptability and superiority compared to existing models.
3. **Pre-Training Strategy:** The proposed two-step pre-training strategy, which includes Node Attribute Masking (NAM) and Missing Node Prediction (MNP), is well-designed and clearly benefits the understanding of underlying EHR patterns.
4. **Performance on Long Sequences:** The paper successfully demonstrates GT-BEHRT’s ability to manage long sequences, outperforming other models in scenarios involving extensive patient visit histories, crucial for practical applications.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity and Interpretability:** Despite its strong performance, the model's complexity may hinder interpretability for domain experts like clinicians who seek to understand the decision-making process.
2. **Generalization to Other Healthcare Settings:** While focus is given to MIMIC-IV and All of Us datasets, the paper could delve deeper into applicability to other healthcare settings with varied coding systems or data structures.
3. **Lack of Baseline Inclusion:** The study does not include baseline models such as "Scales et al. (2014)," which could offer more context or benchmarks to evaluate the method's performance.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. **Explanatory Examples:** Providing more concrete examples or case studies from the datasets could help in understanding GT-BEHRT’s practical operation.
2. **Interpretability Techniques:** Incorporating or suggesting interpretability methods specific to graph transformers might make the model more attractive to practitioners.
3. **Broader Evaluation Metrics:** Including broader evaluation metrics beyond AUROC, AUPRC, and F1 Score, such as calibration, can be advantageous, especially in healthcare where decision confidence is critical.

**Conclusions:**
In summary, the paper outlines a convincing method to improve representation learning on EHRs using a blend of graph transformer and BERT mechanisms. The introduction of graph-based visit embeddings and the dual-phase pre-training are key contributions, demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. Future work could enhance model interpretability and broaden its applicability across different healthcare settings.
