**Review of "GFlow Net Training by Policy Gradients"**

This paper introduces a new way to train Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) using policy gradient techniques, moving away from the traditional value-based approaches typical in GFlowNet frameworks. The authors have developed a policy-dependent reward system that links GFlowNet training to reinforcement learning (RL) by focusing on optimizing expected rewards. This innovation holds the potential to address some of the challenges faced by current value-based methods, such as designing efficient backward policies and managing extensive combinatorial spaces.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovation and Contribution**: The authors offer a groundbreaking method by rethinking the GFlowNet training problem with RL concepts. This contribution is notable as it could enhance GFlowNet training efficacy by leveraging policy-based RL techniques, including Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO).

2. **Theoretical Backing**: The paper is built on strong theoretical foundations, with proofs and performance guarantees for the proposed methods. The authors extend the relationship between GFlowNet training objectives and KL divergence reduction, adding depth to the theoretical insights of their approach.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: The experiments span various datasets (like hyper-grid modeling, sequence design, and Bayesian network structure learning), validating the proposed methods’ effectiveness. The policy-based approaches outperform existing value-based methods concerning convergence speed and the final quality of learned distributions.

4. **Coupled Training Approach**: The introduction of a coupled training strategy for optimizing both forward and backward policies is an important contribution, showing potential for improved and quicker convergence as the experiments demonstrate.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Implementation Complexity and Scalability**: Despite the substantial theoretical contributions, the paper does not thoroughly address the practical complexity and scalability of the proposed methods in extremely large state spaces. It would be useful if the authors expanded on how these methods could be scaled for larger, real-world combinatorial problems.

2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: The discussion regarding sensitivity to hyperparameters such as TRPO’s trust region size, learning rates, or guided distribution parameters is limited. A deeper analysis of their impact would strengthen the proposed approach's robustness.

3. **Discussion of Related Work**: While providing extensive background on GFlowNets and RL, the paper does not sufficiently contextualize its contributions relative to recent, similar work in GFlowNets and hierarchical variational frameworks. More direct comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods, like those cited by Riggins et al. (2022), would be beneficial.

**Recommendation**: Accept with minor revisions.

The paper offers a significant theoretical and practical contribution to generative modeling with GFlowNets. The innovative use of policy gradients and RL techniques shows promise for improving training efficiency and robustness. The empirical results strongly support the proposed method, although a deeper exploration of scalability and hyperparameter effects is suggested. Addressing these areas would further enhance the paper’s impact.
