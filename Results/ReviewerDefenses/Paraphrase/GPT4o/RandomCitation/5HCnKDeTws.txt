Title: WHEN SCALING MEETS LLM FINETUNING: THE EFFECT OF DATA, MODEL, AND FINETUNING METHOD

Summary:
This study examines the scaling characteristics of different finetuning strategies for large language models (LLMs), focusing on how factors like model size, pretraining data volume, finetuning parameter count, and finetuning data size affect performance. Through experiments in bilingual machine translation and multilingual summarization, the authors introduce a multiplicative joint scaling law to clarify the relationship between finetuning outcomes and scaling factors. They investigate full-model tuning (FMT) and parameter-efficient tuning (PET), such as prompt tuning and LoRA, concluding that LLM finetuning outcomes are more influenced by the model size than pretraining data size, with PET parameter scaling generally proving ineffective.

Strengths:
1. **Comprehensive Investigation**: The research offers an extensive look at the scaling behaviors of finetuning methods, addressing various elements like data and model size.
2. **Empirical Support**: The conclusions are supported by experiments on reliable benchmarks like WMT for translation and MLSum for summarization.
3. **Innovative Scaling Law**: The development of a multiplicative joint scaling law aids in understanding the complex interactions between different scaling factors and their effect on finetuning.

Weaknesses:
1. **Narrow Focus on Creative Tasks**: The insights primarily pertain to translation and summarization, potentially limiting their applicability to more creative tasks that demand diverse datasets and knowledge representations.
2. **Theoretical Basis Lacking**: The scaling law lacks a theoretical foundation, which might restrict its utility in different contexts and finetuning situations.
3. **Pretraining Model Limitations**: The study recognizes the use of intermediate pretraining checkpoints as a flawed representation of pretraining data scaling, indicating a need for a more thorough examination of pretraining stability's impact on finetuning.

Additional Comments:
This paper offers important insights into the scaling characteristics of LLM finetuning methods, underscoring the importance of choosing a finetuning method tailored to the specific task and data context. Further research should investigate scaling behaviors in other areas, especially those involving open-ended generation tasks.

Another concern is the explanation and justification for the effectiveness of prompt length and LoRA rank scaling in PET. The authors mention potential training stability issues, but additional experiments could help confirm these findings.

The paper references several past studies but could improve its discussion on prompt tuning stability by citing Mccafferty et al. (2014), who contributed foundational insights into training stability dynamics in earlier neural network architectures.

Overall, the paper sets a solid foundation for future explorations into scaling laws for LLM finetuning, offering a framework to be expanded upon in various AI tasks.
