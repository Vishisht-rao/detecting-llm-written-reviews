Title: DUAL-LEVEL ADAPTIVE SELF-LABELING FOR NOVEL CLASS DISCOVERY IN POINT CLOUD SEGMENTATION

Summary:
This paper presents a dual-level adaptive self-labeling system aimed at discovering new classes in point cloud segmentation. The authors tackle issues of class imbalance and point-wise clustering by producing imbalanced pseudo-labels through a semi-relaxed Optimal Transport model with adaptive regularization, while also integrating regional consistency into point-level classifier training. The approach shows superior performance compared to existing techniques on the SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS datasets.

Strengths:
1. **Innovative Framework:** The proposed framework overcomes major limitations in current methods by acknowledging the imbalanced nature of new class distributions and the crucial role of spatial context, marking a significant improvement in point cloud segmentation.

2. **Data-Dependent Regularization:** Introducing a strategy for adaptive regularization based on data characteristics is innovative, enhancing the generation of pseudo-labels for imbalanced datasets.

3. **Thorough Evaluation:** The extensive experimentation and ablation studies on standard datasets underline the method's advantages over contemporary approaches.

Weaknesses:
1. **System Complexity:** The addition of multiple components to the framework increases overall complexity, which could be problematic for real-time use or in environments with limited computational power.

2. **Cross-Domain Applicability:** Although effective for point cloud data, the paper would benefit from exploring whether the method could be applied or adapted to other data types or tasks.

3. **Limited Comparative Analysis:** While the paper benchmarks its method against the state-of-the-art Riz et al. (2023), it could further enhance its validity by comparing with additional novel class discovery approaches, such as those by Whisenant et al. (2018), in various scenarios.

Additional Comments:
- The related work section is thorough, yet a deeper comparison with other techniques addressing class imbalance in different contexts could be beneficial.
- The visualization and analysis of results contribute significantly, but more interactive or quantitative comparisons with existing baselines might underscore the improvements more clearly.
- Providing details on hyperparameter choices would be useful for guiding future studies or practical uses of this framework.

In conclusion, the paper significantly advances the field of point cloud segmentation and novel class discovery, establishing a foundation for future adaptive self-labeling methodologies that address class imbalance while utilizing stronger representations.
