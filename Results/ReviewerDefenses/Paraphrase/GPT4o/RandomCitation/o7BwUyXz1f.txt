Title: CATASTROPHIC NEGATIVE TRANSFER: A NOVERLOOKED PROBLEM IN CONTINUAL REINFORCEMENT LEARNING

**Summary:**
This paper tackles an important but often ignored challenge in Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL): catastrophic negative transfer. This occurs when a policy trained across multiple tasks suffers a notable drop in performance on a new task due to the influence of certain previously learned tasks. The authors carry out extensive experiments using the Meta-World environments to highlight the commonality and effects of this issue. They introduce a solution called Reset & Distill (R&D), which involves resetting the agent's networks before learning a new task and applying offline distillation to integrate learned knowledge. This approach effectively diminishes both catastrophic negative transfer and forgetting. The method is tested through a range of experiments on several long task sequences, proving to be more successful and robust compared to existing baselines.

**Strengths:**
1. **Originality and Importance:** The paper's focus on catastrophic negative transfer in CRL is both original and timely, addressing a critical issue for the practical use of CRL in changing environments.
2. **Innovative Methodology:** The Reset & Distill (R&D) technique offers a simple yet effective way to address negative transfer, balancing efficient new task learning (plasticity) with retention of previously learned information (stability).
3. **Thorough Evaluation:** The comprehensive experimental design and analysis across various task sequences and methods provide a deep understanding of the problem and the proposed solution's efficacy.
4. **Clarity of Presentation:** The paper is well-organized, with clear sections for problem introduction, methodological advances, and experimental findings.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Lack of Theoretical Analysis:** Despite strong empirical results, the paper could benefit from a more formal theoretical examination of the conditions that lead to catastrophic negative transfer and how R&D specifically mitigates these.
2. **Acronym Confusion:** There is a minor typo ("NOVERLOOKED" in the title) that needs correction. Additionally, the frequent use of abbreviations like "CRL" and "R&D" may confuse readers unfamiliar with these terms, requiring earlier clarification.
3. **Missing Citation:** The paper references past works concerning capacity and plasticity loss but lacks a citation for "Goto et al. (2020)," relevant to transfer learning in reinforcement learning contexts.

**Recommendations:**
1. **Theoretical Discussion:** Adding a theoretical component on why catastrophic negative transfer occurs could enhance the paper’s impact and provide valuable guidance for future research in this area.
2. **Wider Range of Applications:** Applying the R&D method to other RL contexts, such as vision signal-based tasks, and demonstrating its adaptability could broaden its significance.
3. **Clarity and Proofreading:** Correcting minor errors and offering a glossary of key terms would improve accessibility for new readers.
4. **Additional Experiments:** Exploring further experiments, including examining the R&D approach’s limits, such as scaling to numerous tasks or using varied task similarity metrics, could present a more detailed picture of its applicability.

In summary, this paper significantly contributes to the continual reinforcement learning field by shedding light on the often-overlooked issue of catastrophic negative transfer and proposing an effective solution. With minor adjustments, it could become a cornerstone for further research and advancements in CRL.
