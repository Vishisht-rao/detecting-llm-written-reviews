Title: CARSO: Blending Adversarial Training and Purification Improves Adversarial Robustness

Overall Impression:
The paper introduces CARSO, an innovative defense mechanism against adversarial attacks that merges adversarial training with purification techniques for image classification. This method employs an adversarially-trained classifier along with a purification model using a conditional variational autoencoder. Experimental results indicate that this combination substantially boosts robustness against adversarial attacks, outperforming current leading methods on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.

Strengths:
1. **Innovative Approach**: CARSO creatively integrates adversarial training and purification, maximizing the advantages of each. This could inspire more research into combining different defense strategies.
2. **Thorough Evaluation**: The approach is extensively tested against various adaptive adversarial attacks, reinforcing the credibility of the results. By covering different datasets and architectures, the evaluations add weight to the findings.
3. **Leading Performance**: The study presents enhanced performance compared to current top methods, particularly with robust accuracy against strong attacks like AUTOATTACK, making CARSO a promising avenue for improving adversarial robustness.

Weaknesses:
1. **Model Complexity and Scalability**: The use of a variational autoencoder in conjunction with adversarial training introduces complexity. The paper does not fully address whether CARSO can be scaled to larger datasets or more complex models, which may impact its practical use.
2. **Trade-off with Clean Accuracy**: CARSO increases robustness at the expense of clean accuracy. While this is a common issue in adversarial defenses, investigating ways to reduce this trade-off would be advantageous.
3. **Reliance on Heuristics**: Some method choices, such as selecting layers for internal representation, rely on heuristics. A more structured approach could provide deeper insights into the method’s effectiveness.

Additional Comments:
- CARSO’s reliance on a variational autoencoder for purification might benefit from exploring other generative models like diffusion models or GANs, although these alternatives could increase complexity or training instability.
- While the paper acknowledges gradient obfuscation concerns, it does so by increasing perturbation sizes, which might not entirely replace other diagnostic techniques, like those suggested by Zeng et al. (2021). A more comprehensive analysis would be beneficial.
- The smart use of auxiliary encoders for pre-encoding samples and representations could be further developed, especially for modalities other than images.

Conclusion:
The paper makes a significant contribution to adversarial robustness by combining two established defense strategies. Despite challenges with complexity and clean accuracy trade-offs, the enhanced robustness achieved is noteworthy. Future research could focus on improving scalability and refining techniques to better balance robustness and clean accuracy.
