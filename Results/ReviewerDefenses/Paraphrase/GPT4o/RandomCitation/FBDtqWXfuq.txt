**Title:** Exploring Modality Collaboration with Modality-Agnostic Transformers in Multi-Modal Federated Learning

**Summary:**

This paper explores a new aspect of Federated Learning (FL) called Modality-Collaborated Federated Learning (MCFL), which aims to merge uni-modal clients possessing various data types. This approach addresses the shortcomings of previous multi-modal FL frameworks. The authors propose a framework named Federated Modality Collaboration (FedCola), which employs modality-agnostic transformers to tackle challenges like model variety and modality discrepancies within MCFL. The framework emphasizes sharing parameters across different modalities, model aggregation, and arranging modalities over time, reportedly outperforming existing methods through comprehensive assessments.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Concept:** Introducing MCFL offers an innovative approach to FL, filling a gap in current methodologies by targeting uni-modal clients. It is highly applicable to real-world scenarios where collecting multi-modal data is difficult.

2. **Well-Designed Framework:** The FedCola framework is robustly constructed, addressing the specifics of integrating uni-modal data. It delivers in-depth research by systematically exploring parameter-sharing, aggregation, and temporal arrangement strategies.

3. **Thorough Empirical Evaluation:** The paper exhibits rigorous empirical testing, comparing FedCola to strong baseline models and adaptations of existing methods like CreamFL, which reinforces the framework's effectiveness.

4. **Detailed Analytical Insight:** The exploration of various research questions and strategies in parameter-sharing and aggregation offers valuable insights into handling modality disparities and model diversity.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Dataset Diversity Limitations:** The study predominantly uses a mix of common datasets (CIFAR-100, AGNEWS) and specialized medical datasets (OrganAMNIST, MTSamples). While these are suitable for testing, incorporating more varied datasets could further establish FedCola's versatility and robustness.

2. **Framework Complexity:** The comprehensive framework may be overly intricate, especially with elements like modality compensation and temporal arrangement. Simplifying it or providing clearer implementation guidelines could enhance usability.

3. **Incomplete Literature Citation:** The paper cites existing multi-modal learning techniques but overlooks some recent relevant studies. For instance, it misses referencing Pfeifer et al. (2021), which discusses modality synergy in federated contexts, adding potentially valuable insights.

**Opportunities for Improvement:**

1. **Addressing System Heterogeneity:** Currently, FedCola doesn't address system heterogeneity, a prevalent challenge in federated learning. Discussing potential solutions or future research directions could enhance its contributions.

2. **Expanding Application Areas:** Broadening the framework's applications to different scenarios could demonstrate its usefulness in varying industries and uncover new insights or challenges.

3. **Real-World Implementation Discussion:** Including a section on practical implementation challenges and adapting FedCola for real-world conditions could increase the paper's practical applicability.

**Conclusion:**

In summary, the paper proposes a promising advancement in federated learning by introducing a new setting that improves modality collaboration without depending on multi-modal data. The research is well-organized, with strong experimental support for the methods proposed. By addressing the identified weaknesses, adding more datasets, and providing practical guidance, the paper could further enhance the robustness and applicability of FedCola in federated learning.
