**Review of "OUT-OF-VARIABLE GENERALIZATION FOR DISCRIMINATIVE MODELS"**

**Summary:**
This paper introduces Out-of-Variable (OOV) Generalization, focusing on scenarios where learning environments include variables that have not been observed together before. This is presented as a new facet of the broader out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization issue. The authors contend that distribution differences don't fully explain the contrasts between learning environments and suggest a method utilizing residual distributions for achieving meaningful out-of-variable generalization in machine learning models. They back their approach with theoretical findings and experiments on both synthetic and real-world data.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovation and Contribution**: The idea of OOV generalization is original and could greatly benefit machine learning, notably in sectors like healthcare, where datasets often feature different variable sets. The use of residual distributions offers a creative solution to a complex problem beyond the scope of typical transfer learning methods.

2. **Theoretical Contributions**: The paper presents extensive theoretical insights, detailing conditions where OOV generalization is possible. Theorems, particularly on the identifiability of predictive functions, provide robust theoretical support for the authors' assertions.

3. **Experimental Evidence**: Theoretical insights are bolstered by experimental results, demonstrating that their method performs well in practical scenarios, such as those encountered in medical datasets.

4. **Clear Rationale**: The introduction provides a compelling rationale for the study, pointing out the limitations of existing methods that focus only on distribution shifts, neglecting variable presence or absence.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity**: The methodology and theoretical parts are quite complex, potentially challenging readers who lack advanced knowledge in causal inference and statistical models. Simplifying or providing illustrative examples could improve understanding.

2. **Real-World Application**: Although real-world experiments are conducted, the practicality and limitations of applying the method in varied real-world settings require further investigation. More analysis on scalability and efficiency is needed.

3. **Assumptions**: The paper assumes strong conditions, like the availability of causal graphs and smoothness of generating functions, which may not apply broadly. Addressing the method's robustness against these assumptions would enhance the paper.

4. **Citation Error**: A citation for "Brehm et al. (2020)" is missing from the references, potentially an oversight. It's important to ensure all citations are correct and present.

**Detailed Comments:**

1. **Introduction and Context**: The introduction effectively frames the OOV problem, differentiating it from traditional OOD issues, using medical datasets as a pertinent example.

2. **Theory and Analysis**: The theory sections are dense but thorough, linking residual errors and unseen variables through causal assumptions, an insightful contribution.

3. **Visual Aids**: Figures like contour plots aid in visualizing the problem and the proposed method's effectiveness. Adding diagrams to illustrate causal dependencies could be beneficial.

4. **Experimental Work**: The experiments address various scenarios aligned with the theoretical claims, substantiating the practicality of the approach. Expanding to other real-world data types would be beneficial.

**Conclusion:**
The paper significantly advances the study of generalization in machine learning by introducing out-of-variable generalization. Although the theoretical depth is remarkable, enhancing clarity and exploring wider applicability could boost its overall impact. Nonetheless, it effectively opens up new paths for addressing complex machine learning challenges in environments with diverse variables.
