Title: CHAIN-OF-EXPERTS: When LLMs Meet Complex Operations Research Problems

Summary:
This paper introduces the "Chain-of-Experts" (CoE) framework, which utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to address challenging operations research (OR) problems. The CoE framework features a multi-agent system where agents are tasked with specific OR-related sub-tasks like interpreting terminology, modeling, and programming. A conductor manages these agents, and a backward reflection mechanism is included to enhance problem-solving accuracy. The authors have also developed a new dataset, ComplexOR, to benchmark their approach, showing that it outperforms existing models such as tag-BART and Reflexion.

Strengths:
1. **Original Framework**: The Chain-of-Experts framework introduces a novel way of using a cooperative multi-agent approach to solve OR problems, effectively mimicking domain expert collaboration by leveraging LLMs.

2. **Strategic Use of LLMs**: The paper demonstrates an inventive use of LLMs, capitalizing on their reasoning and collaborative skills to navigate the constraints and specific challenges of OR problems.

3. **Thorough Evaluation**: An extensive evaluation is conducted against various baselines, along with the introduction of the ComplexOR dataset, which supports the reproducibility and testing of OR models under complex conditions.

4. **Backward Reflection Mechanism**: The inclusion of a backward reflection mechanism to facilitate iterative problem-solving is particularly impressive, potentially improving the modelâ€™s precision and resilience.

Weaknesses:
1. **Reliance on LLM Capacity**: The CoE framework's performance is heavily dependent on the architecture of the LLMs used (such as GPT-3.5-turbo or Claude2), which can lead to variable results and may not fully demonstrate the efficiency of the CoE framework itself.

2. **Narrow Generalizability**: Although the ComplexOR dataset is a key contribution, the paper could further explore CoE's applicability across various industries or OR problems not covered by this dataset.

3. **Unclear Expert Selection**: The process for selecting experts within the CoE framework could be more clearly described, as the role of the conductor, while crucial, remains somewhat vague.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: While the performance comparison of CoE is detailed, the paper neglects to reference "Mowery et al. (2019)," which could offer pertinent insights or contrasts in multi-agent collaboration methods.

Conclusion:
The paper presents an innovative approach to automating complex operations research tasks using a multi-agent system powered by LLMs. The CoE setup demonstrates superior performance over baselines in evaluations, presenting a compelling case for its methodology. Despite certain limitations related to reliance on LLM capabilities and generalizability, the contributions in terms of framework innovation and dataset introduction are significant, opening new research pathways in this field.
