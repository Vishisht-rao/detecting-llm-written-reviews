Title: The Pitfalls and Promise of Conformal Inference Under Adversarial Attacks

This paper delves into the interaction between adversarial robustness and conformal prediction (CP) within deep learning frameworks, with a focus on critical applications like medical imaging and autonomous vehicles. The authors address the important challenge of integrating adversarial robustness with dependable uncertainty quantification, two areas that have largely been studied separately in the current research landscape.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Contribution:**
   The authors introduce a new adversarial training technique called Uncertainty-Reducing Adversarial Training (AT-UR), designed to enhance the efficiency of CP while preserving adversarial robustness. This is a noteworthy advancement given the existing inefficiencies of current adversarial training methods like TRADES and MART in terms of CP performance.

2. **Thorough Empirical Evaluation:**
   The extensive empirical analysis includes four diverse datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech256, and CUB200), demonstrating the method's broad applicability and validation. The AT-UR approach shows significant improvements in CP-efficiency across these datasets.

3. **Insightful Theoretical Analysis:**
   The theoretical work on Beta importance weighting provides valuable insights into its ability to refine generalization error boundaries, which is vital for the practical adoption of the proposed method in real-world scenarios.

4. **Compelling Problem Statement:**
   The paper addresses a pressing issue—ensuring dependable uncertainty quantification under adversarial threats—which is crucial for maintaining the safety and performance of AI systems in critical contexts.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Comparative Baseline:**
   Although the paper compares several baselines, expanding the comparison to include more recent methods in the field would enhance validation. Exploring methods beyond standard AT, TRADES, and MART could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach’s effectiveness.

2. **Theoretical Grounding:**
   The theoretical findings rest on assumptions concerning the distribution of TCPR, which might limit the analysis's applicability. A deeper discussion on these assumptions' validity in real-world contexts would strengthen the paper.

3. **Presentation Clarity:**
   Certain parts, particularly those detailing technical and theoretical aspects, could benefit from greater clarity and structured presentation to support understanding, especially for readers not deeply familiar with conformal prediction or adversarial training nuances.

4. **Related Work Discussion:**
   The related work section could be more comprehensive by including a wider array of recent developments in adversarial training and uncertainty quantification. An expanded discussion would provide readers with a more comprehensive understanding of the field and the paper's place within it.

Moreover, the paper mentions a reference "Billy et al. (2023)" in its discussion of recent advances, but this citation is missing from the reference list. Ensuring all citations are properly documented is crucial for the final version, allowing readers to investigate further.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper offers a significant advancement by merging adversarial training with conformal prediction to bolster AI models' safety and reliability. With enhancements in theoretical assumptions, presentation clarity, and related work discussions, the paper holds potential for significant academic and practical impact.
