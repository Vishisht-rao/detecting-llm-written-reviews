### Review of "Nonnegative Matrix Factorization through Canonical Edges"

The paper introduces a new method for Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) using Nonnegative Canonical Edges (NCEs). The goal is to enhance traditional NMF by offering deterministic solutions and a better initialization technique.

#### Strengths:
1. **Fresh Perspective:** Introducing NCEs provides a new outlook on NMF. By focusing on intersections with canonical faces of the nonnegative orthant, the authors develop a new technique that provides a closed-form solution when one factor is orthogonal.

2. **Global Solutions in ONMF:** The paper claims to resolve a longstanding issue in Orthogonal NMF (ONMF) with a closed-form method offering global guarantees, a significant achievement given past challenges in this area.

3. **Thorough Investigation:** The authors perform extensive experiments to assess the number of NCEs and the volume of their cones, showing that these cones often cover a large part of the nonnegative subspace, enhancing the understanding of NCEs' practical use.

4. **Practical Implications:** NCEs can serve as effective initializations for traditional NMF techniques, potentially improving performance in applications dealing with noisy data.

#### Weaknesses:
1. **Computational Feasibility:** The basic algorithm for identifying NCEs is not ideal for large-scale practical use, and the paper does not fully explore the computational viability of the proposed solutions, especially in challenging scenarios.

2. **Need for Practical Examples:** Despite discussing the theoretical advantages of NCEs, the paper could benefit from more real-world or practical examples to demonstrate their utility beyond synthetic datasets.

3. **Technical Complexity:** Some sections are highly technical, which may be difficult for readers not well-versed in advanced matrix factorization. Simplifying these or adding intuitive explanations could make the paper more accessible.

4. **Comparison Lacking:** While the authors compare their method with random initialization and PCA, a comparison with other recent NMF algorithms could provide clearer insights into its relative performance improvements.

#### Suggestions for Improvement:
- **Optimize Computational Approach:** Discussing ways to improve computational efficiency for large datasets could increase the method's practical impact.
- **More Diverse Experiments:** Using a wider variety of datasets and scenarios in experiments would offer a broader view of the method's applicability.
- **Discuss Limitations:** Providing more detail on potential limitations and challenges, including uncertainties related to hyperparameters, would strengthen the paper.

Overall, the paper makes a valuable theoretical advancement in NMF by introducing NCEs, offering important insights and opening new research paths. However, to gain practical traction, further work is needed to address computational concerns and prove effectiveness in diverse real-world settings.

One minor issue: the paper refers to "Northrup et al. (2019)," which is not included in the references, and this should be corrected in future revisions.
