Title: RODYN-SLAM: Robust Dynamic Dense RGB-D SLAM with Neural Radiance Fields

Summary:
The paper introduces RoDyn-SLAM, a robust SLAM solution designed for dynamic environments using neural radiance fields (NeRF). The authors tackle the issue of dynamic scenes by developing a motion mask generation method that combines optical flow with semantic segmentation. The SLAM framework features a new pose optimization strategy that handles keyframes and non-keyframes differently, along with an edge warp loss to enhance geometric constraints. Experimental results indicate that RoDyn-SLAM outperforms existing NeRF-based methods on dynamic datasets, setting a new benchmark for accuracy and robustness.

Strengths:
1. **Innovative Approach**: This work takes a novel route by employing neural radiance fields in dynamic RGB-D SLAM, addressing the limitations of previous methods focused on static scenes.
2. **Motion Mask Generation**: The integration of optical flow and semantic segmentation for generating motion masks is intricate and effectively targets the challenges dynamic environments pose to SLAM.
3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The authors rigorously evaluate the system across various datasets, clearly demonstrating its performance superiority over existing techniques.
4. **Pose Optimization Strategy**: The use of a divide-and-conquer approach for pose optimization and the introduction of edge warp loss are well-reasoned, enhancing the systemâ€™s resilience in moving environments.

Weaknesses:
1. **Complexity and Computational Overhead**: The paper would benefit from discussing the computational demands and potential for real-time application of RoDyn-SLAM, particularly regarding the integration of optical flow and semantic segmentation.
2. **Impact of Segmentation Errors**: Dependencies on semantic segmentation might result in errors due to inaccurate labeling, especially in congested scenes. Addressing this limitation would be beneficial.
3. **Generalization**: Although showing strong results on specific datasets, the paper could be strengthened by discussing its applicability across different dynamic scenes and sensor configurations.

Minor Comments:
- The related work section is comprehensive but could better highlight comparisons between this approach and newer dynamic SLAM methods beyond NeRF, offering broader context.
- While the appendix is detailed, it would enhance the main text if it included some implementation specifics to aid reproducibility.

Citation Error:
There is an incorrect citation of "Hansel et al. (2024)" in the context of related work on neural radiance fields. The authors should verify and correct this error, as the reference is not found in the literature.

Overall, RoDyn-SLAM makes a significant contribution to SLAM in dynamic environments by integrating advanced neural representations with robust pose estimation strategies. However, considerations regarding computational requirements and segmentation accuracy remain. The paper is well-composed and structured, making it accessible for those interested in NeRF and SLAM developments.
