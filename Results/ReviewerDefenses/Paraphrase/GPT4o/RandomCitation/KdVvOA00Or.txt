**Review Summary:**

The paper introduces Regularized Continuous Target Shift Adaptation (ReTaSA), a new approach aimed at tackling continuous target shift in regression tasks. This issue occurs when the distribution of the target variable changes between training and testing, while the conditional distribution of features given the target remains constant. The authors propose a nonparametric method to estimate an importance weight function by solving an ill-posed integral equation. They provide theoretical proof for their method's effectiveness and demonstrate its utility through experiments on both synthetic and real-world data.

**Key Points:**

- **Originality:** The paper explores the relatively uncharted territory of continuous target shift in regression domain adaptation, a topic often overlooked in favor of classification problems (label shift). The authors address the complexity of an infinite-dimensional target space.

- **Technical Quality:** The paper utilizes Tikhonov regularization to manage the ill-posed integral equation. The authors present a thorough theoretical analysis, including proofs of statistical consistency and convergence rates for their estimator. The use of operator notations lends technical rigor and strengthens the approach.

- **Experimental Evaluation:** Through various experiments on synthetic data and real-world datasets like SOCR and Szeged weather, the paper shows that ReTaSA outperforms existing methods such as KMM and L2IWE in both accuracy of weight estimation and predictive performance, especially with different sample sizes and shifts.

- **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is well-structured with clear writing. Mathematical formulations and theoretical arguments are detailed, while figures and tables clearly depict the experimental findings.

**Minor Points:**

- **Related Work:** The paper discusses key literature on target shift and distribution adaptation, but misses several important studies that could add context. For example, "Rey et al. (2014)" is mentioned without being included in the reference list.

- **Practical Applications:** While the authors discuss real-world relevance, such as medical predictions and anti-causal settings, exploring additional case studies or industries facing continuous target shift could be beneficial.

- **Future Work:** The authors propose future avenues, like addressing out-of-distribution cases and enhancing density ratio estimation methods. More discussion on these topics could guide further research in this area.

**Conclusion:**

The paper significantly contributes to the understanding and management of continuous target shift in regression tasks, offering a theoretically sound and empirically validated solution to a challenging problem in machine learning. With some additions in citations and a wider exploration of applications, the paper could have a substantial impact on the domain adaptation field.
