### Review of "Enhancing LoRA for Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning"

#### Summary:
This paper presents an innovative modification to the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique, specifically for use in privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) environments. The proposed method, called Federated Freeze A LoRA (FFA-LoRA), seeks to overcome challenges associated with the traditional LoRA approach in federated learning, especially in privacy-sensitive scenarios. It tackles problems such as data heterogeneity, noise amplification due to differential privacy (DP) requirements, and sensitivity to LoRA's scaling factor hyper-parameters. FFA-LoRA aims to achieve more efficient and stable federated fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). Through theoretical insights and empirical tests, the paper demonstrates enhanced computational efficiency and consistent performance across a range of tasks.

#### Strengths:

1. **Addressing LoRA's Issues in FL**:
The paper effectively pinpoints major challenges when applying LoRA in federated learning, particularly in terms of data diversity, difficulties in model averaging, noise amplification under DP conditions, and the importance of tuning hyper-parameters.

2. **Original Method**:
FFA-LoRA introduces an innovative adjustment to LoRA by freezing the initialization of non-zero matrices, which theoretically minimizes the instabilities seen when both matrices in LoRA are trained together.

3. **Thorough Evaluation**:
Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets and models, such as RoBERTa and LLaMA, demonstrating FFA-LoRA's superior performance under various privacy-preserving conditions. Its robustness is proven across different data heterogeneity levels and privacy constraints.

4. **Solid Theoretical Basis**:
The paper provides a strong theoretical foundation for FFA-LoRA, especially concerning smoothness conditions and the interplay between scaling factor and learning rate. The potential to reduce communication costs in federated settings is highlighted as a significant benefit.

5. **Broader Applicability**:
The paper also explores the application of FFA-LoRA beyond LLMs, extending into fields like computer vision, thus adding value by demonstrating its wider applicability.

#### Weaknesses:

1. **Complexity of DP Analysis**:
While the implementation of DP-SGD is covered, the differential privacy analysis is somewhat complex, and the mathematical derivations may need clearer explanations to be more accessible to a wider audience.

2. **Limited Initial Strategy Exploration**:
The exploration of various matrix initialization strategies is somewhat brief; a more in-depth analysis could be beneficial, including a detailed rationale for selecting specific initializations.

3. **Comparative Baseline Limitations**:
The comparative baseline could be broadened. Although FFA-LoRA is favorably compared to standard LoRA, it would be beneficial to include other emerging PEFT methods adapted for federated or privacy-preserving contexts to provide a more comprehensive view of the improvements. The paper references Abdallah et al. (2021), which might offer insights into recent PEFT advancements and be useful for further comparisons.

4. **Data and Privacy Assumptions**:
Certain assumptions regarding data distribution and privacy budgets may not be applicable in all practical scenarios. A discussion on the limitations and circumstances under which these assumptions might be constraining could enhance the paper's practical relevance.

#### Conclusion:
In conclusion, this paper significantly contributes to enhancing task-specific parameter efficiency in privacy-preserving federated learning. The combination of strong theoretical insights and comprehensive empirical validation makes FFA-LoRA a promising approach to deploying LLMs in environments with stringent privacy demands. Future research could explore adapting FFA-LoRA for even more constrained settings or integrating it with other PEFT strategies.
