**Review of "DIFFSOUND: DIFFERENTIABLE MODAL SOUND SIMULATION FOR INVERSE REASONING"**

This paper presents DIFFSOUND, a differentiable framework for simulating modal sound synthesis aimed at solving diverse inverse sound-related problems. The authors aim to connect differentiable simulation techniques with modal sound synthesis by creating a pipeline that can infer and optimize physical attributes such as materials, geometry, and impact locations from sound data. The framework includes a differentiable approach to shape representation, a high-order finite element analysis (FEM) module, and a differentiable audio synthesizer.

### Strengths:

1. **Addressing an Innovative Problem**:
   - The paper addresses the challenging subject of applying differentiability to modal sound synthesis, a lesser-explored field with vast potential applications in graphics, robotics, and AI. By targeting inverse reasoning, the authors present a framework crucial for real-to-sim applications.

2. **Robust Framework**:
   - The combination of high-order finite element analysis with differentiable sound synthesis is innovative and well-justified. It promises high accuracy for solving inverse problems.

3. **Solid Experimental Results**:
   - The paper provides strong experimental evidence, covering scenarios like estimating material parameters, inferring shape geometry, and determining impact positions, showcasing the framework's versatility.

4. **Effective Loss Strategy**:
   - A hybrid loss function using multi-scale spectral loss and optimal transport addresses common challenges in sound optimization, such as convergence issues and local minima.

5. **Use of Advanced Tools**:
   - Implementing the framework using PyTorch for automatic differentiation is wise, as it taps into the package's strengths in efficient and scalable computations.

### Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:

1. **Computational Complexity**:
   - High-order FEM methods, while accurate, can be computationally intensive. The paper would benefit from a deeper analysis and discussion of computational demands compared to other methods.

2. **Assumptions and Limitations**:
   - The paper notes difficulties with complex shapes and nonlinear sounds but lacks a thorough exploration of these challenges and possible solutions.

3. **Limited Examples**:
   - The study relies on synthetic data and a few real-world cases. Including a broader range of real-world examples and comparisons with current state-of-the-art methods would enhance the findings.

4. **Data Diversity**:
   - The experiments are limited to the ObjectFolder-Real dataset. Testing on more varied objects and settings could demonstrate DIFFSOUND's robustness and applicability.

5. **Clarity and Presentation**:
   - While the writing is generally good, clearer explanations in complex mathematical sections and more illustrative examples or diagrams could aid those unfamiliar with the subject.

6. **Referencing Miscues**:
   - The paper references "Fabela et al. (2021)" without including a source in the bibliography. This should be corrected or omitted if unnecessary.

### Conclusion:

The paper makes a notable contribution to sound simulation by proposing a new framework that merges differentiable simulation with modal sound synthesis. Despite areas needing improvement, especially regarding the breadth of experiments and computational analysis, the core concept is innovative and promising. This work paves the way for new research opportunities in multisensory integration, sound synthesis, and inference, offering valuable insights for researchers in computer graphics, machine learning, and audio processing.
