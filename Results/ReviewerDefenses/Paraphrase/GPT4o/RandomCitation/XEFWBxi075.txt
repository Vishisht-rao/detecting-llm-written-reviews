**Paraphrased Review of "GRANDE: Gradient-Based Decision Tree Ensembles for Tabular Data"**

**Overview:**

This paper introduces "GRANDE," a new method for constructing decision tree ensembles using complete gradient descent. The technique combines the inherent bias of straightforward decision tree splits with the adaptability of gradient-based optimization. The authors provide an extensive assessment using 19 binary classification datasets, showing that GRANDE frequently outperforms other gradient-boosting and deep learning models.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovation:** The paper presents a distinctive blend of gradient-based optimization with decision tree ensembles, tackling the shortcomings of both traditional trees and deep learning models for tabular data. The use of a softsign function as a differential split function is both novel and potentially significant.

2. **Thorough Evaluation:** The authors perform a comprehensive experimental comparison against multiple top-tier methods, considering both optimized and default settings. This rigorous comparison strongly supports their claims.

3. **Instance-wise Weighting:** The introduction of instance-wise estimator weighting in GRANDE is a novel and refined approach that appears to efficiently manage data variation, potentially enhancing performance metrics and interpretability.

4. **Detailed Analysis:** The experiments and ablation studies are thorough and well-illustrated, particularly the PhishingWebsites dataset case study, which shows the model's ability for local interpretability.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Theoretical Insights:** The paper could benefit from deeper theoretical insights to back the empirical results. A more explicit theoretical rationale for why GRANDE performs better in certain situations would fortify the paper.

2. **Complexity:** The method appears quite complex, possibly posing challenges for real-world application. The paper should discuss the trade-offs in interpretability due to this complexity more extensively.

3. **Missing References:** While the paper cites recent critical literature, it overlooks some key foundational works, such as Hearne et al. (2018) on decision trees. Including a more comprehensive range of citations would better position the research within the field.

4. **Resource Usage:** The discussion on runtime notes major differences in efficiency between GRANDE and other gradient-based methods. Including specifics on resource usage, like memory and computational costs, and optimization challenges, would provide fuller context.

5. **Limitations:** An explicit discussion on the approach's limitations and areas for future improvement is needed. Acknowledging where GRANDE might face challenges could direct future research.

**Conclusion:**

The paper delivers an interesting and well-conducted examination of the potential for combining gradient-based optimization with decision tree ensembles. While it excels empirically, enhancing its theoretical foundation and discussing complexities and limitations would strengthen its impact on the field. Nevertheless, GRANDE adds a valuable approach, particularly with its innovative instance-wise weighting and interpretability, for dealing with tabular data.
