### Review Summary

The paper tackles the crucial issue of overcoming saddle points in hierarchical optimization, particularly in the contexts of minimax and bilevel optimization. The authors introduce a new algorithm, Perturbed Recursive Gradient Descent Ascent (PRGDA), which is designed to efficiently locate second-order stationary points in nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization and nonconvex-strongly-convex bilevel optimization problems. This approach claims to improve on current methods by utilizing only first-order information while providing enhanced gradient complexity. The authors assert that theirs is the first algorithm to guarantee second-order stationary points in stochastic nonconvex minimax optimization without requiring second-order derivatives.

### Strengths

1. **Importance of Problem**: Handling saddle points in nonconvex optimization is crucial, which is relevant to various machine learning applications like adversarial training and meta-learning.

2. **Originality**: The paper's originality lies in being the first to offer a guarantee for locating second-order stationary points in stochastic nonconvex minimax optimization using first-order methods alone.

3. **Algorithmic Innovation**: The introduction of the PRGDA algorithm, which does not rely on nested loops or second-order data, is a noteworthy innovation, potentially leading to more practical and efficient computational implementations.

4. **Theoretical Backing**: The authors supply thorough proofs regarding the algorithm's convergence properties and complexity levels, placing it alongside current techniques for finding first-order stationary points.

5. **Empirical Evidence**: The experiments documented, particularly on matrix sensing tasks, showcase PRGDA’s effectiveness in bypassing saddle points and achieving global minima.

### Weaknesses

1. **Clarity and Structure**: Despite its valuable theoretical insights, the paper’s narrative could be improved in terms of clarity and organization. The heavy use of mathematical notation and dense text may pose challenges for readers less familiar with the topic.

2. **Comparative Analysis**: While the paper includes comparisons with several existing algorithms, extending this analysis to incorporate recent state-of-the-art methods could give a fuller picture of PRGDA’s performance and efficiency.

3. **Assumptions Made**: The convergence assumptions like Lipschitz continuity and strong convexity, though common, may restrict applicability in broader or more real-world contexts. Discussing these assumptions' implications in practical scenarios would be helpful.

4. **Reference Completeness**: There is a missing citation ("Morales et al. (2021)") in the bibliography, highlighting the need for complete and consistent referencing.

5. **Experiment Variety**: Only using matrix sensing as a validation task limits the empirical analysis. Additional experiments on varied problems could strengthen this section by demonstrating wider applicability across different domains.

### Recommendations

The paper introduces a promising approach to optimization challenges. To enhance its clarity, ensure complete referencing, and broaden empirical validation, the paper would benefit from revisions in those areas. These changes could significantly bolster its contribution to the field of optimization research.
