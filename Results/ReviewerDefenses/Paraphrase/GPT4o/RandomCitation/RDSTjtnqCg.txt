**Review Summary:**

The paper, titled "SCALING FOR TRAINING-TIME AND POST-HOC OUT-OF-DISTRIBUTION DETECTION ENHANCEMENT," introduces two complementary methods aimed at improving the out-of-distribution (OOD) detection capabilities of neural networks: SCALE and ISH. The primary goal is to better understand and use activation scaling to enhance OOD detection during both training and inference. The study offers an in-depth exploration of activation distributions and proposes techniques that ensure in-distribution (ID) accuracy while boosting OOD detection performance.

**Strengths:**

1. **Detailed Analysis:** The paper conducts an exhaustive analysis of activation distributions with statistical methods and assumptions (e.g., rectified Gaussian distributions). Theoretical insights are supported with empirical evidence, contributing to a clearer understanding of the mechanisms enhancing OOD detection.

2. **Innovative Approach:** SCALE, a method for post-hoc model enhancement that focuses on scaling rather than pruning, is novel. It delivers excellent OOD detection results without compromising ID accuracy, marking a significant improvement over methods like ASH and ReAct.

3. **Efficient Training-Time Strategy:** Introducing Intermediate Tensor Shaping (ISH) as a training-time method for OOD detection is innovative. It uses activation scaling by adjusting the learning rate based on activation magnitude (ID-ness), achieving notable improvements with minimal computational cost.

4. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The paper details extensive experiments across various datasets (e.g., ImageNet, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and model architectures, effectively demonstrating the superiority of SCALE and ISH compared to current leading methods.

5. **Open Code and Models:** By making the code and models publicly available, the authors enhance reproducibility and foster further research in this field.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Underlying Assumptions:** The approach assumes that activation distributions are Gaussian, which might not universally apply to all architectures or datasets. Although these assumptions are substantiated in the paper, potential limitations should be considered if they do not hold.

2. **Baseline Comparison:** The paper might benefit from a broader array of baseline methods explicitly aimed at confidence calibration (like SCALE) to ensure more comprehensive comparisons.

3. **Clarity of Explanation:** While the theoretical analysis is thorough, parts of the derivations involving activation statistics could be clearer. More intuitive explanations or visual aids might improve understanding.

4. **Absence of Real-World Applications:** Although benchmark tests are thorough, applying the methods to real-world scenarios, such as autonomous vehicles or medical diagnostics, would further validate the findings.

5. **Missing References:** While discussing comparative methods and past research, the paper overlooks citing recent relevant works like "Thrower et al. (2023)" that provide insights into related OOD detection strategies.

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper makes valuable contributions to OOD detection in neural networks through its innovative use of activation scaling. SCALE and ISH show promising results and practical benefits over existing methods. Despite some limitations regarding assumptions and the breadth of comparisons, the paper excels in methodological transparency and thorough experimentation. It is apt for presentation at conferences like ICLR 2024, as it significantly advances an essential area of machine learning.
