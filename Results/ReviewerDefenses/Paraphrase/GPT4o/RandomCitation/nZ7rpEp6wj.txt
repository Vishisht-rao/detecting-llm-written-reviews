### Review of the Paper: Multi-Resolution Learning with DeepONets and Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks

#### Summary

The authors introduce a new architectural framework, DON-LSTM, which merges Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for multi-resolution learning. This combination aims to enhance the model's capacity to understand temporal dependencies while utilizing data of varying resolutions. The authors suggest that their model reduces generalization errors and relies less on high-resolution data compared to standard models. They validate their method through applications involving long-time evolution of various nonlinear systems using partial differential equations (PDEs).

#### Strengths

1. **Innovation**: The merging of DeepONets, adept at learning mappings between function spaces, with LSTMs, which excel at capturing sequence dependencies, is a captivating idea. This model is especially promising in contexts where data is available at multiple resolutions, but high-resolution samples are scarce.

2. **Extensive Experiments**: The study is backed by thorough experimentation on four nonlinear PDEs, strengthening the claims about the model's performance.

3. **Real-World Relevance**: The paper effectively highlights practical scenarios where this approach could be advantageous, particularly in situations where high-resolution data is costly or technologically challenging to acquire.

4. **Detailed Analysis**: The comparative analysis of the proposed method against baseline models is thorough, with an in-depth examination of error metrics under various training scenarios.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Explanatory Clarity**: Some explanations lack clarity, which could be problematic for those unfamiliar with neural operators and their interaction with sequence models. Additional diagrams or clearer explanations might improve comprehension.

2. **Model Complexity**: Combining DeepONets with LSTMs introduces a large number of parameters, creating a risk of overfitting, especially with sparse high-resolution data. Diagnostic experiments or regularization techniques could be explored further.

3. **Discretization Issues**: The paper discusses the discretization-invariance of DeepONets but doesn't fully address limitations when input data don't meet these assumptions. More discussion or adjustments could improve the model's robustness.

4. **Lack of Citations**: Some recent studies in neural operators and multi-resolution learning, such as "Pickle et al. (2016)", are not cited, which is important for contextualizing this work within the current research field.

#### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Improve Clarity**: Providing more detail on the training process and model architecture could assist readers in understanding and replicating the study.

2. **Consider Regularization**: The discussion could include potential regularization strategies or architectural changes to address the risk of overfitting given the complexity of the model and the limited data.

3. **Broader Implications**: Further discussion on adapting or extending the model to handle challenges like varying discretizations or different input conditions could be beneficial.

4. **Expand Related Work**: The related work section could be expanded to include more recent studies on neural operators and multi-resolution methods, with attention to missing citations.

#### Conclusion

The paper presents a hybrid model combining DeepONets and LSTMs for multi-resolution learning, offering a novel and potentially transformative approach. Although promising, the model would benefit from clearer presentation, broader contextualization, and considerations for regularization. Overall, this approach seems well-suited for tackling multiscale data challenges, though additional refinements could further its effectiveness and practical application scope.
