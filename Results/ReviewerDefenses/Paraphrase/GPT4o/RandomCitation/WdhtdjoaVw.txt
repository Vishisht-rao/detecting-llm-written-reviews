**Review of "Functional Wasserstein Bridge Inference for Bayesian Deep Learning"**

The paper proposes an innovative method called Functional Wasserstein Bridge Inference (FWBI) to tackle significant issues in Bayesian deep learning. This novel approach emphasizes function-space variational inference and utilizes a Wasserstein distance-based bridge to address the shortcomings of Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence in function distribution analysis. The authors assert that their method effectively assigns meaningful functional priors while ensuring well-behaved posterior distributions. Comprehensive theoretical insights are backed by empirical evaluations across diverse tasks, demonstrating strong performance relative to existing parameter-space and function-space methods.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach:** The introduction of a Wasserstein bridge to break down the functional variational inference objective is both original and compelling from a theoretical perspective. This method potentially offers a more robust measure of dissimilarity than traditional KL-based approaches.

2. **Solid Theoretical Foundation:** The paper provides solid theoretical support for its assertions, establishing that the functional variational objective derived is a lower bound on model evidence. This is a notable addition as it validates FWBI as a precise objective for Bayesian inference.

3. **Thorough Evaluation:** Empirical assessments covering a wide array of tasks, from basic extrapolation problems to complex image classification, are thorough. FWBI consistently achieves improved predictive performance and uncertainty quantification, underscoring its practical relevance.

4. **Versatility and Applicability:** The method’s capacity to integrate both GP and non-GP priors expands its applicability across a broad spectrum of Bayesian deep learning models.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity and Interpretability:** Despite the robust theoretical framework, FWBI may be complex for practitioners not well-versed in Wasserstein distances and associated optimization techniques. Additional clarity on result interpretability could be advantageous.

2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** Dependence on several hyperparameters (e.g., λ1 and λ2 in the Wasserstein bridge) may present practical challenges, as optimizing these parameters can be challenging. Exploring automated or systematic methods for selecting these hyperparameters would enhance the paper.

3. **Undiscussed Computational Costs:** While the paper claims computational efficiency for FWBI, a detailed comparison of computational costs with other cutting-edge methods is lacking. An in-depth discussion on FWBI's scalability concerning model size and dataset would be beneficial.

4. **Omission of Citations:** The paper does not reference some recent developments in Wasserstein-based inference, like the approach by Gage et al. (2023), which might relate to their work. Adding such citations would provide a more complete context for the research.

**Conclusion:**

The paper represents a significant advancement in Bayesian deep learning, offering a compelling alternative to KL divergence for function-space variational inference. FWBI’s effective use of functional prior information, alongside its empirical success, establishes it as a valuable tool for practitioners. Addressing the noted areas for improvement would further elevate the paper’s quality and applicability. Overall, the paper makes a noteworthy contribution and is recommended for researchers and practitioners interested in Bayesian methods and deep learning uncertainty quantification.
