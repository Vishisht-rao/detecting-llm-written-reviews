Title: "Aligning Brain Functions Boosts the Decoding of Videos in Novel Subjects"

Summary:
The paper introduces an innovative technique to improve the decoding of video stimuli from fMRI data by aligning brain responses across different individuals. Utilizing optimal transport for this functional alignment, the authors demonstrate enhanced decoding performance, especially for subjects with limited data. They show that models training with data from several aligned subjects can match, if not exceed, the performance of single-subject models and offer better generalization to new subjects. According to the authors, this approach has the potential to leverage extensive neuroimaging datasets to enhance decoding in smaller, more limited datasets.

Strengths:
1. **Innovative Approach**: The paper presents a creative strategy for addressing the issue of variability among subjects in fMRI data decoding through functional alignment.

2. **Impressive Results**: The reported advancements in decoding capabilities, particularly in data-poor conditions, are significant (up to a 75% increase), marking a notable progress in the domain.

3. **Clear Methodology**: The detailed methods section outlines the process of brain data alignment and decoder training clearly, with well-designed figures and diagrams aiding comprehension.

4. **Insightful Analysis**: The analysis of training set size and noise in test sets offers useful insights into the practical limits and potential optimizations in brain decoding efforts.

5. **Layered Contribution**: The research not only aims at improving decoding techniques but also enhances understanding of functional alignment related to brain structure, contributing meaningfully to science.

Points for Improvement:
1. **Comparative Analysis with Other Methods**: Although various alignment techniques are mentioned, a direct comparison would clarify the advantages and drawbacks of the proposed method.

2. **Sample Size Concerns**: The study only involves three subjects, and while the method shows promise, it needs validation with larger, more diverse datasets to ensure it can be broadly applied.

3. **Video Source Variability**: The impact of different video data sources on alignment effectiveness is not discussed, which could affect the method's ability to generalize across varied datasets.

4. **Citations and References**: More contextualization with the inclusion of works such as Zamorano et al. (2018), focusing on related areas, could enhance the paper.

5. **Technical Details on FUGW Parameters**: A more in-depth exploration of the sensitivity and impact of Fused Unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein (FUGW) method parameters would be useful.

Concluding Remarks:
This research offers a promising pathway for advancing brain-computer interfaces by addressing a key challenge in brain decoding innovatively. Despite some limitations, notably in terms of sample size and generalization potential, the results are intriguing. Further research in this direction could greatly contribute to applications in cognitive neuroscience and medical diagnostic fields.
