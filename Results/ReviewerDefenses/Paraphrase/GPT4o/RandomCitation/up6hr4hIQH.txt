**Review:**

The paper "Towards Robust Fidelity for Evaluating Explainability of Graph Neural Networks" tackles a significant problem in explainable AI by focusing on how to assess the explainability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The authors propose new fidelity measures that aim to withstand distribution shifts, a frequent issue with current metrics. They introduce an information-theoretic approach to graph explanation, offering both theoretical and empirical support to demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed metrics.

The paper addresses challenges in GNN explainability, noting that existing fidelity measures like Fid+, Fid−, and Fid∆ often struggle with distribution shifts, especially when dealing with unconventional subgraph configurations. By proposing a probabilistic method to evaluate subgraph explanations in GNNs, the authors seek to fill this gap. They assert that their fidelity measures offer greater reliability by minimizing bias caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) issues.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Contribution:** The introduction of fidelity measures that account for distribution shifts marks an important advancement from traditional metrics, filling a critical gap in evaluating GNN explainability.

2. **Thorough Evaluation:** The authors provide a comprehensive empirical evaluation with both synthetic and real datasets, showing that their measures align more closely with gold-standard metrics than current measures do.

3. **Theoretical Grounding:** The paper outlines the theoretical basis of the proposed measures and provides proofs, which strengthens the validity of their contributions.

4. **Practical Relevance:** Focusing on areas like healthcare and fraud detection, where explainability is vital, highlights the practical significance of this research.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity:** Although the theoretical framework is detailed, its complexity might impede its widespread application without significant effort from practitioners to understand and implement the proposed methods.

2. **Empirical Comparisons:** While experiments showcase the method's effectiveness, further comparisons with a broader range of recent techniques could bolster the approach's robustness.

3. **Clarity:** Certain sections would benefit from clearer explanations, particularly regarding how the proposed metrics address the OOD problem. This clarity would be helpful for readers unfamiliar with the information-theoretic approach employed.

**Minor Issue:**

- The review points out that the paper cites Anaya et al. (2020), which is not listed in the bibliography. Ensuring all citations are included and referenced is crucial for maintaining academic integrity and completeness.

In summary, the paper provides a valuable contribution to GNN explainability with its robust fidelity measures. The theoretical insights are compelling, and the empirical work is persuasive. With enhancements in clarity and complexity management, the paper could have an even greater impact.
