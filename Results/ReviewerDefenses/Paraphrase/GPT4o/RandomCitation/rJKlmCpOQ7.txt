Title: Removing Multiple Shortcuts through the Lens of Multi-Task Learning

Summary:
This paper introduces an innovative technique for training models on biased datasets by applying concepts from multi-task learning (MTL). The approach segments the training data into different subsets based on their influence on model bias. It then defines each subset as a separate task within the MTL framework, optimizing them through a weighted combination of task-specific losses. A weight adjustment algorithm, grounded in multi-objective optimization (MOO) theory, is used to achieve Pareto-stationary results. To validate their approach, the authors also present a new benchmark dataset, MultiCelebA, consisting of real images with multiple biases. Their method reportedly achieves state-of-the-art performance across various datasets.

Strengths:
1. Novel Approach: The paper introduces an innovative perspective by considering debiasing as a multi-task learning challenge, offering a fresh viewpoint in this domain.
2. Theoretical Foundation: Utilizing MOO and Pareto-stationarity provides a strong theoretical base for their weight adjustment and optimization techniques.
3. New Benchmark: The introduction of the MultiCelebA dataset serves as a valuable tool for assessing multi-bias debiasing approaches with real-image data.
4. Comprehensive Experiments: The paper provides extensive experimental evaluations on multiple datasets, supporting the claimed improvements in performance.

Weaknesses:
1. Complexity: The method includes several complex elements, like dynamic weight adjustment via MOO, which could complicate practical implementation and require careful hyperparameter tuning.
2. Assumption of Bias Labels: While reasonable, the requirement for bias attribute annotations in the training data limits applicability in cases where such annotations are unavailable.
3. Scalability: Although effective for multi-bias situations, the approach's scalability to larger, more diverse datasets with numerous bias types remains untested and warrants exploration.

Additional Comments:
1. The authors might consider examining their method's performance with semi-supervised or unsupervised bias detection to improve applicability in real-world settings where bias labels are scarce or costly.
2. More insights into the computational efficiency and runtime of the proposed algorithm would be advantageous.
3. Although the explanation of the weight adjustment algorithm's theoretical basis is thorough, including additional experimental evidence on its impact on optimization and convergence would strengthen the paper.

Additional Note:
The paper references Clay et al. (2020) to emphasize the importance of addressing multiple biases in training datasets, though this citation is missing from the references. Consistency and complete citation listing should be ensured.

Overall, the paper significantly contributes to the field of debiased model training and suggests new research directions for enhancing model robustness against multiple biases. Addressing the noted weaknesses and providing additional clarifications would further enhance its impact and applicability.
