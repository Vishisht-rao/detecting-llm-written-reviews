### Review of "What Matters to You? Towards Visual Representation Alignment for Robot Learning"

The paper presents an innovative approach called Representation-Aligned Preference-based Learning (RAPL) to tackle the issue of visual representation alignment in robot learning. The goal is to improve how robots learn behaviors that match human preferences using visual data. This research is particularly relevant given the increasing focus on reliable and autonomous robotics.

#### Strengths:

1. **Innovative Concept**: RAPL introduces a unique method that combines human feedback through preference triplets with optimal transport theory to align visual representations. This novel approach offers an action-free and practical way to incorporate human preferences into robot learning effectively.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The paper includes an extensive array of experiments in various robotic settings, such as X-MAGICAL and robotic manipulation, showcasing RAPL's exceptional sample efficiency and zero-shot generalization. These experiments robustly validate the advantages of the proposed method.

3. **Practical Problem Solving**: RAPL concentrates on aligning representations rather than training on rewards, which helps avoid common issues like sample inefficiency and causal confusion in preference-based learning. It also addresses cross-embodiment generalization, critical for real-world application.

4. **Technical Rigor**: The paper is technically robust, utilizing advanced ideas like optimal transport and preference-based learning with solid theoretical underpinnings. Detailed explanations of optimal transport solutions and the method's scalability enhance its credibility.

5. **In-Depth Analysis**: The investigation of attention maps and analysis of sample complexity offer valuable insights into the method's strength and potential broader applications.

#### Weaknesses:

1. **Lack of Real-world Testing**: Although the simulation results are promising, the method's real-world application remains unverified. Validation with actual hardware and human feedback is essential for practical use in varied environments.

2. **Limited Comparison with Top Methods**: The paper primarily compares with proxy-task baselines and direct reward learning methods. A more extensive comparison with other leading methods in visual representation learning for robotics (e.g., Dillon et al. (2016)) would be beneficial.

3. **Scalability Issues**: The optimal transport-based reward functions might face scalability challenges with more complex, high-dimensional input spaces. Discussion or experiments on computational feasibility and reward quality could strengthen the paper's impact.

4. **Sparse User Interaction**: While the paper emphasizes the efficiency of preference feedback, it does not explore the practical amount of feedback necessary for real-world tasks. Investigating multi-modal feedback or active learning strategies in future work is suggested.

#### Minor Comments:

- The manuscript's structure and clarity could be improved by addressing typographical issues (e.g., missing spaces, incorrect line breaks).

- Adding more visualizations or qualitative results, particularly for attention maps and behavioral differences, could enhance understanding.

In summary, the paper offers a novel approach to aligning visual representations in robot learning, supported by strong empirical findings. Although there are areas for improvement, such as real-world validation and broader method comparisons, the research presents a promising step forward in developing human-centered robotic systems. Future work should address scalability and real-world challenges, possibly incorporating multi-modal feedback methods.
