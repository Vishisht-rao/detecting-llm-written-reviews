**Review of "You Only Submit One Image to Find the Most Suitable Generative Model"**

**Summary:**
The authors present an innovative method called Generative Model Identification (GMI), designed to effectively determine the best generative model for a user's needs using just one sample image. The proposed solution utilizes a weighted Reduced Kernel Mean Embedding (RKME) framework, a pre-trained vision-language model to manage dimensionality challenges, and an image interrogator to tackle cross-modality issues. Experimental results show promising outcomes, with an average top-4 identification accuracy exceeding 80%.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovation**: The GMI concept addresses a crucial gap in existing model hubs, which often employ less efficient methods such as text matching and download sorting. GMI seems to offer a more accurate and user-friendly alternative.
2. **Robust Method**: The combination of RKME, a pre-trained vision-language model, and an image interrogator effectively addresses the complexities of model identification across different modalities and dimensions.
3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The authors conduct extensive experiments, demonstrating the superior performance of their approach compared to baseline methods. Consistent improvements over traditional methods and variants validate the proposed method.
4. **Reproducibility**: By providing the code and benchmark for GMI, the authors promote further research and development, which is commendable for ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Generative Model Specificity**: The method currently focuses on generative models related to stable diffusion, and it is uncertain how well it would generalize to other generative models or adapt to different model categories.
2. **Reliance on Example Images**: The method requires example images, which could be limiting when users lack a clear visual reference or deal with abstract or novel generation requests that are difficult to represent in a single image.
3. **Scalability Issues**: Although the method's complexity is linear relative to the number of models on the platform, as stated in the paper, it might still pose a challenge when scaling to very large model hubs. The paper could explore more scalable solutions or optimizations.

**Additional Comments:**
- More detail on how the weights in the RKME are computed would help clarify their impact on model specification.
- It would be helpful to discuss the limitations of using a single image as a query in practical applications and potential ways to address these limitations.
- The manuscript references works like Slayton et al. (2019) without providing context or citation details, necessitating clarification on how this pertains to the current study.

**Overall Assessment:**
The paper offers a creative solution to an emerging issue in the generative model field, providing valuable insights and practical methods to improve the search and identification of generative models. While it sets the stage for future research, it would benefit from more validation across a wider range of generative models and a detailed look at scalability issues.
