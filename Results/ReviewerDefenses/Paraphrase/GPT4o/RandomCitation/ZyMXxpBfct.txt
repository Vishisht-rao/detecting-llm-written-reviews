Title: Forward Explanation: Why Catastrophic Forgetting Occurs

Reviewer Comments:

This paper addresses the ongoing issue of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks by proposing a new framework called Forward Explanation. The authors aim to clarify the training process of neural networks and highlight the mechanics that lead to catastrophic forgetting. They introduce concepts such as Interleaved Representation, Task Representation Convergence Phenomena, Memory Trace, and Forward-Interleaved Memory Encoding to shed light on neural network training dynamics.

Strengths:
1. **Innovative Concepts**: The paper offers fresh ideas with Forward Explanation and related concepts like Interleaved Representation and Forward-Interleaved Memory Encoding, which enhance the understanding of how neural networks learn and could inspire new research directions.

2. **Holistic Approach**: The paper ambitiously links various concepts to provide a comprehensive understanding of catastrophic forgetting.

3. **Experimental Analysis**: Extensive experiments are conducted with well-known models (such as ResNet and ViT) and datasets (MNIST, CIFAR) to support the theoretical ideas.

Weaknesses:
1. **Theoretical Insufficiency**: Although new ideas are proposed, the lack of mathematical rigor in supporting these concepts is concerning, and the authors acknowledge this gap.

2. **Clarity and Structure**: The writing could be clearer and more logically structured. The text is dense, and complex ideas are not fully explained, making it hard for readers to understand the work's implications.

3. **Evidence from Experiments**: The experiments mainly illustrate rather than definitively prove the claims. More rigorous validation with varied conditions is necessary.

4. **Citation Issues**: A reference inconsistency is noted, with "Capps et al. (2014)" mentioned in the text but missing from the references, which affects the credibility and thoroughness of the research.

5. **Practical Application and Generalization**: The real-world applicability of Forward Explanation remains uncertain. The paper needs more discussion on how the theory could translate into practical solutions for continual learning.

Overall, the paper proposes an ambitious and potentially influential framework for understanding neural network training and catastrophic forgetting. Nonetheless, it requires stronger theoretical development and empirical evidence. Furthermore, improving the clarity of presentation and resolving citation issues would enhance its credibility and accessibility to the research community.
