### Review of "Proving Test Set Contamination in Black Box Language Models"

#### Summary

The paper titled "Proving Test Set Contamination in Black Box Language Models" introduces a new technique to detect test set contamination in large language models (LLMs) through statistical hypothesis testing. This method doesn't require access to the original training data or model weights, instead relying on the exchangeability property of datasets. The authors validate their approach on several LLMs and specially curated datasets, providing empirical support for its effectiveness.

#### Strengths

1. **Innovative Method**: The approach is groundbreaking as it tackles the complex issue of detecting contamination without needing access to private datasets or model details, potentially enhancing transparency and accountability in AI.

2. **Solid Statistical Basis**: The method is supported by a robust statistical hypothesis test based on exchangeability, offering theoretical reliability and control over false-positive rates, distinguishing it from heuristic methods.

3. **Thorough Empirical Testing**: The paper includes comprehensive empirical tests using synthetic contamination and evaluations on various public models. The findings show the method’s ability to detect test set contamination even with low duplication counts.

4. **Benchmark Release**: By making pre-trained models and a contamination detection benchmark available, the authors provide a valuable resource for the community, facilitating reproducibility and future research.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Exchangeability Assumptions**: The approach relies on test datasets being exchangeable, which may not always apply to real-world data. Although the authors discuss using random shuffles to force exchangeability, this may not capture complex real-world data dependencies.

2. **Detection Limitations**: The method is less effective at identifying contamination when duplication is minimal, highlighting the need for improvements to address subtle contamination issues.

3. **High Computational Cost**: The technique requires numerous log probability calculations, particularly with increased permutations, which may be computationally demanding for larger models and datasets.

4. **Lack of MLPs Discussion**: The paper doesn’t discuss “multilayer perceptrons” (MLPs), though including them could enhance the discussion by examining their role in understanding model behavior or as baseline models for contamination detection.

#### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Expand Dataset Considerations**: Future research should consider ways to mitigate the exchangeability assumption or address challenges from non-exchangeable datasets more effectively.

2. **Improve Detection Sensitivity**: Enhancing the method’s ability to detect contamination at a single duplication rate would significantly increase its practical value.

3. **Focus on Efficiency**: Prioritizing optimizations to reduce the computational demands of the method could improve its usability in regular practice.

4. **Discuss MLPs**: Including a discussion on how simpler neural network architectures, like MLPs, might help in understanding model memorization or serve as lightweight alternatives for similar evaluations could be useful.

#### Conclusion

The paper makes a notable contribution to AI ethics and transparency by proposing a statistically grounded method for detecting test set contamination in black-box LLMs. While there are some limitations, it offers a promising direction for future research and application in AI auditing, emphasizing the need for validation and robustness in model evaluations.
