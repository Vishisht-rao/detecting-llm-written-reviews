**Review Summary:**

The paper introduces a new method to enhance keypoint extraction and description for computer vision tasks, focusing on achieving rotation-equivariance and incorporating positional encoding. The main contribution involves a framework that merges locally rotation-equivariant descriptors with globally encoded positional information and includes a directional uncertainty weighted descriptor loss. The authors report better performance on datasets with substantial rotations, like rotated-HPatches, rotated-MegaDepth, and rotated-YFCC100M.

**Strengths:**

1. **Motivation and Relevance:** The paper tackles a significant problem in computer visionâ€”traditional neural networks' lack of rotational invariance, which impacts keypoint detection and description under large rotational changes. This is an important issue given its wide applications in dynamic settings such as drones and rapidly moving robots.

2. **Technical Novelty:** Introducing the integration of rotation-equivariant networks with positional encoding marks a novel approach. Their method seeks to capitalize on the advantages of both local feature extraction and global positional encoding.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The proposed method is thoroughly assessed on several datasets (HPatches, MegaDepth, YFCC100M) featuring different rotation scenarios (original, 90-degree, and random rotations), providing a strong evaluation of its performance.

4. **Quantitative Results:** The paper presents extensive numerical results and comparisons with other methods, demonstrating superior performance in metrics like MMA and AUC.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Clarity and Readability:** The paper is quite dense and can be difficult to follow, particularly in sections like the methodology and mathematical formulations. It would benefit from clearer explanations and additional context for complex equations.

2. **Lack of Baseline Comparison:** While the results are compared to various methods, a closer comparison with more cutting-edge neural network methods, especially those designed for rotational invariance or equivariance, would be beneficial.

3. **Discussion of Limitations:** An explicit discussion of the limitations would improve the paper, particularly concerning when the combination of local rotation-equivariant features and global positional information might fall short of achieving perfect rotational equivariance.

4. **Absence of "Gradient Sparsity":** There is no mention of "gradient sparsity," which was expected. This indicates either a discrepancy in expectations or a missing discussion on how "gradient sparsity" could impact training or model efficiency.

5. **Runtime Analysis:** Although a runtime comparison is included, there is insufficient discussion on the increased computational complexity due to positional information integration. Additional insights into how the method balances enhanced performance with computational demands could enhance its practical viability.

6. **Visual Illustrations:** More attention could be given to visual clarity through additional intuitive diagrams and clearer figures to help explain the complex concepts discussed.

**Conclusion:**

The paper introduces an intriguing and potentially influential approach to improving keypoint detection and description under rotational transformations. Despite its promising quantitative results, the paper could be enhanced in terms of clarity and in-depth comparative analysis. A more comprehensive discussion on the algorithm's scalability and efficiency, particularly in real-time applications, would also be advantageous.
