### Title: INPUT-GRADIENT SPACE PARTICLE INFERENCE FOR NEURAL NETWORK ENSEMBLES

### Summary
This paper presents the First-order Repulsive Deep Ensemble (FoRDE), a new method for ensemble learning aimed at increasing neural network diversity through the use of repulsion in the first-order input gradient space. The strategy is based on the Particle-based Variational Inference (ParVI) framework, which faces challenges with inefficiencies in weight space and the complexity of repulsion in function space. By utilizing input gradients, which describe a function with a lower dimensionality than weight parameters, FoRDE ensures diversity among ensemble networks. The idea is that varying input gradients leads to different features being learned by each network, thereby boosting robustness. The paper includes experimental results in image classification and transfer learning, indicating notable improvements in both performance and prediction calibration during covariate shifts.

### Strengths
1. **Innovative Diversity Mechanism:** The move from repulsion in weight space or function space to input-gradient-space is a novel and well-grounded concept, given the relationship between input gradients and a neural network's functional features.
2. **Rigorous Experimental Evaluation:** The paper includes extensive experiments that clearly demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness compared to existing approaches like Deep Ensembles, Weight-RDE, and Function-RDE, especially under covariate shifts.
3. **Thorough Analysis:** The study comprehensively explores various metrics, such as performance on clean versus corrupted data, functional diversity, and hyperparameter ablations, providing a detailed assessment of FoRDE.
4. **Relevance to Real-world Applications:** By emphasizing robustness amidst covariate shifts, this method is particularly applicable to dynamic environments where data distributions might change after deployment.

### Weaknesses
1. **High Computational Demand:** FoRDE requires about three times more computation time than standard Deep Ensembles, potentially limiting its feasibility in settings with constrained resources.
2. **Kernel Selection Complexity:** Selecting suitable length scales for the input-gradient kernel demands additional hyperparameter tuning, which may not be practical without substantial expertise or computational resources.
3. **Lack of Discussion on Limitations:** While the paper thoroughly highlights the positive outcomes, it lacks a balanced discussion on potential downsides or scenarios where the method might fail.
4. **Omission of "Information Bottleneck Principle":** The paper does not discuss or utilize theories like the "information bottleneck principle," which might enhance the understanding of how input gradient diversity affects learning and robustness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. **Reduce Computational Load:** Consider strategies to decrease computational demands, such as using efficient kernel approximation techniques or selecting a subset of gradients to balance accuracy and efficiency.
2. **Simplify Hyperparameter Tuning:** Explore automated tuning techniques to ease the process of selecting kernel length scales and other key hyperparameters.
3. **Expand Theoretical Framework:** Introduce discussions on the "information bottleneck principle" or similar theories to deepen the conceptual insight into the benefits of input gradient diversity.
4. **Test Across Diverse Applications:** Assess the method on a wider range of tasks, like natural language processing or reinforcement learning, to evaluate its generalizability and potential need for task-specific adjustments.

### Conclusion
The paper significantly contributes to neural network ensemble methods through its innovative approach of input-gradient-space repulsion. Its effectiveness in enhancing model robustness against covariate shifts holds promise for practical applications. However, real-world adoption necessitates addressing computational efficiency and hyperparameter tuning challenges. Future work could expand on this by incorporating additional theoretical perspectives and exploring broader applications.
