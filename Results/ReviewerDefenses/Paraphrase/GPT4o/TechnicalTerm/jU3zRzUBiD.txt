**Title:** Compensating for Nonlinear Reduction with Linear Computations in Private Inference

**Summary:**

The paper introduces "Seesaw," a new neural architecture search (NAS) method focused on privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML). Seesaw aims to improve PPML's performance by reducing the expensive computational load of nonlinear operations, which are usually costly when secured with cryptography. By boosting linear computations and reusing the outputs of nonlinear operations already performed, Seesaw seeks to maintain accuracy despite cutting down on nonlinear elements. The approach defines a new design space featuring sampling and aggregation blocks that emphasize linear operations while cleverly reusing nonlinear outputs, thereby advancing the Pareto frontier concerning accuracy and computational expense.

**Strengths:**

1. **Relevance and Timeliness:** The subject matter is crucial given the increasing importance of data privacy in machine learning. The paper tackles an important issue in PPML by optimizing the balance between accuracy and computation costs.

2. **Innovative Approach:** Seesaw's enhancement of linear operations and efficient reuse of nonlinear results presents a novel, promising strategy for PPML enhancement.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The research offers extensive evaluations with datasets like CIFAR100 and ImageNet, highlighting Seesaw's advantages over current methods.

4. **Detailed Methodology:** The new elements, such as sampling and aggregation blocks and pruning methods, are thoroughly described, facilitating comprehension of their role in performance gains.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity of Implementation:** The method involves major architectural changes and might demand significant computation power and expertise, which the paper does not thoroughly address.

2. **Generality of Results:** Although the results are impressive, they focus mainly on image classification tasks. Expanding to other domains or discussing adaptability to various tasks could improve the work's relevance.

3. **Comparative Limitations:** A deeper analysis of why Seesaw outperforms SENet and SNL, particularly in terms of "spatio-temporal grounding," is lacking and would strengthen the paper.

4. **Scalability Concerns:** While effective in reducing ReLU operations, the paper fails to address how the method scales with much larger models or datasets beyond the ones used.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Broader Evaluation:** Conduct experiments across additional domains and tasks to confirm the generalizability of Seesaw.

2. **Implementation Insights:** Offer more practical guidance or resources for implementing Seesaw in real-world settings, such as a reference implementation or open-source availability.

3. **Clarify "Spatio-Temporal Grounding":** If applicable, expanding on how Seesaw uses or benefits from spatio-temporal grounding would improve understanding of its application to real-time or sequential data.

4. **Scalability Tests:** Include evaluations on larger models/datasets to show Seesaw's robustness and scalability, or discuss approaches to manage larger cases.

Overall, the paper significantly contributes to PPML by tackling a major bottleneck in existing systems with a creative and effective solution. However, clarifying some aspects and broadening evaluations could enhance its impact and practical usefulness.
