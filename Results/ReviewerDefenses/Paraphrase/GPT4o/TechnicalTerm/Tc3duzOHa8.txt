**Review of "RODEO: Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection via Exposing Adaptive Outliers"**

The paper introduces a new technique for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection called RODEO. This method enhances robustness against adversarial attacks by using an adaptive outlier exposure (OE) strategy. The authors propose that adaptive OE should involve outliers that are diverse and conceptually distinct from inliers while staying close to the in-distribution. The approach integrates text and image data to guide the generation of outliers, producing a set of diverse, near-distribution auxiliary samples.

**Strengths:**

1. **Originality and Clarity:**
- The paper addresses a key gap in existing OOD detection models’ performance against adversarial attacks. It introduces a creative approach incorporating both text and image data, providing a cohesive solution for different OOD detection scenarios.

2. **Methodological Innovations:**
- The method utilizes a pre-trained generative diffusion model guided by textual information from normal class labels to create near-distribution OOD samples. This innovative use of multi-modal sampling supports robust adversarial training.

3. **Experimental Validation:**
- Extensive experiments are conducted on several benchmark datasets like CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and other high-resolution datasets. These experiments demonstrate the method’s superiority over existing techniques, with AUROC improvements of up to 50% in adversarial contexts.

4. **Ablation Studies:**
- The paper includes comprehensive ablation studies that reinforce the importance of both diversity and closeness of generated OOD samples. These studies are in-depth and clarify how different aspects of the RODEO pipeline contribute to its success.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity and Ease of Replication:**
- The innovative combination of diffusion models and text-based guidance adds complexity to the implementation. Providing more detailed implementation steps or making the code available would enhance accessibility and replicability for other researchers.

2. **Parameter Sensitivity:**
- The paper discusses setting thresholds for filtering generated data, like τLabel and τImage, but does not thoroughly explore performance sensitivity to these parameters. Addressing this in supplementary material would be beneficial.

3. **Evaluation Metrics:**
- While AUROC is a common metric, incorporating metrics like the F1-score or precision-recall curves could provide more insights, especially in cases of class imbalance in test conditions.

**Conclusion:**

The paper tackles a significant challenge in OOD detection by presenting a robust, adaptive approach that uses "multi-modal sampling" techniques. The method is well-supported by theoretical rationale, and the experiments highlight its potential to significantly boost robustness against adversarial attacks in various scenarios. With more work on reproducibility and parameter sensitivity, this approach could positively impact the field. The paper offers a meaningful contribution and should interest researchers focused on machine learning safety, anomaly detection, and adversarial robustness.
