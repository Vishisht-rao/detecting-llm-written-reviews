**Title**: Estimating Uncertainty from Feed-forward Network Based Sensing Using Quasi-Linear Approximation

**Summary**: This paper tackles the challenge of estimating real-time confidence in neural networks used for sensing in critical environments. The authors introduce an innovative method that adapts quasilinear approximation from control engineering to handle environmental uncertainty within neural networks. This technique enables the integration of neural network-based sensing with Bayesian filtering, allowing for real-time uncertainty detection in complex networks without the heavy computational demands of sampling-based methods.

**Strengths**:

1. **Innovative Methodology**: The paper's novel use of quasilinear approximation to estimate uncertainty in neural networks is a significant advancement. The approach is well-designed and theoretically addresses some challenges associated with Jacobian linearization and nonlinear sampling techniques.

2. **Significance**: With the growing application of neural networks in safety-critical fields, accurately estimating real-time uncertainty is essential. The paper shows an understanding of the broader significance of their proposed solution.

3. **Thorough Testing**: The authors have conducted extensive experiments, both in a controlled setting for approximation accuracy and within a simulated target-tracking scenario, showcasing potential improvements in prediction and computational efficiency.

4. **Integration with Kalman Filtering**: By combining the proposed approximation with Kalman filtering, the authors offer a practical solution suitable for continuous monitoring and decision-making applications.

**Weaknesses**:

1. **Complexity and Assumptions**: Although the proposed method is innovative, it depends on assumptions like Gaussian noise and specific activation functions (e.g., tanh, softplus, ReLU). Discussing situations where these assumptions may not hold and their impact on performance would be beneficial.

2. **Scope of Results**: While the paper shows improvement over existing methods, the practical impact in large-scale, real-world scenarios has yet to be confirmed. The simulated environment serves as a proof-of-concept but may not represent the full complexity of real-life applications.

3. **Limited Comparative Analysis**: The focus of the comparison is mainly on Jacobian and proposed SL methods. Including a broader range of state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation frameworks would provide a clearer understanding of the performance benefits.

4. **Presentation Clarity**: The dense mathematical formulations could benefit from additional explanatory text, making the content more accessible to readers less familiar with control theory.

5. **Scalability Issues**: While the method outperforms sampling-based techniques in computational efficiency, the paper insufficiently addresses scalability as network architectures grow more complex.

**Conclusion**: The paper offers a promising approach for real-time uncertainty estimation in neural network-based sensing, with potential applications in safety-critical areas. Additional empirical validation and clearer presentation could enhance the work's contributions. If the method proves effective in practical scenarios, it could greatly influence the handling of uncertainty in systems heavily reliant on neural network data processing.
