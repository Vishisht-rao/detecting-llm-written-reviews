**Review of the Paper: "NEURREV: TRAIN BETTER SPARSE NEURAL NETWORK PRACTICALLY VIA NEURON REVITALIZATION"**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces NeurRev, a framework designed to enhance Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) by tackling the problem of inactive neurons through a process known as Neuron Revitalization. The main contribution lies in refining the pruning process within DST, often ignored, to minimize dormant neurons and boost neuron learning efficiency. The framework shows improved accuracy while decreasing system overhead and training time, making it ideal for resource-limited edge devices. The approach is tested on various datasets and network models to demonstrate its validity.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach:** Neuron Revitalization brings a new angle to the DST field by addressing dormant neurons. The focus on pruning, rather than just conventional weight-growth strategies, is a significant shift.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper conducts thorough evaluations on diverse datasets (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet) and network models (ResNet-32/34/50, VGG-19), lending strong support to the framework's effectiveness and adaptability.

3. **System Level Suitability:** NeurRev's emphasis on reducing system overhead and speeding up training is particularly relevant for real-world deployment, especially on edge devices, as demonstrated through tests on a Samsung Galaxy S21 mobile platform.

4. **Quantitative Demonstration of Improvements:** The empirical results highlight advances in accuracy and computational efficiency, bolstering the claims. Ablation studies elucidate the effects of different hyperparameters.

5. **Software-Hardware Co-design Perspective:** The discussion about the role of ReLU and the integration of software and hardware provides a comprehensive approach, addressing both theoretical and practical deployment issues.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Clarity in Explanation:** Some parts, particularly those detailing the mechanisms for identifying and revitalizing dormant neurons, would benefit from clearer explanations or visual aids. More elaboration on design decisions would also be helpful.

2. **Comparison with More Baselines:** Although the paper compares with several existing methods, a broader comparison with the latest static sparse training techniques would better highlight NeurRev’s advantages and applicability.

3. **Lack of Theoretical Analysis:** The paper primarily focuses on empirical results, which are crucial, but a theoretical exploration of why NeurRev outperforms current "primal algorithm" methods in dealing with dormant neurons could provide meaningful insights and enhance the narrative.

4. **Potential Generalization:** While the results are promising, the paper mainly considers specific network types (e.g., ReLU-based CNNs). Discussing the framework’s applicability to other network types or tasks would help address questions about its generalizability.

**Conclusion:**
NeurRev is a promising framework that explores a novel area in sparse neural network training, focusing on dormant neurons and offering practical advantages for edge computing devices. Improving clarity, expanding baseline comparisons, and incorporating theoretical insights could further strengthen its impact and clarity. Nonetheless, NeurRev provides practical enhancements over existing DST methods, marking it as a significant contribution to the field.
