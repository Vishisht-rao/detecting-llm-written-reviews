**Paraphrased Review of "Protein Language Models Enable Accurate Cryptic Ligand Binding Pocket Prediction"**

1. **Summary and Contributions**
The paper introduces "Efficient Sequence-based cryptic Pocket prediction" (ESP), an innovative method that uses Protein Language Models (PLMs) to more accurately predict cryptic ligand binding pockets while being computationally more efficient. The authors report significant advancements over the latest machine learning-based methods for cryptic pocket prediction, particularly PocketMiner, with improved metrics like ROCAUC (0.93 compared to 0.87).

2. **Technical Soundness**
The methodology is technically robust and aligns with the trend of applying transformer-based architectures to biological problems, similar to their success in natural language processing. By using PLMs, the authors effectively reduce the need for extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, significantly cutting down on computational demands and addressing scalability challenges faced by traditional methods.

3. **Experimental Methodology**
- The study employs several PLMs, including Ankh-Large and ESM-2, to identify cryptic pockets.
- The experiments are well-structured, assessing predictive performance with different sequence identity thresholds, showcasing the model's generalization.
- Using the PDBBind dataset to train ESP—without focusing on data specific to cryptic pockets—demonstrates the model's robustness.

4. **Results and Comparisons**
- The comparison with PocketMiner is comprehensive, highlighting instances where ESP offers clearer, more spatially precise predictions. ROC and PR curves convincingly illustrate the improvement over existing methods.
- However, the concept of "mixing rate" is not sufficiently explored regarding signal distribution in predictions, possibly neglecting aspects of convergence or the dynamic behavior of proteins.

5. **Clarity and Presentation**
The paper is generally clear and well-organized, with sections that appropriately guide the reader through the background, methodology, results, and conclusions. Diagrams illustrating protein structures and prediction outcomes aid understanding. Despite this, a detailed explanation of "mixing rate," if pertinent to model assessment or comparison, could enhance the reader's insight into the temporal aspects of prediction distribution.

6. **Relevance and Impact**
The task of identifying cryptic pockets is crucial for drug discovery, and approaches that do away with laborious MD simulations are highly relevant. Successfully predicting these pockets from sequence data alone could significantly hasten drug discovery processes and optimize resource use.

7. **Limitations and Future Work**
- The paper could provide more insight into false-negative rates, as these affect the prioritization of viable drug targets.
- The integration of MD data with PLM outputs is not explored, which could offer an intriguing avenue for developing a hybrid model in the future.

8. **Conclusion**
In summary, the paper offers an impressive advancement in using PLMs for predicting cryptic ligand binding pockets, demonstrating enhanced accuracy and efficiency compared to current leading methods. While the discussion on the "mixing rate" and further exploration of dynamic protein features could deepen understanding of the model's capabilities, this research is a valuable contribution to computational biology and drug design.
