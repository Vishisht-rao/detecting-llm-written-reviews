Title: Reducing Atomic Clashes in Geometric Diffusion Models for 3D Structure-Based Drug Design

Summary:
The paper tackles the issue of atomic clashes in the Geometric Diffusion Model (GDM), which is used for creating 3D molecular structures in Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD). The authors present an improved sampling method that employs proximal regularization techniques to introduce constraints. This enhancement reduces atomic clashes and respects physical constraints without the need for extra training of the GDM. The approach is validated through tests that show a notable decrease in atomic clashes.

Strengths:
1. **Novelty**: The introduction of a unique constrained sampling method effectively addresses the frequent challenge of atomic clashes in GDMs.
2. **Empirical Evaluation**: Thorough evaluations on standard datasets, like CrossDocked2020, demonstrate a reduction in atomic clashes while maintaining model performance.
3. **Theoretical Foundation**: The method uses well-founded proximal operators to manage non-smooth constraints, with convergence analysis backing its effectiveness.
4. **Practicality**: The enhancement is applicable without retraining the GDM, making it practical for real-world use.

Weaknesses:
1. **Complexity**: The method's explanation may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the mathematical groundwork, particularly concerning proximal operators and convergence analysis.
2. **Visualization and Explanation**: Although visual aids are included, they could be better explained to clearly show how proximal regularization reduces clashes.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: There's a need for more context on how new metrics like Clash Ratio and Stability relate to practical drug design applications.
4. **Generality**: The approach's adaptability and effectiveness should be tested on a wider range of models and datasets, beyond the initial improvements shown in models like TargetDiff.

Suggested Improvements:
1. **Clarification of Concepts**: Simplifying or elaborating on concepts like proximal regularization and Langevin dynamics could make the paper more accessible.
2. **Additional Comparisons**: Including comparisons with other approaches to manage atomic clashes could further validate the proposed method.
3. **Future Directions**: Outlining clearer future research paths or potential integration with "interactive theorem proving" could emphasize the study's impact and future potential in drug design.

Overall, the paper provides valuable insights and improvements in SBDD by addressing key limitations in current methods for managing molecular geometric representations, enhancing reliability without additional model retraining.
