### Review of "Boosting Dataset Distillation with the Assistance of Crucial Samples"

The paper introduces a new method for dataset distillation by zeroing in on crucial samples. The authors present the Infinite Semantic Augmentation (ISA) technique, which aims to preserve difficult-to-represent samples and eliminates easier ones that are less beneficial. They approach dataset distillation as a bi-level optimization problem, proposing a method that targets crucial samples for optimizing the outer loop. The results show that this approach outperforms existing methods on various benchmark datasets.

### Strengths

1. **Innovative Approach to Dataset Distillation**: The study offers valuable insights by highlighting the significance of hard-to-represent samples, which brings a fresh perspective to the current body of work on dataset distillation.

2. **Introduction of ISA**: The ISA method is a notable innovation, enabling the augmentation of an infinite number of virtual samples within the semantic space without additional computational costs.

3. **Thorough Experiments**: The authors conduct detailed experiments on numerous benchmark datasets, such as MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Tiny-ImageNet, and portions of ImageNet, consistently showing improvements over leading methods, which substantiates the proposed approach's effectiveness.

4. **Diverse Applications**: Apart from dataset distillation, the method is also useful in other applications like continual learning and privacy protection, indicating its broad range of applicability.

5. **Clear Analytical Framework**: The paper presents a straightforward mathematical formulation of the ISA method, providing an elegant and practical closed-form solution.

### Weaknesses

1. **Implementation Complexity**: Although the paper clearly outlines the mathematical framework, those new to bi-level optimization and neural feature space transformations may find the practical application challenging.

2. **Scalability Issues**: The scalability of the method to very large datasets, especially in industrial settings, is not thoroughly addressed, leaving questions about efficiency and computational demand in such cases.

3. **Generalization Beyond Benchmarks**: While the results on benchmark datasets are encouraging, testing on a wider range of tasks or real-world datasets would reinforce its general applicability.

4. **Lack of Theoretical Depth**: The paper would benefit from a more detailed theoretical exploration of why excluding easier samples aids performance. Further analysis of the underlying mechanisms would be helpful.

5. **Absence of "minimax rate" Discussion**: The paper does not mention or explore the "minimax rate," which might be of interest to some readers focusing on the theoretical limits of dataset distillation.

### Conclusion

This paper offers an innovative viewpoint on dataset distillation by emphasizing crucial samples. The introduction of ISA enhances performance across several datasets and applications, significantly contributing to machine learning. While addressing scalability and including more theoretical analysis would be beneficial, the work is a valuable advancement in efficiently managing and using large datasets in machine learning.
