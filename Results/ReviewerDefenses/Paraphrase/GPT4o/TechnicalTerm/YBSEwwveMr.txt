**Title**: SCORE-BASED MULTIMODAL AUTOENCODERS

**Review**:

This paper introduces an innovative method to enhance Multimodal Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) using Score-Based Models (SBMs), aimed at boosting the generative quality and coherence across different modalities. The approach presents a new perspective on addressing the drop in generative quality typically observed in traditional multimodal VAEs as more modalities are included, as highlighted by Daunhawer et al. (2022). The paper is clearly structured, and the contributions are methodologically robust, with empirical evidence supporting the claims. Key points from the review are as follows:

1. **Innovativeness and Contribution**:
- The application of SBMs to capture the joint latent space of unimodal VAEs represents a novel idea. This alternative to forming a joint posterior is logically justified by identifying existing method limitations.
- The inclusion of coherence guidance introduces an intriguing dimension to the SBM framework, enhancing the consistency of outputs, particularly when limited modalities are available.

2. **Relevance and Significance**:
- Multimodal learning is pivotal for various applications because of the common presence of multi-modal data. Resolving the scalability and quality issues in current multimodal generative models is crucial.
- By concentrating on maintaining scalability and enhancing quality with more observed modalities, the paper fills a gap in existing research, potentially benefitting real-world multimodal applications.

3. **Theoretical Foundation**:
- The paper offers a solid theoretical underpinning for its approach. The shift from a joint posterior to a joint latent space using SBMs is well-articulated.
- The derivation of the variational lower bound and the discourse on conditional independencies provide strong theoretical support.

4. **Experimental Validation**:
- The experiments conducted on the extended PolyMNIST and CelebAMask-HQ datasets are thorough, demonstrating the advantages of the proposed method in terms of generative quality and scalability.
- The evaluation criteria, like FID and conditional coherence, are suitable, and comparisons with appropriate baselines (e.g., MVAE, MMVAE, MoPoE) bolster the method's effectiveness.
- Scalability tests with a growing number of modalities further validate the claims regarding model efficiency.

5. **Clarity and Presentation**:
- The paper is well-organized, with distinct sections for methodology and results. Figures and tables effectively showcase the method's performance and impact.
- Notation could be clarified in certain mathematical expressions to improve accessibility.

6. **Weaknesses and Concerns**:
- The "plug-and-play" feature, incorporating SBMs with pre-trained unimodal VAEs, may face challenges in achieving optimal outcomes across diverse datasets without significant tuning.
- The paper acknowledges that requiring all modalities during training is a limitation, indicating that additional work is needed to handle cases with partially available modalities.
- The computational cost, particularly during inference, is noted as a trade-off. Explicitly addressing this could enhance the practical applicability of the paper.

**Overall Assessment**:
The paper provides a significant advancement in multimodal generative modeling by combining score-based models with VAEs. The approach is innovative and likely to have a substantial impact, addressing key shortcomings in existing models. Despite some limitations related to computational demands and training prerequisites, the work represents a meaningful step forward in improving multimodal generative models' quality and scalability. The paper merits acceptance, pending minor revisions for clarity and practical considerations.
