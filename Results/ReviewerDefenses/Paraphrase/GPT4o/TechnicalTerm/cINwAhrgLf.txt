PARAPHRASED OUTPUT:
The paper titled "AUX-NAS: Exploiting Auxiliary Labels with Negligibly Extra Inference Cost" presents an architecture-driven approach to auxiliary learning, which aims to improve the performance of primary tasks while keeping inference costs similar to those of single-task networks. This study is well-justified as it tackles the challenges faced by existing optimization-based auxiliary learning methods, which often encounter issues of negative transfer due to conflicting task gradients. The authors introduce a strategy based on Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to create a network that utilizes auxiliary labels through a primary-to-auxiliary task flow. This design enables the avoidance of auxiliary computations during inference, thus reducing computational costs.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach**: The paper introduces a unique architecture-based strategy using a soft parameter sharing scheme, differing from the common optimization-based or hard parameter sharing approaches in multi-task learning (MTL).

2. **Creative Use of NAS**: The approach leverages a NAS algorithm to identify optimal architectures, applying constraints to eliminate superfluous auxiliary-to-primary links, ensuring the final models maintain single-task inference efficiency.

3. **Extensive Experiments**: The method is robustly validated through experiments on various datasets (NYU v2, CityScapes, Taskonomy), tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation, depth estimation), and models (VGG-16, ResNet-50, ViTBase), demonstrating its ability to improve primary task outcomes.

4. **Compatibility with Optimization Methods**: The framework is shown to be compatible with current optimization-based AL techniques, enhancing its practical usability and versatility across different learning paradigms.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Comparison with Recent Advances**: Although comparisons are made with methods like Adashare and PCGrad, the paper could further include evaluations against more recent architecture-based MTL developments, especially those focusing on efficiency and scalability.

2. **NAS Design Complexity**: While the paper claims linear scalability with an increasing number of auxiliary tasks, the specifics of its implementation might be challenging for practitioners less familiar with NAS or those working with large network architectures.

3. **Generalization Issues**: The importance of generalizing from mixed models to single architectures is noted, but more detail could be provided on how the NAS algorithm ensures generalization, particularly when combined with other optimization techniques.

4. **Lack of "Proper Scoring Rule" Discussion**: The concept of "proper scoring rule," important in contexts where model confidence and accuracy interpretation are crucial, is not covered. Including this could enhance the assessment criteria for models involving auxiliary tasks.

**Conclusion:**

This paper offers a significant contribution to auxiliary learning by emphasizing architecture design over traditional optimization methods. The strategic use of NAS to prevent negative transfer while maintaining inference efficiency is impressive and could significantly impact practical applications. However, enhancing the research with more comprehensive comparisons and deeper theoretical discussions on generalization could increase its depth and applicability. In summary, "AUX-NAS" is a notable study on developing networks for effective multi-task and auxiliary learning.
