WATERMARK: hidden confounding
Paper ID: vqIH0ObdqL
PARAPHRASED OUTPUT:
This paper explores an essential and timely issue in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI): the ability of large language models (LLMs) to discern causation from correlation. The study stands out due to its innovative approach, introducing the new task called CORR2CAUSE, which aims to evaluate the inherent causal reasoning skills of LLMs, separate from empirical knowledge.

### Strengths:

1. **Unique and Significant**: The research tackles a rarely addressed issue within AI and NLP, where most studies rely on empirical common-sense knowledge, whereas this paper focuses on formal causal reasoning, a key aspect of human intelligence.

2. **Extensive Dataset**: The authors have developed a large-scale dataset with over 200,000 samples, carefully organized using causal discovery methods like the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm. This dataset is crucial for testing the causal inference skills of LLMs and could serve as a reference for future studies.

3. **Detailed Model Assessment**: The research encompasses a thorough evaluation of a variety of models, ranging from BERT-based models to newer GPT iterations (including GPT-4), offering a complete analysis of current LLMs in terms of causal reasoning.

4. **Revealing Results**: The findings indicate a major flaw in the ability of existing LLMs to conduct causal inference, as their performance is similar to random guessing. This issue persists even after fine-tuning, showing an inability to generalize, especially in different distribution scenarios.

5. **Prospective Research Paths**: The paper outlines potential research directions, such as examining larger graphs and considering "hidden confounding" to develop more complex datasets, which could significantly advance robust AI systems capable of logical decision-making.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Baseline and Evaluation Limitations**: Although the results show poor causal reasoning performance in LLMs, the chosen evaluation metrics could be broadened. Utilizing specific causal inference metrics might yield more detailed insights.

2. **Real-World Application Lacking**: Despite a section on broadening to natural stories, the practical use of the dataset is somewhat vague. More examples or case studies on real-world applications could increase the paper's relevance.

3. **Graph Complexity and Scalability**: The authors note the limitation to graphs of 2 to 6 nodes, and the paper briefly mentions but does not delve deeply into scaling to larger, more complicated causal graphs.

4. **Suggested Solutions**: While identifying the issue is vital, the paper could benefit from offering more tangible strategies or methods to address the recognized limitations in LLMs.

### Conclusion:

The paper serves as a foundational exploration of the causal reasoning abilities of LLMs, an important step toward enhancing AI systems' decision-making processes. It identifies significant gaps in current models, setting a firm base for future efforts to improve LLMs beyond mere empirical knowledge. The dataset and task introduced are valuable to the NLP community, paving the way for new research areas with practical implications for creating more intelligent AI systems.
