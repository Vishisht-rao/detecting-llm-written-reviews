### Review of "Bag of Features: New Baselines for GNNs for Link Prediction"

#### Summary
This paper explores an innovative method for link prediction, presenting an alternative to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The proposed approach, called Bag of Features for Link Prediction (BFLP), uses classic feature extraction techniques combined with conventional machine learning classifiers. The authors offer extensive experimental results showing that the BFLP method matches or even outperforms leading GNN models on various benchmark datasets like CORA, CITESEER, PUBMED, PHOTO, and OGBL-COLLAB.

#### Strengths
1. **Innovative Approach**: The paper provides a refreshing challenge to the conventional dominance of GNNs by applying traditional machine learning methods with specialized features for link prediction.

2. **Robust Feature Engineering**: It thoroughly details the structural and domain-specific features employed in the BFLP model, including both established similarity indices and new modifications that capture node relationships effectively.

3. **Empirical Analysis**: The study presents robust experimental evaluations across multiple datasets, showcasing the BFLP model's competitive edge and, in some cases, superior performance compared to GNN models.

4. **Efficiency**: The computational efficiency of the BFLP model suggests it is scalable, particularly advantageous for large datasets such as those in the Open Graph Benchmark.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Limited Theoretical Depth**: Though the paper offers empirical support for its approach, it lacks comprehensive theoretical insights that could explain why the Bag of Features model sometimes surpasses GNNs.

2. **Feature Generalization**: The reliance on feature engineering might limit the method's applicability across different datasets, and its ability to generalize across various graph types or domains is not thoroughly addressed.

3. **Updated Comparisons**: The paper compares BFLP with a variety of existing models but could be enhanced by including comparisons with the latest methods or those optimized for heterogeneous networks.

4. **Performance on Heterophilic Networks**: While the paper acknowledges this, the approach's less impressive results on heterophilic datasets could benefit from further investigation or improvement.

#### Discussion
This paper significantly contributes by revisiting traditional machine learning approaches for graph-based problems typically dominated by GNNs. It aligns with ongoing discussions about GNN expressivity and suggests that simpler models could be effective in capturing complex graph structures. The introduction of the "Bag of Features" method not only competes with current baselines but also invites the research community to reconsider straightforward methods that recent GNN trends may have overshadowed.

#### Conclusion
The paper offers a strong case for reconsidering traditional techniques in link prediction tasks, backed by solid empirical evidence. However, enhancing the theoretical framework could provide further insights. Although the method shows limitations in heterophilic scenarios, its impressive performance in other contexts and prompting for new GNN improvements make it a noteworthy contribution to the field.

#### Recommendation
I recommend acceptance of this paper at ICLR 2024. It provides a fresh perspective that can inspire future research to blend traditional machine learning approaches with modern deep learning techniques for graph data.

#### Notes
The paper does not address "generative clustering," which seems unrelated to its focus. If such a concept were included, clarifying its role or implications for the discussed methods would be essential.
