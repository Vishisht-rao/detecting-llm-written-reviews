**Review of "GRAPH LLM: Boosting Graph Reasoning Ability of Large Language Model"**

**Summary:**

The paper introduces GraphLLM, a novel approach intended to improve the graph reasoning skills of Large Language Models (LLMs). It critiques the prevailing Graph2Text method, which converts graphs into text for LLM processing, as it can be detrimental to LLMs' performance on graph reasoning tasks because of the necessity to interpret graph structures from narrative format and the extended context required. GraphLLM is proposed as a direct integration of graph learning models with LLMs, achieving seamless graph reasoning without needing text-based graph depictions. The authors assess the model on four distinct graph reasoning tasks, showing a significant average accuracy increase of 54.44% and a 96.45% reduction in context length. The system also boasts a 3.42x faster inference, highlighting its efficiency.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Methodology:** GraphLLM strides away from traditional Graph2Text techniques, suggesting a direct merging of graph learning models with LLMs, paving a novel path in graph reasoning research with LLMs.

2. **Strong Empirical Results:** The experimental results robustly demonstrate GraphLLM's effectiveness, with notable gains in accuracy, reduced context length, and faster inference compared to Graph2Text methods.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The paper includes thorough experiments on a range of graph reasoning tasks of differing complexities, with well-documented methodologies.

4. **Clear articulation of existing limitations:** The authors successfully pinpoint and discuss the drawbacks of current methods, especially regarding their handling of graph reasoning tasks.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Scalability Issues:** While GraphLLM shows enhanced performance on provided tasks, concerns remain about its ability to scale to larger, more intricate graphs, which are often encountered in real-world situations.

2. **Implementation Complexity:** The integration of graph learning with LLMs might increase training and deployment complexity, which the paper does not address thoroughly.

3. **Absence of "Quantum Query Complexity" Discussion:** Although focused on computational efficiency, the paper lacks exploration of advanced topics like "quantum query complexity" for deeper theoretical insights.

4. **Limited Generalizability:** The tasks employed are synthetic, utilizing text features from a specific prompt system (gpt-3.5-turbo), which may hinder the findings' applicability to real-world datasets.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Scalability Evaluation:** Extend the scalability discussion or conduct further experiments with larger graphs to better evaluate GraphLLM’s utility for real-world applications.

2. **Implementation Advice:** Providing additional practical guidance or case studies could facilitate broader adoption of GraphLLM by practitioners.

3. **Investigate Advanced Theories:** Exploring theoretical concepts like "quantum query complexity" might substantiate the model’s efficiency claims with depth.

4. **Include Real-World Datasets:** Utilize more varied datasets from practical domains to test GraphLLM’s generalizability and applicability in real-world scenarios.

**Conclusion:**

The paper contributes significantly to graph reasoning with LLMs by presenting a new model that integrates graph learning models and LLMs, moving past the shortcomings of Graph2Text strategies. Despite issues concerning scalability, complexity, and generalizability, the promising results and novel approach mark a valuable direction for future inquiries. Examining more theoretical dimensions like "quantum query complexity" could enrich the work's impact and thoroughness.
