**Title:** IMITATION LEARNING FROM OBSERVATION WITH AUTOMATIC DISCOUNT SCHEDULING

### Summary:
The paper introduces an innovative method called Automatic Discount Scheduling (ADS) to address Imitation Learning from Observation (ILfO) tasks that depend on gradual progress. The main contribution is the dynamic adaptation of the discount factor in reinforcement learning based on the agent's learning stages. This technique enables the agent to concentrate on mastering early behaviors before advancing to later stages. The effectiveness of ADS is highlighted through nine tasks in the Meta-World suite, where it shows significant improvements compared to leading ILfO methods.

### Strengths:
1. **Innovative Method:** The paper presents a unique approach (ADS) for adaptively scheduling the discount factor in tasks with sequential learning processes. This provides an elegant solution to a complex issue, underscoring the role of learning heuristics in such tasks.

2. **Extensive Testing:** The authors have conducted thorough experiments across nine Meta-World tasks, demonstrating that their method generally outperforms existing techniques in both task success rate and sample efficiency.

3. **Adaptability and Strength:** By testing different proxy-reward-based methods with ADS, the paper showcases its adaptability and strength, as it enhances multiple existing methods.

4. **Reproducibility:** The authors provide access to the code and use sufficient random seeds in their experiments, ensuring the results can be reproduced.

### Weaknesses:
1. **Complexity Concerns:** Despite promising empirical results, the paper lacks a detailed examination of computational costs or overhead from dynamically adjusting the discount factor and tracking progress. Understanding the balance between performance enhancements and computation could boost ADS's practical relevance.

2. **Relying on Progress Recognizer:** The approach depends on the accuracy of the progress recognizer in assessing the agentâ€™s learning stages. Discussing any limitations or edge cases of this recognizer's performance in more detail could be beneficial.

3. **Applicability in Other Domains:** The focus is mainly on manipulation tasks within the Meta-World suite, without exploring how ADS performs in other domains with different state or action spaces, such as decision-making or navigation tasks.

4. **Comparison with Other Approaches:** The paper does not include a thorough comparison with other dynamic curriculum approaches. Although some adaptive strategies were tested, a more detailed exploration of scheduling options and their interpretability would strengthen the discussion.

### Conclusions:
This paper offers an impressive solution to a recognized challenge in ILfO with progress-dependent tasks, introducing a method that is both innovative and effective. Although ADS shows significant performance gains, further investigation into computational overheads and wider applications is warranted. Despite certain areas needing further exploration, this work significantly contributes to imitation learning research, providing a robust base for exploring adaptive learning strategies in the future.
