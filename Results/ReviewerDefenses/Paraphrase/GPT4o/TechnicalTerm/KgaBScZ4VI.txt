**Review of "Language Model Cascades: Token-Level Uncertainty and Beyond"**

*Summary:*

This paper explores using cascading language models to optimize the balance between cost and quality in generative tasks. It argues that deferral decisions should go beyond traditional sequence-level uncertainties, which are often based on log probabilities, by utilizing token-level uncertainty measures instead. The authors propose using quantiles of these probabilities for deferral decisions and show that learning a post-hoc deferral rule with these quantiles can enhance performance.

*Strengths:*

1. **Innovative Approach:** The introduction of token-level probability quantiles as a criterion for cascading models is a fresh concept, challenging traditional sequence-level confidence measures.

2. **Thorough Empirical Study:** The paper provides a detailed evaluation across various NLP tasks, offering strong evidence for the effectiveness of quantile-based deferral strategies.

3. **Integration with Model Embeddings:** The research explores how combining embeddings from both smaller and larger models can improve cascade performance, offering a nuanced take on standard cascades.

4. **Clear and Detailed Presentation:** The methodology, ablation studies, and experimental setups are well-documented, with detailed explanations and supplementary appendices.

*Weaknesses:*

1. **Increased Complexity and Costs:** The need for quantile-based rules and intermediate embeddings could complicate real-world implementation and increase costs, potentially undermining the intended efficiency of cascading strategies.

2. **Guidance on Quantile Selection:** While various quantiles are tested, the paper doesn't provide clear advice or rationale for choosing the optimal ones across different domains. A learning-based approach is mentioned, but further exploration of consistently effective quantiles is needed.

3. **Lack of Discussion on Set Operations:** The impact of "set operations" in applying cascade decisions across multiple responses is not addressed, though these operations could be vital in ensemble or consensus scenarios.

4. **Theoretical Justification:** The use of quantiles is primarily supported by empirical results. The paper would benefit from theoretical insights into why quantiles might better capture uncertainty than sequence-level measures.

5. **Broader Applicability:** Focusing mainly on FLAN-T5 models, the paper would gain from applying its strategies to a wider range of architectures, such as decoder-only models like GPT or those trained with RLHF, for more comprehensive insights.

*Recommendations for Improvement:*

1. **Cost Analysis:** Including an evaluation of the computational and cost implications of the proposed methods compared to standard approaches would enhance practical relevance.

2. **Guidance on Quantile Choice:** Providing clear guidelines or algorithms for selecting appropriate quantiles would help practitioners apply the results more effectively.

3. **Theoretical Insights:** Adding theoretical justification for the superiority of token-level quantiles over sequence-level approaches would strengthen the paper's argument.

4. **Comparative Analysis:** Wider comparisons with other advanced deferral decision metrics or existing uncertainty quantification methods, beyond traditional classification techniques, would enrich the study.

Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution by suggesting richer uncertainty measures for cascade methods in generative models, though areas like practical implementation and theoretical support could be further refined.
