**Title:** Class-Incremental Learning with Parameter-Efficient Cross-Task Prompts

**Summary:**

This paper introduces a new framework called Parameter-Efficient Cross-Task Prompt (PECTP) for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) scenarios. The framework addresses challenges associated with rehearsal-free and memory-limited CIL by employing a fixed number of prompts. To increase the adaptability and effectiveness of these prompts in various tasks, the authors incorporate a Prompt Retention Module (PRM). This module functions on two levels: Outer Prompt Granularity (OPG) and Inner Prompt Granularity (IPG), which ensures the prompt parameters are robust as tasks progress. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that PECTP outperforms existing prompt techniques in terms of efficiency and performance.

**Strengths:**

1. **Relevance to Current Challenges:** The paper tackles an important issue in incremental learning, particularly in contexts where data privacy concerns restrict rehearsal techniques. The focus on memory constraints is pertinent given today's increasingly large and complex machine learning models.

2. **Innovative Methodology:** The use of two-level constraints (OPG and IPG) for prompt evolution introduces a novel way to balance learning new tasks and retaining old ones, potentially reducing catastrophic forgetting.

3. **Thorough Experimentation:** The experiments conducted on a range of datasets effectively demonstrate the PECTP framework's efficiency. The results consistently show improvements over baseline and the latest methods, supporting the proposed solution's effectiveness.

4. **Methodological Insights:** The paper provides additional insights into optimizing prompt-based models for CIL tasks by exploring how classification layers are initialized.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Presentation Clarity:** While the main contributions are clear, some sections, especially those detailing implementation specifics and the PRM components, could be explained more clearly. Figures and equations are sometimes not sufficiently interpreted in the text, which may confuse readers.

2. **Ablation Study Details:** The ablation study sheds light on the PRM module's functioning, but more details on the memory cost versus accuracy trade-offs (e.g., prompt-length configurations) would improve understanding.

3. **Task "Hardness" Consideration:** The paper contributes effectively to existing methodologies but doesn't thoroughly explore the "hardness" of different tasks or how this might affect prompt retention or retrieval across different datasets.

4. **Generalization Capacity:** Though results are promising, how well the PECTP framework can adapt to real-world, dynamic environments remains uncertain due to the controlled nature of the benchmark datasets used.

**Recommendations for Future Research:**

1. **Application to Real-World Scenarios:** Future research should investigate how PECTP performs in real-world settings where data arrives in a more unstructured or unpredictable fashion than the current experiments suggest.

2. **Wider Benchmark Inclusion:** Expanding the range of datasets, especially those involving significant domain shifts or overlapping tasks, could provide a more comprehensive analysis of the framework's effectiveness.

3. **Incorporating Task Hardness:** Introducing explicit measures of task "hardness" in the learning process might further enhance the adaptability and performance of prompt-based approaches.

In summary, the paper presents an innovative approach to CIL in environments with memory constraints, focusing on parameter efficiency and robust evaluation across varied datasets. Addressing the mentioned areas could significantly boost the framework's impact and applicability in the field of incremental learning.
