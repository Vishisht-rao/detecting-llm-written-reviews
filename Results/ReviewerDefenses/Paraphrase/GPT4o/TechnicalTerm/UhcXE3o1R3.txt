**Review of "APOLLO: Zero-Shot Multi-Modal Reasoning with Multiple Experts"**

1. **Summary:**

This paper introduces APOLLO, a groundbreaking framework designed to harness multiple pre-trained foundation models from various modalities to handle complex multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot context. The approach avoids the need for prompt engineering and specialized multi-modal training by suggesting a decentralized model where different transformer models exchange their expertise. The authors exhibit APOLLO's proficiency through stylized image captioning and a novel task, audio-aware image captioning, showing its superior performance compared to semi-supervised state-of-the-art models, all without additional training.

2. **Strengths:**

- **Innovative Approach:** APOLLO's framework that enables interaction among different models without relying on prompts is novel. By eliminating language as a middle step, it addresses the limitations seen in Socratic models.

- **Performance Improvement:** The paper notes significant improvements in style accuracy and text-image correspondence, particularly on SentiCap and FlickrStyle10K benchmarks.

- **Adaptability to New Tasks:** The successful introduction of audio-aware image captioning underscores the method's flexibility and potential for application to other multi-modal tasks.

- **Comprehensive Methodology:** The paper offers a detailed account of the gradient updates for guiding models, enhancing the study's reproducibility through clear technical descriptions.

3. **Weaknesses:**

- **Empirical Evidence:** Although the results are encouraging, broader testing across more tasks or datasets would better validate APOLLO's generalizability and performance.

- **Comparison to Prompt-dependent Models:** Comparing APOLLO mainly with zero-shot or prompt-based models may not fully demonstrate its superiority over other approaches. A more varied set of baselines could offer a better understanding of its pros and cons.

- **Inadequate Discussion on Interference:** There's a lack of discussion on potential interference issues when multiple models interact and the impact of expert models' interactions on overall performance.

4. **Clarity:**

- The paper is generally well-structured, with clear sections for motivation, methodology, results, and related work. However, a deeper theoretical discussion on why non-prompt integration is beneficial compared to prompt-based methods could add depth.

- The technical details are well-explained, especially concerning the experts' loss functions and gradient updates. Additional examples or visualizations of model interactions might help in illustrating these ideas more clearly.

5. **Significance:**

- The approach is timely and could significantly advance zero-shot learning in multi-modal scenarios. This contribution may open new avenues for developing adaptable AI systems capable of reasoning across modalities without heavy retraining or dependency on prompts.

6. **Evaluation Metrics:**

- The evaluation metrics, such as CLIPScore, style accuracy, and fluency, are suitable. The combination of qualitative analyses with quantitative metrics offers a balanced assessment of APOLLO's abilities.

7. **Overall Recommendation:**

Given the innovative approach, the positive empirical outcomes, and the wide applicability potential, I recommend that this paper be accepted for the conference. However, it would greatly benefit from an extended discussion on limitations like "interference" and a more comprehensive comparison with a wider array of baseline models.

8. **Suggestions for Improvement:**

- A discussion on APOLLO's scalability as the number of experts grows would be beneficial.

- Expanding on possible interference scenarios and mitigation strategies would strengthen the paper.

- Including a broader range of tasks in the evaluation could further showcase APOLLOâ€™s versatility.

In summary, the paper offers a promising approach that could make significant contributions to multi-modal AI research.
