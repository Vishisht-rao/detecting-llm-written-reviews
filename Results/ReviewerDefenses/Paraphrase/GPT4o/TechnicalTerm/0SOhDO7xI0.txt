**Review of "DeepDRK: Deep Dependency Regularized Knockoff for Feature Selection"**

**Summary**

This paper presents Deep Dependency Regularized Knockoff (DeepDRK), a method based on deep learning designed for feature selection that aims to keep the false discovery rate (FDR) in check while maximizing selection power. DeepDRK builds on the Model-X knockoff principle, using a transformer-based generative model to produce knockoffs that reportedly adhere more closely to the swap property than current methods. The authors suggest new regularization strategies, such as a multi-swapper adversarial training approach and dependency regularization using sliced-Wasserstein metrics, to enhance feature selection. The method is tested on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real datasets, showing better performance than existing deep learning-based knockoff techniques in scenarios with small sample sizes and complex data patterns.

**Strengths**

1. **Innovative Method:** Applying transformer architectures for knockoff generation is novel, utilizing recent deep learning advancements to improve dependency capture.

2. **Reconstructability Focus:** The paper tackles the reconstructability issue, vital for enhancing feature selection power in high-dimensional settings.

3. **Comprehensive Testing:** The method is evaluated across various datasets, including synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world, offering robust performance insights.

4. **Thorough Analysis:** The paper provides a detailed presentation of theoretical aspects, methodology, experimental design, and offers extensive appendices for additional depth.

**Weaknesses**

1. **Increased Complexity:** The inclusion of new components like multi-swapper adversarial training and sliced-Wasserstein metrics makes the approach more complex. While each component is independently justified, their combined complexity might increase training overhead and challenge reproducibility and implementation.

2. **Baseline Limitations:** Although DeepDRK is compared to several advanced methods, the absence of traditional statistical or simpler knockoff baseline comparisons may obscure its relative performance improvements.

3. **Interpretability Concerns:** While dependency regularization is discussed, the paper could offer more intuition on how different regularization strengths empirically influence the FDR and power trade-off.

4. **Lack of "Mirror Prox" Discussion:** The absence of "mirror prox" discussions is noted, which might be relevant when addressing optimization or adversarial training from a game theory perspective.

**Clarity**

- The paper is generally well-structured with clear explanations, but it presumes considerable background knowledge in advanced statistical learning and optimal transport, which could be challenging for less experienced readers.

- Performance metrics and results are effectively illustrated through figures and tables.

**Recommendations**

1. **Simplification:** Simplify the framework or clearly differentiate essential components from additional enhancements to improve accessibility.

2. **Expand Baselines:** Include traditional and straightforward models in baseline comparisons to clearly demonstrate the added value of DeepDRK.

3. **Theoretical Clarifications:** Enhance the theoretical discussion on regularization techniques, possibly providing theoretical bounds or guarantees.

4. **Discuss Limitations:** Offer a thorough discussion on potential application areas along with a candid evaluation of limitations, particularly concerning computational demands.

In summary, DeepDRK is a promising development for feature selection within the Model-X knockoff framework, effectively using modern machine learning approaches to tackle the challenges posed by complex data distributions and small sample sizes. With further refinement and broader baseline comparisons, it could make significant contributions to the field of feature selection.
