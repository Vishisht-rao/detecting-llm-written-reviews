**Paraphrased Review of "Expressive Losses for Verified Robustness via Convex Combinations"**

The paper introduces a new category of loss functions, "expressive losses," aimed at enhancing the balance between adversarial robustness and standard accuracy in neural networks. Current methods typically force a choice between robustness (at the cost of accuracy) or accuracy (at the cost of robustness). The authors present a single parameter, the over-approximation coefficient, which allows for smooth transitioning between adversarial and verified loss, thereby tailoring training to achieve the desired balance. This approach is demonstrated through models like CC-IBP, MTL-IBP, and Exp-IBP, noted for being straightforward yet effective.

**Strengths:**

1. *Innovative Concept*: The notion of "expressive losses" is novel, offering a fresh take on integrating adversarial attacks with over-approximations to enhance robustness-accuracy balance.

2. *Robust Experimental Support*: The work is backed by thorough evaluation over various datasets, such as CIFAR-10, TinyImageNet, and a reduced version of ImageNet, where the proposed methods often surpass existing techniques.

3. *Well-Articulated Explanation*: The description of the methods is mostly clear, with a detailed discussion on trade-offs and the role of the hyper-parameter \( \beta \).

4. *Strong Theoretical Foundation*: The paper effectively details the theory behind using convex combinations to enhance expressivity, making a strong case for their application.

**Weaknesses:**

1. *Absence of Comparison with "Principled Methods"*: Despite strong experimental results, the paper would benefit from comparisons with "principled methods" that emphasize formal robustness guarantees.

2. *Hyper-Parameter Sensitivity*: While the over-approximation coefficient \( \beta \) is fine-tuned, thereâ€™s limited exploration of sensitivity to other hyper-parameters like attack strength or initialization choices. Additional insights on these would be helpful.

3. *Details on Computational Resources*: The paper outlines different computational setups but lacks an in-depth discussion on the resources needed for training and verification in various scenarios.

4. *Interpretability Complexity*: Although the theoretical aspect is straightforward, a clearer presentation of the practical implementation of "expressive loss" methods with adversarial examples could encourage wider adoption.

**Conclusion:**

In summary, the paper offers a significant contribution to the field by addressing the persistent challenge of balancing accuracy and robustness in model training. The "expressive losses" approach is both sound in theory and effective in practice. While there is room for improvement in linking the approach to broader theoretical frameworks and detailing computational facets, the paper is apt for presentation at a top-tier conference like ICLR, pushing forward the dialogue on neural network robustness and paving the way for future research.
