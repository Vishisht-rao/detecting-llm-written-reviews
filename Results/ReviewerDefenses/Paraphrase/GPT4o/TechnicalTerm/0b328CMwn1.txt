PARAPHRASED OUTPUT:
**Summary and Contributions**:
The paper introduces a new concept called "activation prompt" (AP), aimed at improving visual prompting (VP) techniques for adapting large pre-trained models to specific vision tasks. Unlike traditional input-level VP, AP integrates perturbations into activation maps within the model's intermediary layers. The authors demonstrate that AP outperforms VP both in performance and efficiency, especially when paired with normalization tuning techniques like batch and layer normalization. With extensive experiments on 29 datasets across different architectures, the paper shows that AP consistently achieves higher accuracy and computational efficiency compared to VP.

**Strengths**:

1. **Innovative Concept**: The introduction of "activation prompt" is a creative advancement over traditional VP, addressing the limitations of input-level perturbations.

2. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The paper conducts extensive experiments over 29 datasets, offering a solid comparison of AP with VP and several PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) methods.

3. **Strong Theoretical Basis**: It provides a theoretical explanation for the enhanced performance of AP, viewed through the lens of global feature extraction across layers.

4. **Practical Relevance**: AP's efficiency in terms of parameters, memory, and computation presents significant advantages for using pre-trained models on devices with limited resources.

5. **Clear Explanations**: The authors effectively highlight the drawbacks of traditional VP and emphasize the benefits of AP across different architectures.

**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement**:

1. **Limited Baseline Variety**: While AP is compared with input-level VP and some PEFT methods, the paper could benefit from including comparisons with "energy-based models" or attention-based prompting, where relevant, to paint a broader competitive picture.

2. **Complex Theoretical Section**: The theoretical explanations are detailed but may be too complex for beginners, especially regarding normalization tuning and layer-specific properties.

3. **Extension to Other Modalities**: The focus is primarily on vision tasks; exploring AP's potential in other modalities such as text or multimodal scenarios could be valuable.

4. **Risk of Overfitting**: The paper could discuss in more detail the risk of overfitting, particularly in scenarios with limited data.

5. **Model Size Discussion**: While the paper mentions AP's dependency on pre-trained model size for accuracy, a more elaborate discussion would provide deeper insight into its applicability across different model scales.

**Clarity and Presentation**:

- The organization of the paper helps make a complex subject understandable, though further simplification or intuitive explanations in the theoretical sections could enhance clarity.

- Figures and tables effectively display empirical findings, but more visual comparisons of architecture-specific AP implementations would be beneficial.

**Conclusion**:
The paper marks a noteworthy advancement in visual prompting by shifting from input to activation prompts. Its insights into enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of adapting large pre-trained models are valuable. Despite room for improvement in theoretical clarity and broader applicability, the research is solid and offers promising prospects for future exploration and practical applications in the rapidly evolving area of pre-trained model deployment.
