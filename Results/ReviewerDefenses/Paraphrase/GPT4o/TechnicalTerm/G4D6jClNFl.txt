### Review of "Deepfake Detection with Contrastive Learning in Curved Spaces"

#### Summary

The paper introduces a new technique for deepfake detection named CTru (Contrasted learning in opposite-curvature space). This method utilizes both hyperbolic and hyperspherical spaces to refine feature representation in facial images. The main innovation involves using multiple-curvature spaces to represent facial geometry, addressing the shortcomings of current deepfake detection methods that rely on Euclidean assumptions. The method combines self-supervised learning with anomaly detection, mostly employing real face images during training. The detector shows exceptional generalization across various datasets and manipulation techniques, setting new state-of-the-art performance benchmarks.

#### Strengths

1. **Innovative Representation Learning**:
- Employing different geometric spaces (hyperbolic and spherical) and incorporating Busemann distance is creative. This method appears to effectively capture the intricate geometric properties of human faces, effectively distinguishing them from deepfakes.

2. **Strong Generalization**:
- The proposed approach surpasses current methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation scenarios, indicating strong adaptability to various forms of deepfakes and previously unseen data.

3. **Efficiency and Simplicity**:
- The method does not depend on deep networks like ViT nor require fake examples for training, thus streamlining the training process and achieving quick inference speeds.

4. **Thorough Evaluation**:
- The paper demonstrates CTru's effectiveness through extensive experiments, covering various scenarios and comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques, enhancing the reliability of its findings.

5. **Robustness**:
- The analysis includes examining robustness against different perturbation methods, maintaining consistent performance even with alterations.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Clarification on "Model Based Optimization"**:
- The paper lacks clarity on the mention or use of "model-based optimization," concentrating more on representation learning. Clarifying optimization strategies would improve understanding.

2. **Complexity of Curved Spaces**:
- Although the approach effectively uses complex geometric spaces, it introduces considerable complexity, which could benefit from more intuitive explanations or visual aids for a diverse audience.

3. **Practical Application**:
- The paper emphasizes the theoretical and technical foundation but could improve by discussing challenges of real-world deployment or computational resource requirements for real-time applications.

4. **Ablation Studies**:
- The ablation study provides insights into individual components (e.g., different loss functions) but could further explore how each geometric space specifically aids in detecting fraud.

5. **Reliance on Prototypes**:
- Dependence on evenly distributed prototypes for learning might imply constraints or limitations regarding scalability or adaptability to other domains, which isn't thoroughly addressed.

#### Conclusion

The paper significantly contributes to deepfake detection, particularly in addressing the geometric complexity of human facial structures. The innovative use of hyperspherical and hyperbolic spaces, coupled with rigorous experimental validation, positions CTru as a major advancement in the field. Enhancing the accessibility of complex concepts and addressing potential real-world limitations would further improve the method's applicability and comprehensibility.
