**Review of "Symbol as Points: Panoptic Symbol Spotting via Point-based Representation"**

**Overview:**
This paper introduces an innovative technique for panoptic symbol spotting in computer-aided design (CAD) drawings by representing graphical elements as collections of 2D points. The proposed approach, called SymPoint, aims to overcome the limitations of traditional raster and graph-based neural network methods that struggle with CAD-specific characteristics. SymPoint utilizes a point transformer for feature extraction and a spotting head similar to mask2former for output predictions. Key innovations include the Attention with Connection Module (ACM) and Contrastive Connection Learning (CCL), which utilize local connections among graphical elements. Additionally, a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) interpolation method is employed for improved mask downsampling, specifically tackling the unique challenges associated with CAD drawings.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Methodology:** The paper presents a unique perspective by modeling CAD drawings as point sets, potentially leading to enhanced data processing efficiency and improved model performance through reduced computational complexity.

2. **Robust Experimental Outcomes:** Comprehensive experiments on the FloorPlanCAD dataset demonstrate marked improvements in performance metrics (PQ and RQ) compared to leading-edge approaches like GAT-CADNet.

3. **Technical Soundness:** The introduced methods, particularly ACM and CCL, are well-supported by existing literature. The authors effectively validate their innovations through ablation studies, showcasing the value of each component.

4. **Significant Practical Implications:** The approach is highly relevant for symbol spotting in architectural and interior design, suggesting important possibilities for automation in these fields.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity and Clarity:** Certain sections of the paper may be dense and difficult for readers not well-versed in point cloud processing and CAD terminologies. Enhancing clarity, possibly with additional visual aids or examples, would improve comprehension.

2. **Concerns Over Computational Efficiency:** Although the authors claim their point-based approach is computationally efficient, further empirical evaluation of how well the model scales with larger datasets or more intricate CAD drawings would bolster their argument.

3. **Interpretability Issues:** The heavy reliance on attention mechanisms raises concerns about the interpretability of complex interactions learned by the model, which could limit trust and understandingâ€”crucial factors in design applications.

**Recommendations for Enhancement:**
1. **Improve Clarity:** Revise sections with complex mathematical details to enhance understandability, particularly for readers lacking deep knowledge of the relevant technologies.

2. **Expand Dataset Testing:** The authors should consider testing SymPoint on a wider range of datasets, including real-world examples with varying levels of complexity in CAD drawings.

3. **Include Real-Time Performance Testing:** A performance analysis focusing on speed and efficiency in practical scenarios, including feedback from design professionals, would provide deeper insights into the tool's real-world applicability.

**Conclusion:**
The work on SymPoint is both innovative and significant, offering valuable contributions to the field of panoptic symbol spotting in CAD drawings. The methodological advancements are promising and highly relevant to industry applications. The paper is generally well-structured and technically robust, with potential for further progress in CAD processing frameworks. Minor adjustments for clarity and broader evaluations would strengthen its overall impact and accessibility.

**Citation Reference:**
The paper references "Gottlieb et al. (2023)" concerning earlier studies on point-based representations, emphasizing the continuing evolution of methodologies in computer vision.

**Recommendation:**
I recommend accepting the paper, contingent on addressing the suggested improvements prior to final publication.
