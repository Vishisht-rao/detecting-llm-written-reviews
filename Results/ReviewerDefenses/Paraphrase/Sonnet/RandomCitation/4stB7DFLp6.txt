**Review of "InstructRetro: Instruction Tuning Post Retrieval-Augmented Pretraining"**

**Summary:**
This paper introduces a groundbreaking large language model (LLM) named InstructRetro 48B, noted as the largest LLM that has undergone pretraining with retrieval before instruction tuning. The authors implement a method termed "retrieval-augmented pretraining," investigating its effects on the zero-shot performance of the model across various question-answering (QA) tasks. The main concept involves extending the pretraining of a 43B GPT model with an additional dataset comprising 100 billion tokens, utilizing the retrieval enhancement technique—different from previous strategies that imposed restrictions on model size and training data. The outcomes show significant improvements in both perplexity and zero-shot QA performance for InstructRetro when compared to earlier models.

**Strengths:**
1. **Scale and Innovation**: InstructRetro 48B, as the largest retriever-augmented LLM developed to date, showcases a major leap forward in large-scale language models. The authors convincingly argue that enhancing pretraining efforts can lead to more effective performance during instruction tuning phases.

2. **Thorough Evaluation**: The authors conduct a careful analysis of InstructRetro's zero-shot performance relative to leading current models in both short-form and long-form QA scenarios. Their zero-shot evaluation framework is well-organized, utilizing various datasets that mirror real-world use cases.

3. **Retrieval-Augmented Methodology**: The results highlight the advantages of integrating retrieval techniques into the training of language models, especially in domains requiring extensive factual knowledge. By demonstrating that additional pretraining benefits from retrieval augmentation, the authors effectively support their methodological approach.

4. **Clear Contributions**: The authors distinctly communicate their contributions, especially the insight that unfreezing the decoder improves performance metrics—crucial knowledge for future studies.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity and Clarity**: While detailed, the paper may at times overwhelm readers with technical terms and intricate architectural descriptions. Simplifying certain explanations or offering more context for specialized terms could enhance accessibility for a wider audience.

2. **Insufficient Baseline Comparisons**: Though valuable comparisons with existing models are presented, a more detailed discussion of the limitations or weaknesses of current state-of-the-art methods could provide a clearer contextual framework for understanding InstructRetro's improvements.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**: The emphasis on perplexity and EM scores, while conventional in the field, may not fully reflect the model's efficacy in more nuanced scenarios or user-centric real-world applications. Incorporating qualitative metrics or user-driven evaluations could strengthen the assessment further.

4. **Overlooked Limitations**: The paper could better address the limitations or potential biases tied to the extensive datasets used for training, including ethical implications, data sourcing issues, and possible inaccuracies.

**Minor Comments:**
- While the citations of previous research bolster the paper's credibility, there is some inconsistency in the citation format in certain areas (for instance, "Keil et al. (2016)" is introduced but not subsequently fully detailed). Ensuring thorough references and consistent formatting is essential for academic rigor.
- Some figures and tables, though informative, could improve in clarity through better labeling and enhanced captions.

**Conclusion:**
InstructRetro showcases an innovative and effective strategy for employing retrieval-augmented pretraining, which substantially boosts the zero-shot capabilities of large language models. While the methodology and technical intricacies are commendable, improvements in presentation clarity and commentary on limitations would further enhance the paper. Overall, this research makes a notable contribution to the advancement of artificial intelligence and natural language processing, setting a significant benchmark for future investigations into retrieval-augmented frameworks.
