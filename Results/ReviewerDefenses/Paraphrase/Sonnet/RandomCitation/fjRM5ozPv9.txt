### Review of "Local-Forward: Towards Biological Plausibility in Deep Reinforcement Learning"

#### Summary
This paper introduces Local-Forward, a new learning algorithm and architecture designed to address the biological implausibility of backpropagation in deep reinforcement learning (RL). The authors propose a framework that substitutes backpropagation with local updates tailored for each layer of a neural network, while also integrating forward connections through time to improve information flow. The paper is organized effectively, outlining the rationale for the study, the theoretical foundation, algorithmic innovations, and empirical assessments across different RL tasks in the MinAtar environments.

#### Strengths
1. **Biological Justification**: The rationale for developing a more biologically plausible learning method is clearly conveyed, with a strong emphasis on the limitations of backpropagation from a biological perspective. This sets a solid groundwork for their proposed approach.

2. **Innovative Contributions**: The Local-Forward algorithm, which exclusively utilizes local updates and temporal forward connections, marks a significant advancement in aligning artificial neural networks with biological learning processes. The shift to using local TD error instead of global error propagation is both original and encouraging.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: The paper presents thorough experimental data showcasing the effectiveness of Local-Forward in comparison to standard DQN models across various environments. The findings indicate that Local-Forward performs similarly to, and in certain instances, outperforms traditional methods.

4. **Clarity and Structure**: The writing is mostly clear, and the paper is well-organized, aiding comprehension of complex topics. Illustrative figures detailing the network architecture and processes enhance the understanding of the proposed method.

5. **Discussion of Biological Implications**: The authors discuss the biological relevance of their method, linking their results to existing studies on dopamine signaling and biological reinforcement learning, which significantly enriches the contribution.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Insufficient Comparisons**: While comparisons are made between Local-Forward and a baseline DQN model, the lack of a thorough evaluation against other cutting-edge reinforcement learning algorithms like Rainbow or MuZero limits the insights into Local-Forward's effectiveness and constraints. 

2. **Generalizability Concerns**: Although positive results are reported in the MinAtar environments and some classic control tasks, testing the algorithm in more complex scenarios would enhance understanding of its robustness and applicability.

3. **Failure Modes and Limitations**: While the authors acknowledge certain limitations, a more detailed investigation into the failure modes observed—particularly in more challenging environments like Seaquest—would be beneficial for guiding future enhancements.

4. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Although the paper includes hyperparameter settings, it does not delve into how sensitive Local-Forward is to these parameters or the tuning process itself. An analysis of the effects of hyperparameter adjustments on performance would offer valuable insights for future use.

5. **Citations and References**: The review notes that the paper cites "Pelton et al. (2015)," which appears unrelated to the context of this research. This suggests that a more careful referencing approach is necessary to clearly communicate related work and its relevance.

#### Conclusion
The paper introduces an impressive and innovative strategy for enhancing biological plausibility in deep reinforcement learning. The Local-Forward framework is well-supported by empirical evidence, presenting itself as a viable alternative to backpropagation. Nonetheless, future studies should address the identified limitations, especially regarding comparative evaluations with contemporary algorithms and robustness assessments in diverse conditions. The authors' work has the potential to pave the way for new research opportunities in both artificial intelligence and neuroscience, meriting further investigation.

#### Recommendation
- **Minor Revision**: Overall, the paper is strong but would improve by addressing the noted weaknesses, particularly regarding broader comparative analyses and more detailed examinations of failure modes. These modifications could significantly enhance the paper's influence.
