**Review of “An Extensive Analysis on the Underlying Premises Behind Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Design”**

The paper in question provides a thorough examination of how deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms perform when moving from high-data to low-data scenarios. The authors highlight a critical overdependence on the assumption that performance traits identified under high-data conditions will seamlessly apply to low-data situations. This analysis is particularly relevant in light of the rapid developments and shifting methodologies occurring within the reinforcement learning field.

**Strengths:**

1. **Theoretical Contributions**: The authors contribute significantly to the existing body of work by proposing a theoretical framework that clarifies the lack of transferability of performance metrics across varying sample complexities. By establishing theoretical limits that differentiate low-data from high-data scenarios, they effectively challenge the common belief that high-performing algorithms in one setting will consistently perform well in another.

2. **Robust Experimental Validation**: Utilizing the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) for experimentation is appropriate, and the extensive empirical analysis bolsters the paper's arguments. By comparing multiple algorithms in both low and high-data contexts, the authors provide solid evidence for their theoretical claims. The experimental findings reveal distinct performance variations among different algorithms and data availability, which is crucial for informing future research efforts.

3. **Comprehensive Review**: The paper offers a detailed literature review, incorporating numerous significant references, thus showcasing its strong foundation in current reinforcement learning research. 

4. **Practical Implications**: The insights derived from the study hold essential implications for both researchers and practitioners. The conclusions drawn can aid in developing future DRL algorithms that are more adaptable to changes in the volume of training data.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Clarity and Structure**: Although the theoretical and empirical contributions are meaningful, the presentation could be better organized. Certain sections are heavily laden with mathematical content, which may overwhelm readers who are less versed in the theoretical aspects. Simplifying the presentation or providing more context to motivate the theoretical results could enhance accessibility.

2. **Experimental Details**: While the experiments are extensive, providing a more detailed account of the experimental setup, including hyperparameters, would improve reproducibility. The supplementary materials should clarify how variations in parameters (such as random seeds and exploration strategies) might have affected the outcomes.

3. **Citations and Context**: The paper effectively cites numerous prior works, but more clarity on how their findings relate to other contemporary studies would be beneficial, particularly those that might contradict or validate the authors' conclusions. For example, the reference to "Strang et al. (2019)" lacks sufficient context and attention from the paper's main arguments, which could confuse readers unfamiliar with the cited work.

**Conclusion:**

In summary, the paper makes a significant contribution to the exploration of deep reinforcement learning by addressing an important gap regarding the transferability of performance metrics across different data conditions. The combination of theoretical insights and experimental validation offers a valuable resource for future studies. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to enhance clarity and contextual detail.
