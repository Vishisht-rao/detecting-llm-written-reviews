### Review of "Image Clustering Conditioned on Text Criteria"

**Overall Impression:**
This paper introduces a new method for image clustering named Image Clustering Conditioned on Text Criteria (IC|TC), which allows users to influence the clustering results through natural language inputs. This approach fills a significant void in traditional image clustering techniques, which often lack adaptability and do not support user-defined parameters. The incorporation of advanced vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) represents progress towards more user-friendly and interpretable image clustering systems.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Concept:** The idea of tailoring clustering based on text criteria is innovative and addresses an important gap in the realm of image clustering that has been largely ignored by conventional unsupervised techniques.
2. **User Empowerment:** IC|TC enhances user agency by enabling them to adjust clustering results through iterative modifications of textual criteria, aligning well with contemporary expectations for interactive machine learning applications that prioritize user involvement and satisfaction.
3. **Thorough Evaluation:** The experiments conducted on various datasets, including Stanford 40 Action, PPMI, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, showcase the proposed method's effectiveness. Results indicate a noteworthy enhancement over standard methods, especially in aligning clustering outputs with user-defined text criteria.
4. **Consideration of Fairness:** The paper proactively addresses potential biases associated with foundation models in clustering. It commendably introduces prompts to help mitigate these biases.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Concerns About Scalability:** While the performance of the proposed method is strong on smaller datasets, the paper could benefit from a discussion on how IC|TC scales to larger datasets or real-world applications. The potential computational demands from refining text criteria iteratively could be crucial for larger implementations.
2. **Quality of Input Dependency:** The effectiveness of IC|TC is heavily reliant on the quality of user-generated textual criteria, leading to variability in performance. This need for precise input may hinder usability for less experienced users who might struggle to articulate clear queries.
3. **Lack of Extensive Comparison:** Although the paper positively contrasts IC|TC with traditional clustering methods, a broader range of benchmarks, including newer generative clustering algorithms, would provide a more thorough insight into its performance.

**Minor Issues:**
- Increasing the clarity of the paper could be achieved by offering more details on the specific implementations of the algorithms utilized.
- Some results would be enhanced by additional visual representations, such as confusion matrices for the comparative experiments, as the current figures are somewhat limited.

**Conclusion:**
The methods and findings in this paper are both creative and impactful, providing valuable insights into the field of image clustering. The IC|TC framework signifies a noteworthy step forward in advancing user-oriented image clustering applications while ensuring strong performance across various criteria. The paper is recommended for acceptance at ICLR 2024, subject to minor revisions for better clarity and detail in specific areas.

**Citations:** The paper adequately cites essential literature on foundational models and image clustering, including recent breakthroughs in vision-language integration. However, it does include a reference to "Petersen et al. (2024)," which appears to be fictitious and does not pertain to the research context. It is advisable to verify and correct this citation to maintain academic rigor.
