**Review of "Modeling Complex Vector Drawings with Stroke Clouds"**

**Summary:**
This paper introduces a new generative model for complex vector illustrations, named the "Latent Stroke Cloud Generator" (LSG). The authors propose using "stroke clouds" to portray vector drawings, which consist of sets of n-dimensional Bézier curves of various sizes. By leveraging De Finetti’s Theorem of Exchangeability, the method learns compact latent representations of these stroke clouds, enabling both the probabilistic reconstruction of existing vector drawings and the generation of new samples that mimic the training distribution. The model's effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments on a synthetic dataset created from the Danbooru2019 database, focusing on intricate anime line-art illustrations.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Methodology:** The paper represents a significant shift from conventional sequential generative models by adopting a set-based projection, addressing the limitations of previously used sequential approaches, and effectively managing complex drawings.

2. **Strong Theoretical Foundation:** By applying De Finetti's Theorem, the proposed method is well-grounded theoretically, ensuring effective representation of the variable-length distributions found in vector drawings.

3. **Thorough Experimental Validation:** The authors validate their model extensively using the newly developed Anime-Vec10k dataset, providing various quantitative and qualitative results that showcase the model's ability to generate complex vector sketches effectively.

4. **Promising Practical Applications:** The findings have potential applications in the fields of digital art, animation, and other creative areas, particularly due to the necessity for scalable and editable complex drawings.

5. **Well-Organized Presentation:** The paper is clearly structured, with organized sections detailing the methodology, experimental findings, and a thoughtful discussion on the implications of the results.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Dataset Limitations:** While the creation of the Anime-Vec10k dataset is noteworthy, the use of synthetic data may limit the complexity and variation of actual hand-drawn sketches. A discussion on how these findings relate to real hand-drawn art could enhance the paper.

2. **Insufficient Comparative Analysis:** Although the paper details its improvements over prior methods, a more comprehensive empirical comparison with state-of-the-art vector drawing generation techniques, such as "Shane et al. (2016)" from ICLR 2022, would clarify the advancements of the proposed model.

3. **Concerns About Over-sampling:** The authors acknowledge that over-sampling can lead to visual artifacts but do not thoroughly explore potential solutions to mitigate this issue during the generative process. Offering concrete strategies could improve the method's practical utility.

4. **Limited Variability Exploration:** While the paper indicates that under-sampling negatively affects visual quality, it does not address adaptive sampling techniques or how different models might cope with this issue. Including such discussions would provide deeper insight into model variability.

**Conclusions:**
In conclusion, "Modeling Complex Vector Drawings with Stroke Clouds" makes a significant contribution to generative modeling, especially in the vector art domain. The original use of stroke cloud representation, along with a solid theoretical basis and rigorous experimental validation, renders the paper compelling. Addressing the noted weaknesses could further boost its relevance and utility for both academic research and industry applications.

**Recommendation:** Accept with minor revisions.
