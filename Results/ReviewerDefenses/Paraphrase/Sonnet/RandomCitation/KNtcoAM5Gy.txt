**Review of “BAFTA: BACKPROP-FREE TEST-TIME ADAPTATION FOR ZERO-SHOT VISUAL LANGUAGE MODELS”**

**Summary:**
This paper introduces BAFTA (Backpropagation-Free Test-Time Adaptation), a new method aimed at improving the performance of zero-shot visual-language models like CLIP during inference. The approach avoids the conventional complications associated with backpropagation-based test-time adaptations, especially the challenge of determining an ideal learning rate without validation data. Instead, it applies online clustering to directly adjust class centroids in a projected embedding space and uses Rényi entropy to consolidate predictions. The experimental findings demonstrate that BAFTA consistently surpasses leading methods like TPT (Test-Time Prompt Tuning) and shows significant enhancements across various datasets.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Contribution:** The development of a backpropagation-free method is notable as it addresses a crucial challenge in test-time adaptation. The emphasis on estimating centroids via online clustering in a combined visual-text embedding space is both original and applicable.

2. **Thorough Evaluation:** The authors present extensive empirical data showcasing the effectiveness of their method across several benchmarks, such as ImageNet and fine-grained classification datasets. The performance improvements over established techniques reinforce the paper's claims.

3. **Clarity and Organization:** The paper is well-structured, providing clear explanations of the problem, the proposed method, and the advantages of BAFTA compared to existing methods. The authors effectively convey the motivations behind their design choices, allowing readers to grasp the rationale behind the approach.

4. **Ablation Studies:** The ablation studies throughout the paper deepen the understanding of how various components contribute to overall performance, particularly highlighting the effectiveness of embedding projection and prediction aggregation methods.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Insufficient Complexity Analysis:** While the approach is innovative, the paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion of its computational complexity in comparison to prior methods. Such information is crucial for practitioners looking to implement the model in real-time scenarios.

2. **Limited Examination of Edge Cases:** The study mainly addresses average performance across datasets. An exploration of how BAFTA handles edge cases, such as classes with few examples or imbalanced datasets, would provide additional insights into the method's robustness.

3. **Citations and Context Issues:** Although the literature review is robust, the reference to “Steele et al. (2014)” appears to be out of context and does not significantly support the arguments made. This should be corrected to uphold the integrity of the literature review.

4. **Future Work Expansion:** While the authors touch on potential directions for future research, a more detailed discussion on possible enhancements and applications of BAFTA could offer valuable perspectives to the research community.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, the paper presents a significant advancement in adapting visual-language models at test time without backpropagation. The experimental validation indicates that BAFTA is a practical approach for enhancing zero-shot classification in real-world applications. It is likely to generate considerable interest within the machine learning community, particularly among those working with visual-language modalities. Addressing the mentioned weaknesses could further enhance the contributions of this research.

**Recommendation:** Accept with minor revisions.
