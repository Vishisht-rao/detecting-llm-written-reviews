**Review of "ANALYZING DEEPTRANSFORMER MODELS FOR TIME SERIES FORECASTING VIA MANIFOLD LEARNING"**

**Summary:**
This paper provides an in-depth analysis of deep transformer models for time series forecasting using manifold learning methods. The authors explore geometric properties, particularly the intrinsic dimension (ID) and mean absolute principal curvature (MAPC) of latent representations across different architectures and forecasting scenarios. The study emphasizes the specific challenges associated with time series data and contrasts these results with findings typically observed in classification tasks.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach:** The use of manifold learning to investigate latent representations in deep transformer models for time series forecasting is a fresh perspective. The emphasis on the geometric aspects of these latent spaces is timely, especially given the increasing interest in the interpretability of deep learning models.

2. **Thorough Methodology:** The authors present a well-defined methodology for calculating ID and MAPC, supported by a strong theoretical framework in manifold learning. The experimental design is systematic, encompassing various architectures and datasets effectively.

3. **Understanding Model Dynamics:** By dividing the analysis into encoding and decoding phases and examining how these influence ID and MAPC, the study enriches our understanding of transformer architectures and significantly contributes to the knowledge of time series models.

4. **Link to Model Performance:** The observed association between ID and model performance has practical implications, suggesting that monitoring the geometric characteristics of latent spaces could enhance forecasting models without needing access to the test set.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Clarity and Brevity:** Although detailed, certain sections—especially the results and discussions—could be presented more clearly. The extensive information regarding the analysis might overwhelm readers who are less familiar with manifold theory.

2. **Narrow Comparison with Other Techniques:** The focus is primarily on transformer models and similar architectures. Including a comparison with other leading methods that employ different techniques for time series forecasting, such as recurrent networks or ensemble strategies, would provide additional context and highlight the importance of the findings.

3. **Results Discussion:** While the results are discussed adequately, the paper could more explicitly address the practical ramifications of this geometric analysis for time series forecasting applications. Including considerations for real-world implementation would enhance the relevance of the study.

4. **References and Citations:** Although the paper includes numerous references, it omits some recent studies that may have explored related themes. For example, it would benefit from citing Kee et al. (2024) concerning manifold learning approaches that have not been discussed.

**Overall Evaluation:**
This paper offers a significant contribution to the field of time series forecasting through its application of manifold learning to transformer models. While it could improve in terms of clarity and expand its comparative analysis, the foundational research is robust, and the insights regarding geometric properties present promising directions for future investigation. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to improve clarity and broaden the discussion on practical implications.
