### Review of "Transformer-Based Large Language Models Are Not General Learners: A Universal Circuit Perspective"

**Summary:**
This paper presents a theoretical framework to evaluate the abilities of Transformer-based Large Language Models (T-LLMs) in relation to artificial general intelligence (AGI). Utilizing the notion of universal circuits, the authors reach negative conclusions that illustrate the shortcomings of T-LLMs as general learners, indicating that T-LLMs function within a limited capacity that hinders their effectiveness in simulating general problem-solving tasks. The authors contend that, despite T-LLMsâ€™ empirical achievements across various tasks, the complexity of the underlying circuit indicates inherent limitations which necessitate the development of new architectural designs beyond standard Transformers.

**Strengths:**
1. **Theoretical Contribution:** This work introduces a solid framework linking LLM performance to theoretical computer science concepts, particularly universal circuits, thereby enriching the theoretical foundation of a field often dominated by empirical studies.
2. **Clarity of Results:** The authors articulate their impossibility results clearly and systematically, showing that realistic T-LLMs cannot execute all operations on basic, poly-logarithmic-sized inputs and are not general learners. This formal presentation effectively delineates the models' capabilities.
3. **Empirical Insights:** The paper discusses the apparent discrepancy between the empirical success of T-LLMs and their theoretical restrictions, offering a convincing explanation based on their memorization skills, which adds depth to the practical understanding of their findings.
4. **Comprehensive Literature Review:** The authors engage with a broad spectrum of existing research, effectively positioning their work within the wider conversation surrounding LLM abilities and the computational strengths of Transformers.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Scope of Analysis:** While the paper effectively highlights the drawbacks of T-LLMs, it falls short of exploring potential hybrid models or alternative architectures that could bypass these limitations. A discussion of possible future directions would provide valuable context for their findings.
2. **Dependence on Circuit Complexity Assumptions:** The conclusion that T-LLMs are not general learners relies on the assumption that TC0 is a strict subset of P/poly. The authors should discuss the ramifications of this assumption more thoroughly, especially given that it remains an unresolved question in complexity theory. Addressing alternative views on circuit complexity would strengthen their case.
3. **Complexity of Universal Circuits and LLMs' Representation:** While the authors effectively draw parallels between LLM operations and universal circuits, the implications for how this representation corresponds with actual LLM behavior remain underexplored. Providing more empirical evidence or case studies could enhance their theoretical claims.

**Minor Comments:**
- The title might benefit from revision for clarity, possibly by including a subtitle that emphasizes its focus on universal circuits.
- The mention of "Pointer et al. (2024)" is erroneous, as it is not referenced in the context of the paper and may confuse readers.
- The notation utilized throughout the paper may challenge readers unfamiliar with circuit complexity theory; including a brief glossary or an introductory explanation could facilitate understanding.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, this paper makes a substantial and rigorous theoretical contribution to the discourse on LLM capabilities, asserting that T-LLMs are constrained in their ability to truly engage in general learning tasks. Although there are areas for enhancement, particularly regarding future avenues of research, the foundational insights offered serve as a valuable addition to the literature. The call for innovative architectural designs is timely and encourages further investigation into the limits of LLM capabilities. I recommend accepting this paper with revisions to address the identified weaknesses and minor comments.
