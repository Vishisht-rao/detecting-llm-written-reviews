**Review of "INTERACTIVE MODEL CORRECTION WITH NATURAL LANGUAGE"**

**Summary:**
This paper introduces C LARIFY, a new framework that empowers users to make interactive corrections to misconceptions in image classifiers using natural language feedback. The authors contend that standard supervised learning often produces models that depend on misleading correlations, which hinders their generalization capabilities. C LARIFY allows individuals without expert knowledge to provide succinct, conceptual feedback instead of requiring comprehensive, specific annotations, thus lowering the costs associated with data labeling.

The experimental results highlight C LARIFY's effectiveness in enhancing model accuracy on datasets known for spurious correlations, specifically Waterbirds and CelebA, achieving an average worst-group accuracy increase of 7.3%. The findings also reveal that C LARIFY identifies 31 previously unrecognized spurious correlations within the ImageNet dataset.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Methodology**: Utilizing natural language feedback for model correction taps into the innate ability of humans to spot mistakes without needing extensive machine learning knowledge. This approach seeks to make the improvement of algorithms more accessible to a wider audience, allowing more users to participate in model enhancement.

2. **Robust Empirical Evidence**: The paper provides strong experimental data comparing C LARIFY to both zero-shot methods and conventional automated bias detection techniques. The reduction of bias through user engagement represents a valuable contribution to the field and a practical move towards mitigating real-world biases in machine learning.

3. **Scalability Potential**: By emphasizing targeted feedback rather than comprehensive instance-level supervision, C LARIFY demonstrates promising scalability for large datasets—a necessary feature for implementing models in settings with significant data volumes.

4. **Comprehensive Discussion of Related Work**: The paper effectively contextualizes its contributions within the existing body of literature, clearly distinguishing how C LARIFY both diverges from and aligns with other significant methodologies.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited User Study Size**: The user study included only 26 non-expert participants. Although the results are encouraging, expanding the participant base could further validate the findings and ensure a broader spectrum of feedback across different backgrounds.

2. **Variability in Feedback Interpretation**: While users achieved notable enhancements, the paper could further address the difficulties related to interpreting textual feedback. A more in-depth discussion on how the wording of user feedback impacts the efficacy of model retraining, especially for complex or ambiguous concepts, would be beneficial.

3. **Uncertainty around Novelty Assertions**: While the framework successfully identified 31 new spurious correlations, it would be helpful for the authors to address the potential for prior knowledge of these correlations beyond the referenced literature, ensuring a fuller understanding of the contribution’s novelty.

4. **Limited Scope for Specialized Applications**: The authors acknowledge that the current framework may not be broadly applicable to highly specialized fields like medical imaging. Clarifying how C LARIFY could be adapted for such areas would strengthen the paper's overall impact.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, this paper significantly contributes to tackling the issue of spurious correlations in machine learning through an innovative method that harnesses human intuition. The empirical findings support the proposed approach's viability, making a compelling argument for its applicability in real-world settings. Considering the identified strengths and weaknesses, I recommend accepting the paper for presentation at ICLR 2024, with suggestions for addressing the weaknesses to enhance clarity and depth in the final submission.

**Recommendation: Accept with Minor Revisions.**

**Citations:** The paper references various works in machine learning and human-centered design, notably including "Guth et al. (2018)," which could benefit from a deeper exploration of methodologies and results related to this study's findings.
