### Review of "Entropy is Not Enough for Test-Time Adaptation: From the Perspective of Disentangled Factors"

#### Overview
This paper introduces a fresh perspective on Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) through a method known as "Destroy Your Object" (DeYO), which features a new confidence metric called Pseudo-Label Probability Difference (PLPD). The authors contend that relying exclusively on entropy as a confidence metric can result in poor sample selection and adaptation, especially during spurious correlation shifts. By employing PLPD, DeYO seeks to lessen the impact of latent disentangled factors on model predictions and enhance performance in diverse scenarios, including biased and extreme conditions.

#### Strengths
1. **Innovation**: The proposed approach demonstrates creativity in overcoming the shortcomings of current TTA methods. By emphasizing the limitations of entropy under shifting data distributions, the authors provide essential insights into the impact of spurious correlations on predictions.

2. **Robust Experimental Evidence**: The comprehensive experimental outcomes across a range of benchmarks (ImageNet-C, ColoredMNIST, Waterbirds, ImageNet-R, and Visda-2021) showcase the effectiveness of DeYO. Consistent enhancements over baseline methods in various contexts (mild, biased, wild) substantiate the authors' claims.

3. **Theoretical Insights**: The introduction of a theoretical proposition concerning harmful samples, particularly linked to TRAP and CPR factors, provides a strong basis for the proposed method. This theoretical underpinning adds to the paper's credibility.

4. **Clear Presentation**: The paper is cohesively structured, logically transitioning from motivation to methodology and results. The figures and tables effectively convey findings, particularly in showcasing how DeYO surpasses baseline models.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Narrow Focus on Disentangled Factors**: Although the paper emphasizes shape information as a CPR factor, it also recognizes the challenge of identifying all CPR factors in an image, which could restrict the method's effectiveness in situations where other key CPR factors may exist yet go unaddressed.

2. **Reliance on PLPD**: In contexts where local features heavily influence predictions, depending on PLPD may not provide significant advantages, as noted in the paper. While the authors acknowledge this limitation, exploring alternative sample identification strategies beyond PLPD would be beneficial.

3. **Potential Computational Costs**: While the authors indicate that PLPD incurs minimal overhead, a more detailed discussion on the practical ramifications of deploying DeYO in real-world scenarios (such as computational demands and time efficiency) would bolster the conclusions of the paper.

#### Additional Comments
The paper references "Miller et al. (2022)" in the background literature; however, it is essential to clarify the relevance of this citation concerning the current research context. The authors should also consider discussing the potential implications of their findings for future TTA research, particularly regarding the incorporation of additional disentangled factors and alternative confidence metrics.

#### Conclusion
In summary, the paper significantly contributes to the TTA field by identifying the drawbacks of traditional entropy-based confidence metrics and proposing a new approach to address these issues. While it holds promise, several limitations should be acknowledged for a comprehensive view. Further exploration of additional disentangled factors and practical implementation aspects would enhance the research's depth. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address these concerns.
