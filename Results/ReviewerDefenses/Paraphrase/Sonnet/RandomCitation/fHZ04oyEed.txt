**Review of "Representation Learning from Interventional Data"**

**Summary:**
The manuscript introduces an innovative technique referred to as RepLIn, which enhances the utilization of interventional data in representation learning. It establishes a link between the predictive success on interventional data and the statistical independence of features during interventions, suggesting a method that explicitly incorporates these independence principles throughout training. The authors validate RepLIn's effectiveness using a synthetic dataset (WINDMILL), image classification tasks on CelebA, and robustness tests against noise in CIFAR-10C and ImageNet-C. Key contributions include identifying the relationship between interventional accuracy and feature dependence, introducing the RepLIn method, and empirically demonstrating its advantages in comparison to established baselines.

**Strengths:**
1. **Noteworthy Originality:** The approach of enforcing statistical independence among features during training, grounded in a causal framework, represents a significant advancement, particularly in contexts where interventional and observational data distributions diverge.

2. **Thorough Empirical Validation:** The authors conduct extensive experiments with a well-organized evaluation framework across various datasets, showcasing the robustness and versatility of RepLIn. Combining synthetic data with real-world benchmarks enhances the clarity of the findings.

3. **Effective Problem Identification:** The paper successfully outlines the difficulties faced by practitioners when handling interventional data, particularly underscoring the shortcomings of existing methodologies that neglect the underlying causal models.

4. **Clear Presentation:** The manuscript is generally well-structured and articulates complex concepts effectively. The inclusion of schematics, causal diagrams, and visual aids aids in comprehending the methods and outcomes.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Insufficient Limitation Discussion:** Although the authors demonstrate RepLIn's effectiveness, there is a lack of an in-depth examination of the scenarios or assumptions under which the method may not perform as well. Addressing the robustness of the approach across various intervention types or causal structures would provide a fuller perspective.

2. **Limited Method Comparison:** While the paper contrasts RepLIn with conventional techniques like ERM and ERM-Resampled, it would be advantageous to include comparisons with additional methodologies from the causal inference domain to better position RepLIn within a wider framework.

3. **Need for Theoretical Depth:** The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive theoretical basis supporting RepLIn. While empirical outcomes are presented, a theoretical rationale for the advantages of enforcing independence would bolster the validity of the method.

4. **Minor Typographical Issues:** Certain sections contain minor typographical errors and clarity concerns (for instance, where "Dayton et al. (2016)" is referenced without sufficient elaboration), which divert attention from the main content.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Add a discussion on the limitations and potential challenges of the proposed method.
- Broaden the comparisons of RepLIn to include a wider array of techniques, particularly those grounded in causal inference.
- Enhance the theoretical justification for the approach.
- Conduct proofreading to correct typographical mistakes and improve clarity, particularly in citations and references.

**Overall Recommendation:**
The paper makes a novel contribution to representation learning by adeptly tackling the issue of learning from interventional data. The RepLIn method shows potential, supported by robust empirical evidence across diverse tasks. Consequently, I recommend accepting the paper with minor revisions to address the identified weaknesses.
