**Review of "Foundation Model-oriented Robustness: Robust Image Model Evaluation with Pretrained Models"**

This paper introduces a new method for evaluating the robustness of image models using a metric called Foundation Model-oriented Robustness (FMR). The authors contend that traditional evaluation methods, which often depend on fixed benchmarks, do not effectively reflect the complexities of real-world conditions where machine learning models function. They suggest a technique for dynamically generating perturbed datasets that preserve the original image-label relationships while leveraging the capabilities of various foundation models like CLIP.

### Strengths:
1. **Innovation and Timeliness**: The paper tackles an important issue in current machine learning evaluation practices. As the deployment of models in varied real-world contexts becomes more common, there is a growing need for robust evaluation metrics that can accommodate variations in data distribution.

2. **Detailed Methodology**: The authors provide an in-depth explanation of their approach for generating images using foundation models. Utilizing pre-trained models as references to ensure the integrity of image-label connections introduces a novel and impactful element to the assessment of robustness.

3. **Extensive Experimental Work**: The experiments conducted cover a range of datasets and model architectures, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. The findings demonstrate FMR's capability to uncover robustness issues that traditional metrics may miss.

4. **Valuable Insights**: The paper offers a new way to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different models, particularly through the generated perturbed images that expose model reliance on texture versus shape.

### Weaknesses:
1. **Implementation Complexity**: Though the methodology is thorough, its intricacy might hinder widespread adoption. The dependence on a collection of foundation models and the elaborate image generation methods may necessitate significant computational resources and expertise, which could be a limitation for smaller research teams.

2. **Realism of Generated Images**: The authors occasionally mention that the generated images may not look realistic. While this is acceptable for illustrating model vulnerabilities, it raises concerns about the applicability of these images in tasks requiring realistic visual representations.

3. **Limited Discussion on Societal Bias**: The paper points out potential biases associated with large foundation models and discusses their societal implications. However, this area could be further developed by including specific examples or case studies that demonstrate these biases and their impacts more concretely.

4. **Lack of Comparison with Other Methods**: The authors could better contextualize their method's effectiveness by comparing it more thoroughly to existing robustness evaluation frameworks. Although they note the drawbacks of static benchmarks, a detailed comparative analysis could reinforce their claims regarding the benefits of their approach.

### Conclusion:
This paper represents a meaningful advancement in robust machine learning evaluation by proposing a method that moves beyond static benchmarks towards dynamic assessments based on foundation models. The promise of FMR to provide deeper insights into model robustness is noteworthy, but increased accessibility and practical implementation will need further refinement and validation. The exploration of societal biases is significant, emphasizing the ethical considerations that must be taken into account in machine learning research.

### Recommendation:
I encourage the acceptance of the paper with minor revisions to enhance the discussion of biases, improve considerations of practical application, and strengthen comparisons with current evaluation methods.

**Citations for consideration**: The authors appropriately reference relevant literature throughout the work. However, including examples that highlight the challenges associated with these approaches, as mentioned in "Salinas et al. (2018)," could enrich the theoretical framework of their arguments.
