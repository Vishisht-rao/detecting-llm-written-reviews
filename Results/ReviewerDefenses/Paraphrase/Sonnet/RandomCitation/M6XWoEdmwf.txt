**Review of "AMAGO: Scalable In-Context Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Agents"**

**Summary**:

This paper presents AMAGO, a new in-context reinforcement learning (RL) agent that utilizes long-sequence Transformers to enhance generalization, long-term memory, and meta-learning. The authors claim that AMAGO overcomes significant barriers in off-policy learning for in-context agents, especially regarding scalability and performance in environments with sparse rewards. They support the effectiveness of AMAGO through various empirical experiments in multiple problem areas, such as meta-RL, long-term memory tasks, and goal-conditioned challenges.

**Strengths**:

1. **Innovative Methodology**: The revision of the off-policy actor-critic update to accommodate long-sequence Transformers represents a noteworthy advancement in the field. By tackling the issues related to memory capacity and planning horizons, AMAGO aims to extend the capabilities of existing approaches in meta-RL and sparse reward exploration.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The thorough experimental evaluation against recognized benchmarks (particularly the POPGym suite) demonstrates AMAGO's strong performance compared to current methods. The authors also introduce new benchmarks that support the AMAGO framework, enhancing its validity as a resource for further research.

3. **Detailed Technical Explanation**: The thorough explanation of the methods and design choices (such as multi-gamma learning and the relabeling strategy) clarifies the functionality and application of AMAGO. This transparency aids in replication and future investigations of the framework.

4. **Open-source Code**: The authors have made their code accessible to the public, promoting community involvement and allowing for further research based on their outcomes.

**Weaknesses**:

1. **Theoretical Framework**: While the empirical findings are encouraging, the paper could benefit from a stronger theoretical basis explaining why AMAGO's adaptations outperform earlier methods. A more detailed discussion of the significance of architectural decisions, particularly regarding memory retrieval and its effects on decision-making in RL, would deepen the reader's insight.

2. **Hyperparameter Challenges**: The section on hyperparameter tuning could be elaborated. While AMAGO shows less sensitivity to hyperparameters compared to other methods, providing specific examples of hyperparameters that might still need careful adjustment would be helpful for users looking to apply this agent in various contexts.

3. **Limited Benchmarks Against Other Advanced Actors**: Although AMAGO demonstrates strong performance against certain benchmarks, the paper mainly compares it with specific agents like GRU and efficient Transformer variants. Including comparisons with more recent top-performing RL agents could offer further clarity on AMAGO's strengths.

4. **Application to Real-world Scenarios**: The experiments mainly involve simulated settings. Discussing the potential issues that might arise when implementing AMAGO in real-world applications would give a more holistic understanding of its strengths and weaknesses.

**Minor Comments**:
- The writing is generally clear; however, some parts could be better organized. Improving the logical flow, particularly in the methods and results sections, by clustering related concepts would enhance clarity.
- The citation of "Messenger et al. (2020)" is relevant within the reinforcement learning discourse, but a clearer explanation of its connection to the current work would be helpful.

**Conclusion**:
In conclusion, "AMAGO: Scalable In-Context Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Agents" offers notable contributions to the field of reinforcement learning by presenting a scalable agent aimed at long-term memory and goal conditioning. Although there are minor weaknesses, the paper's strengths, such as innovative methodology and strong empirical support, suggest it is a valuable addition to the conference proceedings. It would benefit from a more comprehensive theoretical discussion and a broader comparison with the latest advancements in the field. I recommend acceptance with a suggestion to address the identified areas in a revision.
