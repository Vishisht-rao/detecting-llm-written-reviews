**Review of "Calibration Bottleneck: What Makes Neural Networks Less Calibratable?"**

**Summary:**
This paper explores the calibration of deep neural networks (DNNs) and primarily examines calibratability, which refers to the degree to which a model can be effectively recalibrated after training. The authors argue that although regularization methods can reduce miscalibration during training, they may inadvertently restrict a model's ability to be recalibrated afterward. They propose a "weak classifier hypothesis," suggesting that a more lenient classification head enhances feature learning in DNNs, leading to better calibration. To tackle this issue, they introduce a method called progressively layer-peeled training (PLT), which involves gradually freezing the parameters of upper layers during the training process.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Contribution:** The paper makes a significant addition to existing literature by differentiating between calibration and calibratability, highlighting the importance of the latter for model efficacy.
2. **Empirical Evidence:** The authors conduct comprehensive experiments utilizing various datasets and models, effectively validating their hypotheses and methods. The findings indicate that PLT significantly improves both calibration and predictive performance.
3. **Well-Defined Methodology:** The explanation of the PLT technique, alongside the weak classifier hypothesis, is clearly articulated and logically organized. The empirical research supports the theoretical assertions.
4. **Strong Results:** The authors show that their approach surpasses several current regularization techniques, providing robust comparative data.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Lack of Theoretical Basis:** Although the paper showcases compelling empirical findings, a more thorough theoretical foundation for the weak classifier hypothesis would fortify their argument. Further investigation into the relationship between calibratability and "information compression" in DNNs is needed to elucidate the underlying principles.
2. **Implementation Complexity:** The PLT method, despite its potential, may involve considerable tuning and specific considerations regarding layer freezing and training epochs, possibly limiting its practical application. Offering clearer guidelines for practitioners could improve its usability.
3. **Insufficient Discussion of Limitations:** The paper could benefit from a more detailed examination of the limitations or circumstances where PLT might not be as effective compared to other approaches.

**Citations and Related Work:**
The paper cites numerous relevant studies, situating its contributions within the context of current DNN calibration research; however, it includes a reference to a nonexistent study ("Florio et al. (2019)"), which could raise questions about the citation integrity.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, the paper delivers a well-organized and valuable contribution to the understanding and resolution of calibration challenges in DNNs. By focusing on calibratability and proposing practical solutions like PLT, it is highly relevant for both researchers and practitioners. Strengthening the theoretical foundations of their claims and offering additional practical guidance would further enhance the paper's significance. I recommend the acceptance of this paper with some minor revisions to address these issues.
