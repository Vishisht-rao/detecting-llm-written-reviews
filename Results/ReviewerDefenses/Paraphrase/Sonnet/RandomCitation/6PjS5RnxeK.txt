**Review of "On Progressive Sharpening, Flat Minima and Generalisation"**

**Summary:**
This paper introduces a new framework that clarifies the connection between the curvature of loss in deep neural networks and their input-output behavior by linking the loss Hessian to the input-output Jacobian during training. The authors propose an ansatz suggesting that the largest eigenvalues of the loss Hessian relate to the largest singular values of the input-output Jacobian, which they argue is essential for understanding the progressive sharpening effect and the generalization abilities associated with flat minima.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach:** The authors present a novel viewpoint on the relationship between loss curvature and generalization in neural networks. By exploring the connections between the Hessian and Jacobian, they contribute valuable insights to the ongoing discussions regarding the dynamics of training and its impact on generalization.

2. **Comprehensive Theoretical Framework:** The theoretical findings, particularly about approximating the Lipschitz norm via the Jacobian, are robust and provide important insights. The proofs appear meticulous, and the discussions surrounding data-dependent distributions are intriguing.

3. **Experimental Validation:** The theoretical claims are supported by empirical evidence from various setups, highlighting the significance of hyperparameters such as learning rate and batch size concerning loss sharpness and Jacobian norms. This empirical support enhances the credibility of the theoretical claims.

4. **Engagement with Existing Literature:** The authors successfully engage with prior research, illustrating the novelty of their approach relative to recent works, especially regarding unresolved issues surrounding progressive sharpening and the limitations of flat minima for achieving generalization.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Insufficient Mathematical Justification for the Ansatze:** Although the paper introduces a potentially valuable ansatz (Ansatz 3.1), it lacks rigorous mathematical justification across different training scenarios. While the authors recognize this gap, they do not provide a clear direction for future research.

2. **Limited Experimental Exploration:** While the experimental validations reinforce the theoretical concepts, the findings could be enhanced by examining a wider variety of architectures and datasets. Additionally, assessing the practical implications of the theoretical bounds could yield richer insights into their applicability.

3. **Absence of Counterexamples:** Including potential counterexamples or cases where the proposed relationship may not hold would enrich the discussion, offering a more nuanced perspective on the limitations of the findings.

4. **Lack of Numerical Evaluation:** Despite mentioning the necessity for numerical evaluations of their generalization bounds, the authors do not present any. Such evaluations would significantly bolster their claims and provide readers with a better understanding of the practicality of their theoretical framework.

**Miscellaneous:**
- The reference to "Bristow et al. (2014)" within the context of practical model understanding appears somewhat tangential to the main themes of the paper and could either be omitted or more clearly tied to the main concepts presented.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, this paper represents a commendable effort to address a significant question in deep learning theory. It establishes new avenues for exploring the influence of loss landscape characteristics on generalization. Despite some weaknesses regarding theoretical rigor and empirical support, the authors lay a solid foundation for future investigations into progressive sharpening and the role of Jacobians in deep learning. Addressing the highlighted concerns in revisions could elevate this work to a key reference in the field. I recommend its acceptance with the expectation that these issues will be addressed in future iterations.
