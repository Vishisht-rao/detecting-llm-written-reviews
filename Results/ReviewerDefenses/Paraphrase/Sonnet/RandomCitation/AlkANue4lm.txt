### Review of "Non-Redundant Graph Neural Networks with Improved Expressiveness"

**Summary:**

This paper introduces an innovative framework aimed at improving the expressiveness of graph neural networks (GNNs) by tackling the issues with message passing frameworks, particularly concerning information flow and computational redundancy. The authors suggest a new aggregation method using neighborhood trees, specifically through the implementation of k-redundant neighborhood trees (k-NTs), which minimizes redundancy. Their findings indicate that this method enhances expressiveness beyond what is achievable with conventional message passing techniques, like those based on the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithm. The paper is supported by strong theoretical insights and comprehensive experimental outcomes using both synthetic and real datasets.

**Strengths:**

1. **Theoretical Contributions:** The authors provide a robust theoretical framework, establishing a meaningful connection between redundancy and expressiveness, which adds valuable perspective to current GNN discussions. Their demonstration that k-redundant neighborhood trees outperform the WL method in expressiveness contributes significantly to the understanding of graph embeddings.

2. **Innovative Techniques:** The inclusion of a neural tree canonization technique and an in-depth analysis of redundancy represents a fresh contribution that could inspire further research in the field. These methods show considerable potential and constitute a significant methodological enhancement over existing techniques.

3. **Thorough Evaluation:** The extensive experiments conducted across multiple tasks and datasets effectively validate the superiority and practicality of their approach compared to other methods. The results reflect notable improvements in classification accuracy, underscoring the real-world relevance of their findings.

4. **Clarity and Organization:** The paper is well-organized and clearly articulated, facilitating the comprehension of intricate concepts. The figures and tables used effectively support the text and clarify the proposed methodologies.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Expanded Comparison with Current Models:** While the authors compare their work with existing methods, a more extensive evaluation including additional contemporary GNN algorithms would strengthen their analysis. Furthermore, discussing the computational efficiency of their approach in comparison to the other methods analyzed could offer useful insights for practical application.

2. **Implications of Redundancy Reduction:** Although the study emphasizes reducing redundancy, it would benefit from addressing any potential trade-offs, especially regarding the complexity of the proposed methods and situations where redundancy might not result in oversquashing.

3. **Need for Additional Experiments:** Some assertions, like the expressiveness of 0-NTs, need further empirical backing. Additional investigations into various graph structures and types would lend more support to their claims of expressiveness.

4. **Clarification of Parameters:** The reasoning behind the selected parameters for k-NTs warrants further explanation. Providing clarity on the rationale for these choices would enhance the credibility of the reported results.

**Minor Points:**

- The mention of "Mckelvey et al. (2018)" seems tangential to the paper's core content and could lead to reader confusion without sufficient context.
- Additionally, greater detail regarding the experimental setup, specifically about hyperparameters and their selection criteria, would enhance reproducibility.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, this paper contributes significantly to advancing the field of graph neural networks by investigating redundancy and expressiveness. The theoretical insights are substantial, and the empirical evaluations indicate that the proposed methods could elevate the current standards of GNNs. By addressing the noted weaknesses, especially in comparative analysis and parameter justification, the paper would bolster its impact and relevance for future research.

**Rating: 7/10** (Considering its contributions and potential, a score between 7 and 8 would be appropriate if the minor issues are rectified.)
