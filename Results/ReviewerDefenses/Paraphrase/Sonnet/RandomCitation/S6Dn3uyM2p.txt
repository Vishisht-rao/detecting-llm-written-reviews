**Review of "Differentially Private One-Permutation Hashing"**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces an innovative strategy for creating differentially private hashing algorithms aimed at computing Jaccard similarity through One-Permutation Hashing (OPH). The authors propose a framework called DP-OPH that integrates differential privacy with OPH and detail three variations based on distinct densification strategies: DP-OPH-fix, DP-OPH-re, and DP-OPH-rand. They thoroughly outline the algorithm's design and privacy considerations, comparing their techniques to a baseline known as differentially private Minwise hashing (DP-MH). Empirical results from several datasets indicate that the new methods surpass the DP-MH in accurately estimating Jaccard similarity. This research seeks to address an understudied area in the literature concerning the differential privacy associated with OPH.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovation and Importance:** The work addresses a crucial challenge in privacy-preserving data analysis. Merging differential privacy with hashing methods for similarity computation is particularly timely, as concerns about data privacy continue to grow.

2. **Thorough Evaluation:** The empirical analysis is rigorous, with experiments conducted across various datasets that showcase the proposed methods' efficiency and effectiveness. The results are clearly presented, emphasizing the advantages of DP-OPH variations over the DP-MH baseline.

3. **Well-structured and Clear Presentation:** The paper is logically organized, transitioning smoothly from the introduction, background, and related research to method development and experimental findings. The technical details, algorithms, and theoretical analyses are systematically conveyed, making the content accessible to appropriately knowledgeable readers.

4. **Contributions to Theoretical and Practical Fields:** The authors not only propose new algorithms but also offer theoretical assurances (differential privacy assessments) that reinforce the credibility of their methods.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Comparison with Other Techniques:** Although the paper primarily contrasts the proposed methods with DP-MH, a broader comparison with other leading differentially private algorithms and hashing methods would strengthen the analysis. For example, referencing and contrasting with studies such as Kovacs et al. (2017) could enrich the discussion of the field.

2. **Lack of Practical Applications Discussion:** While the experiments support the proposed methods, the paper lacks a discussion on the practicality and possible limitations of applying these algorithms in real-world situations. An exploration of performance trade-offs, including computational overhead and privacy-utility dynamics, would enhance the paper's relevance.

3. **Technical Clarity:** Despite the systematic presentation of algorithms, some mathematical notations and proofs may require additional clarification. Simplifying complex equations or providing more intuitive explanations could aid in comprehension, particularly for readers who may not have a strong mathematical background.

**Conclusion:**
This paper offers a substantial contribution to the realms of differential privacy and information retrieval. The developed methods are both theoretically sound and empirically validated, representing significant progress in the estimation of private Jaccard similarity. With enhancements regarding broader comparisons and practical insights, the work has the potential to be a valuable asset for researchers and practitioners. I recommend acceptance, pending minor revisions to address the noted weaknesses.
