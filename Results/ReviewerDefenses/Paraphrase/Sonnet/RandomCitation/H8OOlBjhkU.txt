**Review of the Paper: "OPTIMIZATION OVER SPARSE SUPPORT-PRESERVING SETS VIA TWO-STEP PROJECTION"**

**Summary:**
The authors introduce a novel method for sparse optimization that incorporates strict sparsity constraints along with additional support-preserving conditions. They propose a modified iterative hard-thresholding (IHT) algorithm featuring a two-step projection operator to manage mixed constraints, overcoming the restrictions of current methods that depend on closed-form projections. Key contributions of this paper include global convergence proofs for objective values across deterministic, stochastic, and zeroth-order scenarios, as well as a fresh extension of the classic three-point lemma for non-convex mixed constraints.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach**: The introduction of the two-step projection operator is a notable advancement that facilitates the effective management of mixed constraints in sparse optimization. This technique could enhance computational efficiency and practicality in complex real-world applications.

2. **Comprehensive Convergence Guarantees**: The global convergence guarantees provided in the paper mark a significant improvement over the literature, which tends to focus on local guarantees. This enhances the theoretical robustness of the proposed algorithm.

3. **Thorough Analysis**: The authors conduct an in-depth analysis of convergence, offering rigorous proofs for their theorems. Their adaptation of the three-point lemma to non-convex scenarios is particularly impressive and highlights their commitment to optimization theory.

4. **Practical Demonstration**: The experimental results, particularly in the realm of index tracking for portfolio optimization, convincingly demonstrate the algorithm's practical usefulness. The numerical comparisons with various baseline methods effectively showcase the advantages of the proposed approach.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Assumption Complexity**: The assumptions related to restricted strong convexity and smoothness might restrict the wider applicability of the proposed method, especially in less structured optimization contexts. Clearer guidance on the conditions under which these assumptions can be relaxed would enhance the paper’s applicability.

2. **Limited Experimental Range**: Although the experimental findings are promising, they are somewhat confined to specific applications such as index tracking. Conducting additional experiments across a broader range of scenarios, including topics like signal processing or machine learning, would provide a more thorough evaluation of the algorithm’s capabilities.

3. **Contextual Literature Discussion**: The paper would benefit from a more detailed examination of how the proposed method aligns with recent developments in the area. While the authors reference pertinent literature, a deeper discussion regarding contrasting methodologies, especially in practical applications, would enrich the contextual understanding of their research.

**Minor Comments:**
- The manuscript contains minor typographical and formatting errors that should be corrected to improve clarity.
- The reference to "Monge et al. (2021)" by the authors lacks a clear explanation of its significance. A more explicit connection to this citation would enhance the narrative regarding the existing literature.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, this paper makes a substantial contribution to the sparse optimization field. The innovative two-step projection technique, combined with solid theoretical backing and empirical evidence, opens up promising research opportunities. The authors should address the identified weaknesses and broaden the experimental context to strengthen the paper's impact. I recommend accepting the paper with minor revisions.
