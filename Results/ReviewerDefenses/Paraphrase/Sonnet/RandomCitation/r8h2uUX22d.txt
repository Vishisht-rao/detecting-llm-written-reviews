**Review of "Understanding MLP-Mixer as a Wide and Sparse MLP"**

**Overall Evaluation:**

This paper offers an in-depth examination of the MLP-Mixer architecture, a novel model based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) that operates without convolutional or attention-based mechanisms. The authors suggest that the MLP-Mixer can be accurately characterized as a wide and sparse MLP, providing both theoretical insights and empirical evidence to support their assertions. The paper is logically organized and fills a significant gap in the current literature on the performance mechanisms of MLP-based architectures.

**Strengths:**

1. **Theoretical Contributions:** This study introduces original theoretical perspectives on the MLP-Mixer's structure, showcasing how it can be represented as a wide MLP with sparse weights. The proposal of the RP-Mixer as an alternative to the traditional sparse-weight MLP is a noteworthy contribution that enhances understanding of memory efficiency and computational requirements.

2. **Empirical Validation:** The authors carry out thorough experiments that back their theoretical claims. By investigating the similarities in hidden features and performance between the MLP-Mixer and various types of sparse-weight MLPs, they convincingly demonstrate that greater width and sparsity positively affect model performance.

3. **Novel Architecture Classifications:** The introduction of the Permuted-Kronecker (PK) family of architectures provides a useful framework to integrate various architectural models, improving the comprehension of efficient weight usage.

4. **Comparative Analysis:** The paper adeptly compares the MLP-Mixer and the RP-Mixer to traditional sparse-weight MLPs. These comparisons yield valuable insights into the performance trade-offs related to different widths and structures.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Exploration of Alternatives:** Although the paper highlights the benefits of the MLP-Mixer and RP-Mixer, it could be strengthened by exploring other design alternatives that might compete with these models. For instance, discussing hybrid architectures that blend convolutional and attention-based mechanisms could broaden the perspective on possible designs.

2. **Generalization of Findings:** The experiments mainly use standard datasets like CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. While these benchmarks are significant, testing the models on more complex datasets or in real-world settings could better confirm the robustness of their findings.

3. **Reproducibility Concerns:** Despite including a reproducibility statement, the paper could provide more detailed clarity on the experimental setup, particularly regarding hyperparameter tuning and initialization methods, to enhance transparency for future researchers attempting to repeat the studies.

**Minor Issues:**

- The writing is mostly clear, although a few sections would benefit from more succinct explanations to improve readability.
- Figures and tables should be properly referenced in the text to assist readers in understanding the experimental results.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, this research makes a valuable contribution to the comprehension of the MLP-Mixer from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. The results reinforce the premise that wider, sparse models can lead to better performance, in line with prior hypotheses. With some minor revisions and a deeper exploration of alternative architectures and larger-scale validations, this paper could serve as an essential reference for future studies on MLP-based architectures.

Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, contingent upon the authors addressing the identified weaknesses.
