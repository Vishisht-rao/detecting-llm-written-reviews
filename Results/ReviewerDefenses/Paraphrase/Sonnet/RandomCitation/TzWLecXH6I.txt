**Review of "Towards Personalized AI: Early-Stopping Low-Rank Adaptation of Foundation Models"**

**Summary:**
The authors introduce a new method for fine-tuning foundation models that combines low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with an innovative early stopping criterion based on the CS-Fluctuation metric. They point out that non-experts often struggle with overfitting when personalizing AI models using limited training data. To address this, CS-Fluctuation monitors changes in cosine similarity between the weights of pre-trained models and LoRA parameters, serving as an indicator for the onset of overfitting. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments on various personalized datasets in both image generation (with Latent Diffusion Models) and language tasks (using large language models).

**Strengths:**
1. **Relevance and Contribution:** The problem addressed is critical, as the demand for personalized AI solutions continues to rise. The authors’ focus on creating a method accessible to non-experts adds significant value to discussions within the AI community.

2. **Innovative Monitoring Metric:** CS-Fluctuation is a unique metric that allows for early stopping in fine-tuning without depending on traditional validation sets, which may be limited or overly subjective in personalized scenarios.

3. **Thorough Experiments:** The paper includes an extensive experimental framework with a range of datasets and tasks. The promising results indicate that models utilizing the CS-Fluctuation approach can avoid overfitting while producing high-quality outputs.

4. **Lucid Presentation:** The writing is generally clear and logically structured. The inclusion of figures to illustrate concepts, such as CS changes and identified turning points, enhances understanding.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Abstraction and Generalization:** Although the focus is on LoRA fine-tuning, a wider discussion on the applicability of CS-Fluctuation to other fine-tuning methods would strengthen the work. While there is a mention of its potential use in contexts like Dreambooth, more thorough details on its general applicability are needed.

2. **Theoretical Justification:** The paper does not sufficiently articulate the theoretical basis for why CS-Fluctuation effectively signals the onset of overfitting. An exploration of the mathematical principles underlying this metric would bolster the credibility of the approach.

3. **Computational and Practical Implications:** Since the CS-Fluctuation method involves additional computational overhead for monitoring, the paper falls short in addressing scalability and efficiency in comparison to conventional methods. It would be helpful to discuss trade-offs, especially for applications in low-resource settings.

4. **Lack of Comparisons:** While the proposed method is validated using multiple personalized datasets, there is no comparison to contemporary early stopping methodologies or fine-tuning techniques. Including such comparisons would clarify the advantages of the new method.

**Minor Points:**
- Some minor typographical errors and awkward phrases are present (e.g., “the overfitted LoRA result in generated images that are inconsistent with the prompt”), and a careful proofreading would improve the overall text quality.
- The reference to "Topping et al. (2016)" seems to lack context and relevance, potentially confusing readers as it does not align with the main themes of the paper.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, this paper provides valuable contributions to the field of personalized AI by innovatively monitoring model fine-tuning processes. By addressing the noted weaknesses, particularly related to theoretical foundations and broader applicability, the authors could significantly enhance their work. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on clarifying the theoretical underpinnings and expanding the context of their findings.
