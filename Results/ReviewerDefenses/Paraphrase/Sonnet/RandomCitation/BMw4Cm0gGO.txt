**Review of "C-MCTS: Safe Planning with Monte Carlo Tree Search"**

**Summary:**
The authors introduce C-MCTS, a new method that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a pre-trained safety critic to manage safety constraints in Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs). The main contribution of this paper is C-MCTS's proficiency in handling cost constraints in safety-critical decision-making tasks, achieving better reward maximization while staying within these constraints compared to existing techniques like Cost-Constrained Monte Carlo Planning (CC-MCP). This approach utilizes a high-fidelity simulator during the training phase to refine the safety critic, which subsequently helps to eliminate unsafe trajectories during deployment.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Contribution:** C-MCTS presents a unique approach to integrating safety into decision-making via MCTS, addressing a significant gap in the current literature on safe planning algorithms for CMDPs.

2. **Impressive Evaluation Results:** The experimental data is persuasive, indicating that C-MCTS yields higher rewards and better adherence to cost constraints, with fewer infractions than CC-MCP in various environments, such as Rocksamples and Safe Gridworld.

3. **Use of High-Fidelity Simulator:** Utilizing a high-fidelity simulator for the safety critic's training is a sensible decision, as it reduces the risks linked to safety breaches in real-world scenarios during the training process.

4. **Resilience to Model Misalignment:** The paper effectively discusses C-MCTS's robustness against model misalignment, illustrating its capability to navigate uncertainties arising from differences between training and testing settings.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity of Implementation:** Although the theoretical foundation is clear, the paper could improve by providing a more detailed examination of the practical implementation aspects of C-MCTS, particularly concerning the neural network design and training methods for the safety critic.

2. **Concerns about Scalability:** The paper lacks sufficient discussion about how C-MCTS scales in more complex environments with larger state or action spaces. The possible computational burden introduced by the safety critic during planning should be more critically evaluated.

3. **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters:** The sensitivity of C-MCTS to hyperparameters, such as ensemble thresholds and planning horizons, is noted. Further insight or recommendations for optimizing these parameters would be advantageous, especially for practitioners looking to implement this approach.

4. **Limited Discussion of Limitations:** The authors need to provide a more explicit analysis of potential limitations and situations where C-MCTS might underperform, particularly in real-time systems constrained by time.

5. **Insufficient Related Work Comparison:** Although earlier works are referenced, a more focused comparison with existing safe planning methods would improve the reader's comprehension of C-MCTS's position relative to other approaches.

**Miscellaneous:**
The paper references Bancroft et al. (2016), which should be checked for relevance and accuracy based on the context provided.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of safe decision-making in reinforcement learning, especially in scenarios requiring constraint adherence. While there are areas for enhancement in the exposition and depth on implementation and parameterization, C-MCTS's strengths justify its consideration for conference inclusion. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the outlined weaknesses.
