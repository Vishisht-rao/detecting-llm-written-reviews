**Review of the Paper: CEDNet: A Cascade Encoder-Decoder Network for Dense Prediction**

**Summary**:
The authors introduce CEDNet, an innovative architecture aimed at improving multi-scale feature extraction and fusion for dense prediction tasks, including object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. The main advancement is the cascade encoder-decoder design, which facilitates early and efficient multi-scale feature integration throughout the network stages. This method contrasts with conventional approaches that often overemphasize classification backbones, leading to delayed feature fusion and less-than-ideal performance.

**Strengths**:
1. **Original Contribution**: The cascade encoder-decoder structure presented is a significant advancement beyond traditional models reliant on classification backbones. The authors back their approach with theoretical arguments that illustrate how early feature fusion can enhance the overall effectiveness of the network.

2. **Thorough Experimental Evaluation**: The authors perform rigorous experiments on multiple benchmarks (COCO and ADE20K), demonstrating marked improvements when compared to baseline models. They include comprehensive comparisons with leading methods and various design versions, reinforcing their findings.

3. **Accessibility of Implementation**: By making their code available to the public, the authors enhance the work's value and potential impact within the research community, allowing others to build on their results and extend the application of the methods.

4. **Clear Presentation**: The paper is well-organized, with distinct sections that clearly delineate the motivation, methods, experiments, and outcomes. The figures are illustrative and aid in the reader's understanding of the proposed architecture.

**Weaknesses**:
1. **Insufficient Complexity Discussion**: While the authors highlight CEDNet's streamlined design, there is a notable lack of in-depth discussion on computational complexity and the associated trade-offs. A more detailed analysis of model efficiency, including parameter counts and FLOPs relative to other architectures, would enhance the paper. As the authors claim CEDNet achieves significant benefits with only a slight increase in complexity, a detailed explanation of this aspect would be useful.

2. **Absence of Qualitative Results**: The focus is primarily on quantitative outcomes. Including qualitative assessments or visualizations that showcase specific instances of enhanced predictions would further demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness in real-world applications.

3. **Implementation Challenges**: The claim that “CEDNet has a more streamlined and efficient structure” is made without elaborating on the implementation challenges related to the architecture. Discussing potential training and implementation complexities would provide clarity regarding the practical application of CEDNet across various tasks and datasets.

4. **Overlooking Recent Developments**: The related works section would benefit from incorporating more up-to-date architectures and advancements in dense prediction tasks, especially those from the post-2022 era. It would be pertinent to address how recent iterative refinement methods could influence their findings.

5. **Citation Issues**: While the paper references several key works, the citation of "Urias et al. (2015)" lacks a clear context or relevance for the current discourse. This citation appears misplaced and disrupts the continuity of the related works section.

**Conclusion and Recommendation**:
In summary, the paper makes a notable contribution to dense prediction tasks by introducing CEDNet, which shows promise for enhanced feature fusion capabilities. However, I recommend revising the paper to address the identified shortcomings, particularly concerning computational complexities, qualitative assessments, and better engagement with recent literature. Once these areas have been improved, CEDNet is likely to represent a substantial advancement in network designs for dense prediction applications.

**Overall Rating**: Accept pending minor revisions.
