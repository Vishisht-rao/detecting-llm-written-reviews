**Review of "DOS: Dreaming Outlier Semantics for Out-of-Distribution Detection"**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces a new technique for detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) instances, named DOS (Dreaming Outlier Semantics). This method takes advantage of large language models (LLMs) to detect potential outlier classes without needing actual OOD data. The authors put forth a framework that utilizes labels generated by LLMs and introduces a novel scoring function that considers the relationships between in-distribution and outlier classes, aiming to improve zero-shot OOD detection performance. The method is empirically tested on various OOD detection challenges, including distant, nearby, and fine-grained scenarios, demonstrating competitive or superior results compared to existing techniques.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovation**: The approach of employing LLMs to create potential outlier semantics is an inventive solution that tackles a major drawback of zero-shot OOD detection, which typically depends on closed-set identifiers.

2. **Performance**: The empirical findings reveal that the method achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple standard datasets, confirming its effectiveness in managing different OOD challenges.

3. **Scalability and Generalizability**: A significant advantage of this approach is its capacity to be applied to large datasets like ImageNet-1K and its adaptation to a variety of OOD detection tasks (distant, nearby, and fine-grained), enhancing its practical applicability.

4. **Clear Structure**: The paper is organized logically, progressing from the motivation behind the study to the methodology and empirical validation, which aids reader understanding.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Comparison with Other Methods**: Although the authors make some comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques, including additional baseline methods could provide a more thorough evaluation of their approach's effectiveness. For example, the omission of methods like "Claudio et al. (2024)" weakens the discussion regarding the advantages of DOS.

2. **Dependence on LLMs**: The framework's reliance on LLM performance for generating outlier classes means that variability in these models' outputs might impact overall OOD detection effectiveness. Including a discussion on the potential limitations or inconsistencies in LLM outputs would enhance the paper.

3. **Interpretability**: While the authors mention that the DOS clustering tends to make semantic sense, providing more visualizations and qualitative analyses of the generated outlier classes and their effects on detection results would improve the clarity of the findings.

4. **Ethical Considerations**: The authors claim there are no ethical issues associated with their research; however, a deeper exploration of the implications of using LLMs, particularly concerning training data biases and their possible effects on outlier class generation, would be beneficial.

**Conclusion:**
This paper makes a significant contribution to OOD detection by presenting a novel method that integrates the capabilities of LLMs with current vision-language models. Its strong performance across various datasets indicates that the DOS technique could enhance OOD detection in real-world contexts. Addressing the noted weaknesses—particularly regarding comparisons with other methods and the implications of relying on LLMs—could further improve the clarity and impact of the study.
