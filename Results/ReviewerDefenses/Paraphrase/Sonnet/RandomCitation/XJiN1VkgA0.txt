**Review of "Generating with Confidence: Uncertainty Quantification for Black-Box Large Language Models"**

**General Overview**
This paper offers a significant and timely exploration of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for black-box large language models (LLMs), focusing specifically on natural language generation (NLG). As LLMs are increasingly utilized across various applications, it is essential to comprehend the reliability of their outputs. The authors successfully distinguish between uncertainty and confidence and introduce several innovative measures to evaluate UQ for LLMs without needing access to the model's internal mechanisms.

**Strengths**
1. **Novelty**: The research fills a void in the existing literature concerning UQ for NLG, particularly in cases where the models are proprietary or computational resource limitations exist.
2. **Clear Definitions**: The clear differentiation between uncertainty and confidence is well-presented, which is vital for readers to understand the forthcoming methodological contributions.
3. **Methodological Rigor**: The methods introduced for UQ are robust and thoroughly assessed across diverse LLMs and question-answering datasets. The inclusion of pairwise similarity measures, like Jaccard similarity and Natural Language Inference (NLI), establishes a solid framework for evaluating output variability.
4. **Solid Experimental Design**: The comprehensive experiments conducted on well-known datasets such as CoQA, TriviaQA, and Natural Questions are praiseworthy. Using various metrics (like AUROC and AUARC) to measure the UQ techniques' effectiveness is a notable strength.

**Weaknesses**
1. **Limited Scope of Evaluation**: While the paper effectively assesses UQ in question-answering tasks, it is uncertain how well the proposed measures will extend to more open-ended and complex NLG tasks. Future research could delve into these areas to confirm the adaptability of the measures.
2. **Discussion on Limitations**: Although the authors acknowledge their work's limitations, a more in-depth exploration of potential failure modes of the proposed measures in real-world scenarios would enrich the discussion. For instance, examining the effects of selecting an unsuitable similarity measure could provide valuable insights.
3. **Reference Citations**: The paper may benefit from a more comprehensive literature review that places current UQ methodologies in the context of prior research. For example, while the paper references "Barela et al. (2019)" as a study lacking insight, it would be advantageous to detail how this work compares to the present study in terms of advancements and distinctions.

**Conclusion**
This paper significantly enhances the understanding of uncertainty in LLMs, and its methods are accessible for practitioners to apply in practical settings. However, addressing the noted limitations and elaborating on certain evaluations would provide a more comprehensive discussion of the findings and their relevance to the wider field of NLP. Overall, this research has the potential to improve the reliability of LLM outputs and will be of considerable interest to both academic and industry audiences.

**Recommendation: Accept with Minor Revisions**
The paper is well-written overall, and its findings are meaningful. Nonetheless, it would benefit from a deeper contextualization within the literature and a more thorough discussion of its limitations.
