**Review of "Rank-Adaptive Spectral Pruning of Convolutional Layers During Training"**

This paper introduces an innovative technique aimed at reducing the computational and memory demands of deep learning. It leverages a low-rank training algorithm that adaptively prunes convolutional layers during the training process. The authors tackle the limitations present in conventional low-rank factorization applied to fully connected layers by expanding this concept to convolutional layers through a Tucker decomposition method.

### Strengths

1. **Novel Methodology**: The adaptive rank-pruning strategy put forth preserves the tensor structure of convolutional layers, marking a significant enhancement compared to existing approaches that merely flatten tensors. This development fills a vital gap in the current literature concerning effective management of convolutional layers.

2. **Theoretical Insights**: The authors offer a comprehensive theoretical analysis, establishing that their algorithm successfully achieves loss reduction and closely approximates baseline performance. The use of geometric integration and the unique characteristics of the Tucker decomposition enriches the mathematical basis of the study.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: Comprehensive experiments conducted on multiple architectures and datasets substantiate the practical effectiveness of the proposed technique. Findings reveal that the Tucker Dynamical Low-Rank Training (TDLRT) surpasses both traditional low-rank factorizations and cutting-edge pruning methods, underscoring its capacity to maintain high performance while significantly lowering training expenses.

4. **Training Stability**: The research demonstrates that the proposed method ensures stable training conditions, particularly in scenarios where conventional methods may suffer from slow convergence due to ill-conditioning. This robustness is particularly advantageous for practitioners.

### Weaknesses

1. **Practical Complexity**: Although the theoretical aspects and proposed algorithms are promising, implementing these techniques in practice may introduce added complexity. The algorithm's dependence on retaining orthonormal bases and handling multiple tensor decompositions could deter its application in real-world settings when compared to simpler training methods.

2. **Limited Focus on Activation Costs**: The study primarily examines parameter and optimizer costs but overlooks the possibility of reducing activation costs during training. Investigating this area could enhance the thoroughness of the proposed approach.

3. **Assumption of Low-Rank Structures**: The success of the TDLRT method is contingent on the assumption of low-rank structures within the networks being analyzed. While there is some empirical support for this assumption, a more robust theoretical justification or additional results backing this premise could bolster the overall contributions of the study.

4. **Need for Broader Comparisons**: While the experimental findings highlight TDLRT against specific methods, providing more extensive comparisons with a wider array of contemporary techniques, especially newer ones that emerged after the paper's submission, would offer a clearer context for its relevance in the existing literature.

### Minor Comments

- The paper contains unintended references to unrelated studies, such as "Burden et al. (2015)," which should be rectified as they do not appear to be relevant to the research discussed.
- A clearer definition of the acronym "TDLRT" at its initial mention would enhance understanding and readability in relation to the study.

### Conclusion

In summary, this paper marks a notable advancement in convolutional neural networks through the introduction of rank-adaptive spectral pruning. Its solid theoretical framework and empirical validation signify a valuable contribution to both the academic field and practical applications in deep learning. However, addressing the identified weaknesses, particularly regarding complexity and the underlying assumptions, would further improve the work's impact and applicability. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, especially focusing on the suggested enhancements.
