### Review of the Paper "MMBench: Is Your Multi-Modal Model an All-Around Player?"

**Overall Assessment:**

The paper introduces MMBench, a novel benchmark aimed at assessing vision-language models (VLMs). The authors proficiently pinpoint the shortcomings of current benchmarks, especially regarding their robustness and evaluation metrics' detail. They propose a structured evaluation system, featuring a carefully assembled dataset and a new evaluation approach called CircularEval, making a valuable contribution to the field. Additionally, leveraging ChatGPT for extracting choices from model outputs is an innovative and timely strategy in light of the recent developments in large language models.

**Strengths:**

1. **Understanding Challenges:**
The authors effectively outline the existing difficulties in evaluating large VLMs, such as the limitations of traditional benchmarks, which often lead to false negatives due to strict matching criteria and biases in subjective assessments. This lays a solid groundwork for the need for a new benchmarking approach.

2. **Strong Evaluation Method:**
The CircularEval method, which systematically alters answer choices and demands consistent performance across various evaluations, strengthens the evaluation process. This thoughtful approach helps reduce the likelihood of benefiting from random guessing.

3. **Dataset Development:**
MMBench features a dataset of 2,948 well-crafted questions across 20 distinct ability dimensions, offering a broad scope for evaluation. The authors provide adequate information about the question creation process and the hierarchical taxonomy that supports the ability dimensions.

4. **ChatGPT Utilization:**
Using ChatGPT to extract choices from free-form model outputs is a creative method. The high alignment rate (87%) between ChatGPT and human reviewers suggests this could lead to more uniform evaluations compared to conventional techniques.

5. **Thorough Results:**
The in-depth evaluation of several prominent VLMs against the new benchmark delivers valuable insights and reveals the strengths and weaknesses of different models.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Challenges of Human Evaluation Scaling:**
While the paper acknowledges the constraints of human involvement in evaluations, it does not thoroughly address the potential scalability issues. The continued need for human input in initial evaluations presents a bottleneck for large-scale implementation of MMBench.

2. **Generalization Outside Benchmarks:**
The paper seems to assume that better performance on MMBench will lead to improvements in real-world applications, but it does not fully explore the relationship between benchmark results and real-world relevance.

3. **Deficiencies in Error Analysis:**
Although the models' performance is evaluated, the paper would benefit from a more comprehensive error analysis that illustrates common mistakes made by VLMs in CircularEval versus VanillaEval. Providing qualitative examples would enhance the findings.

4. **Comparison with State-of-the-Art:**
Although various VLMs are compared, a more detailed comparison with the latest benchmarks, such as MME (Fu et al., 2023), and competing frameworks would bolster the authors’ assertions about MMBench’s advantages.

**Additional Comments:**

The paper is generally well-structured with a coherent flow from the abstract to the conclusion. However, minor grammatical errors detract from its overall presentation, and careful proofreading is advised. The references are mostly well-cited, but the attribution of "Lusk et al. (2022)" lacks context within the text.

**Conclusion:**

In summary, this paper presents a promising new benchmark for evaluating vision-language models that effectively addresses significant existing challenges. The proposed methods, particularly CircularEval and the incorporation of ChatGPT, signify notable progress in the field. Future research could focus on minimizing the reliance on human evaluations, conducting a more detailed error analysis, and clarifying the connections between benchmark performance and real-world applicability. I recommend accepting this paper, keeping in mind the suggested areas for improvement.
