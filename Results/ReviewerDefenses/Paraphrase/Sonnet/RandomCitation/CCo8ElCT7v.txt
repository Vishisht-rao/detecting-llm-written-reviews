### Review of "COMPREHENSIVE COMPARISON BETWEEN VISION TRANSFORMERS AND CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS FOR FACE RECOGNITION TASKS"

#### Summary
The manuscript evaluates and compares Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in face recognition tasks, particularly in identification and verification. The study analyzes six leading models: EfficientNet, Inception, MobileNet, ResNet, VGG, and ViTs, utilizing five distinct datasets to assess various challenges in face recognition, including issues like occlusions and changes in distance. The findings indicate that ViTs excel over CNNs in terms of accuracy, robustness, memory utilization, and inference speed, positioning them as a promising alternative for face recognition applications.

#### Strengths
1. **Well-Defined Contribution**: The paper effectively states its objective of contrasting ViTs and CNNs specifically within the realm of face recognition, which addresses a critical gap in the existing literature that has largely concentrated on broad image classification.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: By employing multiple datasets, the study offers a well-rounded perspective on the performance of different models under varied circumstances, enhancing the reliability of its results.

3. **Robust Experimental Design**: The authors meticulously describe their experimental procedures, including hardware and hyperparameter settings, promoting reproducibility. The consistent use of hyperparameters across the models ensures a fair assessment.

4. **Insights on Model Performance**: The results are presented systematically, with well-defined metrics for identification and verification tasks. The inclusion of ROC curves, AUC, and EER contributes to a deeper understanding of each model's performance traits.

5. **Memory Efficiency and Inference Time Analysis**: The focus on memory usage and inference time is crucial, especially for real-world applications with limited computational resources, significantly contributing to practical deployment considerations.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Literature Review Depth**: Although the paper references relevant studies, particularly those related to ViTs and CNNs in generic image classification, a more detailed literature review tailored specifically to face recognition applications would enhance the context for the findings. Insights from studies comparing these models in other domains could further enrich the analysis.

2. **Limited Analysis of Exceptions**: The manuscript identifies a few instances where CNNs performed well, such as VGG surpassing ViT in certain masked face scenarios, but this observation lacks a deeper exploration. A thorough analysis of the specific conditions under which CNNs excel could yield important insights into the complementary benefits of the two architectures.

3. **Potential Overlook of Architectural Variants**: The focus is primarily on standard architectures for ViTs and CNNs. It would be advantageous to explore recent modifications or variations of these architectures that might affect performance metrics. Moreover, discussing the limitations of the examined architectures in relation to face recognition tasks could enhance the depth of the paper.

4. **Minor Typographical Errors**: The text contains typographical errors that impede clarity. For instance, some sentence structures could be refined for improved readability.

5. **Unaddressed Citations**: The paper references several pertinent studies but includes a mention of "Howell et al. (2022)" without elaboration or contextual relevance, raising questions about its significance and the accuracy of its citation.

#### Conclusion
In summary, the paper makes important contributions to the field of face recognition by offering a detailed and systematic comparison of Vision Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks. While it demonstrates notable strengths in experimental design and result presentation, there are areas that could benefit from refinement, particularly in the thoroughness of the literature review and the analysis of exceptions. With the recommended revisions, this work has the potential to be a valuable asset for researchers seeking to comprehend the comparative advantages of various neural network architectures in face recognition tasks.
