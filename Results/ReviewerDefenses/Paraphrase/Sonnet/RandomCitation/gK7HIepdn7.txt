**Review of "MATLABER: MATERIAL-AWARE TEXT-TO-3D VIA LATENT BRDF AUTO-ENCODER"**

**Summary:**
The authors introduce MATLABER, a novel solution for text-to-3D generation that utilizes a latent BRDF auto-encoder to improve the quality of materials in 3D assets created from text descriptions. This work tackles the shortcomings of current models that find it challenging to recover high-fidelity materials, especially in distinguishing materials under varying lighting conditions. Through a training approach based on large BRDF datasets and a technique for semantic-aware material regularization, MATLABER seeks to generate materials that are both more realistic and adjustable for subsequent tasks such as relighting and material manipulation.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Methodology:** The incorporation of a latent BRDF auto-encoder is a noteworthy advancement in the field, offering a data-driven foundation that improves the realism of generated materials. This method may also have implications beyond text-to-3D applications, potentially benefiting other rendering processes.

2. **Extensive Experimental Evaluation:** The authors conduct a comprehensive set of experiments, benchmarking their approach against leading methods like DreamFusion and Fantasia3D. The addition of user studies to assess factors such as alignment, realism, detail, and disentanglement provides persuasive support for the effectiveness of their method.

3. **Practical Application:** The capability to separate materials from environmental lighting and facilitate relighting and material editing offers valuable applications in industries such as gaming, film, and augmented/virtual reality. These functionalities highlight the relevance of this work in the fast-paced field of content creation.

4. **Organized Presentation:** The paper is structured clearly, with well-defined technical terms and a coherent progression of ideas. The use of figures and tables effectively demonstrates the results and comparisons with existing methodologies.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Dataset Constraints:** Although the authors utilize large BRDF datasets, certain biases inherent in these datasets, particularly the absence of metallic materials in the TwoShotBRDF set, may limit the generalizability of the representations learned. This limitation should be discussed more explicitly.

2. **Absence of Quantitative Metrics:** While qualitative comparisons showcase enhancements, the paper would benefit from a quantitative assessment that specifies metrics for the generated BRDF materials under diverse lighting scenarios.

3. **Method Complexity:** Despite the innovation of the proposed approach, its complexity might pose challenges for practitioners aiming to implement it. A more thorough guide on how to practically apply MATLABER and integrate it into existing workflows would improve accessibility.

4. **Contextualization in Literature:** It would be advantageous for the authors to place their research within the context of the wider literature on material estimation and generative models. Specifically, they should address significant contributions in this area since Langlois et al. (2020) that are currently overlooked.

**Overall Impression:**
The paper marks a meaningful progress in the realm of text-to-3D generation, tackling key challenges related to material representation. The results are encouraging, and the proposed method seems robust, though further validation with a broader range of datasets and more comprehensive implementation guidance could enhance its significance. Overall, MATLABER is a significant addition to the field, representing a commendable contribution to the literature. 

**Recommendation:** Accept with minor revisions.
