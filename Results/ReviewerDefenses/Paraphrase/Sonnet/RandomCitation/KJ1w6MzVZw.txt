**Review of "LARGE PRE-TRAINED TIME SERIES MODELS FOR CROSS-DOMAIN TIME SERIES ANALYSIS TASKS"**

**Summary:**
This paper introduces an innovative approach for analyzing time-series data through the development of Large Pre-trained Time-series Models (LPTM), which utilize self-supervised learning (SSL) for creating a versatile model capable of adaptation across various distinct domains. The authors contend that conventional time-series models often necessitate extensive domain-specific training, which is inefficient in terms of data usage and could hinder overall performance. Their method incorporates adaptive segmentation techniques for pre-training on multiple datasets, aiming to enrich the model's inputs semantically while optimizing data and computational resource efficiency.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Methodology**: The use of self-supervised learning and a specialized segmentation module for different domains represents a noteworthy advancement in time-series analysis, allowing for improved adaptation to the unique features of diverse time-series datasets.

2. **Impressive Performance Metrics**: The experimental findings indicate that LPTM achieves leading performance in numerous forecasting and classification tasks while utilizing less training data and time. This is crucial for real-world scenarios where data availability can be limited.

3. **Thorough Evaluation**: The authors conduct extensive evaluations across a variety of datasets and benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of their model in multiple tasks and domains. They highlight that LPTM not only excels in performance but also operates with significantly reduced data and training periods compared to existing models.

4. **Well-Defined Methodology**: The methodology section is organized effectively, presenting a clear structure for both the segmentation approach and the SSL tasks utilized during pre-training, facilitating understanding and potential replication of their work by readers.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Implementation Complexity**: Although the paper articulates its technical contributions effectively, the implementation details regarding the segmentation and scoring mechanisms need further elaboration to assist practitioners in executing the model without confusion.

2. **Limited Baseline Comparisons**: While the paper compares LPTM to several existing models, there is an opportunity to expand the comparison to include additional contemporary models that claim advancements in time-series forecasting.

3. **Discussion of Practical Applications**: Although the paper touches on the benefits of reduced data requirements, a deeper exploration of practical implications and potential applications in industry or academia would enhance its relevance. For instance, insights into the model's performance in complex settings like stock market predictions or healthcare analytics would be beneficial.

4. **Consideration of Ethical Issues**: The authors acknowledge the importance of addressing ethical implications and the potential misuse of their model in critical areas such as public health. However, specific strategies or frameworks to tackle these issues in future research are lacking.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, this paper contributes significantly to the field of time-series analysis with its promising framework of LPTM that employs multi-domain pre-training and adaptive segmentation. This approach facilitates the development of more generalizable models capable of learning from a variety of datasets, which is a challenging aspect of the field. While there are areas needing improvement—particularly concerning practical applications and ethical considerations—the strengths of the paper position it well for further consideration and dialogue at the conference.

**Recommendation:**
I suggest acceptance of this paper with minor revisions, mainly focusing on improving the clarity of the methodology and expanding the discussion around practical applications and ethical issues.

**Citation Error Note:**
The authors should verify the accuracy of their references, including mentions of Quach et al. (2016), which does not seem relevant to the discussed topic. This issue should be addressed to maintain the research's integrity.
