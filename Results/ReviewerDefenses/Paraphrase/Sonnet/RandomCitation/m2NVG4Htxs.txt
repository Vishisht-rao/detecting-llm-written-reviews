**Review of the Paper "TO THE CUTOFF ...AND BEYOND? A LONGITUDINAL PERSPECTIVE ON LLM DATA CONTAMINATION"**

### Summary

This paper provides an in-depth and original longitudinal examination of data contamination and memorization in large language models (LLMs), specifically analyzing how cutoff dates during training impact outcomes. Utilizing datasets from competitive programming sites, such as Codeforces and Project Euler, the authors quantitatively explore the connection between model performance and the presence of problems on GitHub, differentiating performances before and after the cutoff. Their results indicate a statistically significant positive correlation between performance and GitHub presence for problems released prior to the cutoff, which diminishes afterward, indicating evidence of contamination.

### Strengths

1. **Innovative Approach**: The authors apply a longitudinal method that is relatively uncommon in the study of data contamination in LLMs. This strategy, influenced by experimental economics, effectively segments datasets based on the training cutoff date, providing a strong framework for future related research.

2. **Thorough Dataset Selection**: The choice of datasets from Codeforces and Project Euler is apt, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of LLM capabilities in code generation and problem solving over time. The openness of the datasets and evaluation methods further improves the reproducibility and accessibility of their work.

3. **Detailed Statistical Examination**: The paper features extensive statistical assessments using regression models to analyze multiple independent and dependent variables. The clarity in reporting confidence intervals, odds ratios, and thorough regression diagnostics adds to the reliability of the findings.

4. **Significant Contributions**: The insights presented in the paper highlight the limitations of static benchmarks in the context of advancing AI models. Their suggestions for creating dynamic benchmarks and evaluation methods could greatly influence future LLM research and assessment approaches.

### Weaknesses

1. **Narrow Benchmark Scope**: The focus on just two specific datasets limits the broader implications of the findings. Including a wider variety of benchmarks from different domains or tasks could yield a more comprehensive understanding of contamination issues in various AI applications.

2. **Exploration of Results' Implications**: Although the paper touches on the implications regarding LLM evaluation and the need for dynamic benchmarks, it could delve deeper into how data contamination affects real-world applications. Addressing these risks would be beneficial for guiding researchers in avoiding problems when deploying LLMs.

3. **Comparison with Related Work**: While the paper references several recent studies on contamination and memorization in LLMs, it would benefit from a clearer contrast of its findings with these works, such as those by Gann et al. (2020). This would help position this research within the broader academic dialogue.

### Conclusion

In summary, this paper makes a noteworthy contribution to AI and machine learning fields by systematically tackling the significant issue of data contamination in LLMs. The authorsâ€™ innovative approach and detailed analyses support their findings, offering valuable insights into the performance of large language models. With some minor enhancements in scope and elaboration on its contextual relevance to existing literature, this paper could become a key reference for future studies in this area. I recommend acceptance to the conference, with suggestions for revisions to address the identified weaknesses.
