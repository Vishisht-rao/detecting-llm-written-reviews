**Review of "Symmetric Replay Training: Enhancing Sample Efficiency in Deep Reinforcement Learning for Combinatorial Optimization"**

**Summary:**
This paper introduces a new approach called "symmetric replay training" (SRT) aimed at enhancing sample efficiency in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques for combinatorial optimization (CO) issues. The authors highlight that CO problems, which are common in various sectors, pose significant challenges due to their extensive solution spaces and the high computational costs associated with reward assessments. By utilizing the symmetric properties of action trajectories, the SRT framework enables efficient exploration of promising regions in the action space without the need for additional reward evaluations.

The authors share experimental results from both synthetic benchmarks, like the traveling salesman problem (TSP), and real-world applications in areas such as hardware design and molecular optimization. The results indicate that SRT consistently surpasses traditional DRL methods in terms of sample efficiency.

**Strengths:**
1. **Relevance and Innovation:** The issue tackled is crucial within optimization and DRL fields, especially with the increasing demand for efficient algorithms in sectors like drug discovery and hardware design. The introduction of SRT is an innovative contribution that leverages the inherent symmetries of the CO problem space.

2. **Empirical Support:** The paper provides extensive empirical evidence showcasing the effectiveness of SRT across diverse benchmarks. The results demonstrate consistent improvements in sample efficiency and effectiveness for strategies including A2C, PPO, GFlowNet, among others, which enhances the proposed method's credibility and suggests it has practical applications.

3. **Well-Organized and Clear:** The manuscript is organized in a coherent manner, allowing readers to easily follow the authorsâ€™ reasoning. The methodology is clearly articulated, and supportive figures effectively clarify complex ideas.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Theoretical Exploration:** While the methodology is validated through empirical means, the paper lacks a comprehensive theoretical analysis of SRT. A more thorough examination of its convergence characteristics and potential drawbacks would strengthen the paper's contributions.

2. **Generalizability of Findings:** Although significant improvements are shown across various methods and problems, the extent to which these findings apply to all possible CO problems is uncertain. The authors should address scenarios where SRT might not perform as well.

3. **Comparison with Other Baselines:** While comparisons with state-of-the-art methods are included, the paper could benefit from a comparative analysis of other recent techniques targeting sample efficiency in DRL for CO, particularly in the realm of black-box optimization.

4. **Minor Technical Flaws:** There are several minor typographical errors present in the manuscript that need correction prior to publication. Additionally, some citations, such as "Huntsman et al. (2019)," appear to be inaccurately referenced and do not fit the context in which they are mentioned.

**Conclusion:**
The paper marks a notable advancement in applying deep reinforcement learning to combinatorial optimization through the introduction of symmetric replay training. Despite certain shortcomings in theoretical analysis and general applicability, the empirical findings establish a solid basis for further investigation into SRT and its potential impacts. Overall, it is a significant contribution to the field and is recommended for acceptance, pending minor revisions.
