**Review of "Entropy Coding of Unordered Data Structures"**

**Overview:**
The paper presents "shuffle coding," an innovative technique designed for optimal lossless compression of sequences composed of unordered elements, utilizing bits-back coding methods. The authors assert that shuffle coding is versatile and can be utilized for various unordered data types, including multisets, graphs, and hypergraphs. This method seeks to minimize redundancy stemming from the ordered nature of data storage, and the authors conduct a thorough evaluation of its performance across different datasets, especially regarding graph structures like molecular data.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach:** Shuffle coding is a novel and timely contribution that fills a significant gap in the entropy coding literature by providing a general method for compressing unordered data.

2. **In-Depth Background:** The authors offer a well-rounded overview of ordered versus unordered data structures, and their theoretical approach is robust, rooted in combinatorial species and group theory.

3. **Robust Experimental Evidence:** The paper features extensive experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of shuffle coding on various datasets, showing favorable results compared to existing methods. Notably, the significant reduction in message length for different graph datasets, especially molecular structures, highlights its practical utility.

4. **Open-source Resources:** The authors have made their implementation publicly available, facilitating future research and adaptations, which enhances the paper's value to the academic community.

5. **Clear Organization and Presentation:** The paper is generally well-structured and clearly written, with a coherent flow from the introduction through to the experimental results.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity and Computational Challenges:** The paper notes the computational difficulties involved in determining canonical orderings and automorphism groups in graphs. While this limitation is acknowledged, providing a more detailed discussion of potential strategies for simplifying or optimizing these processes would improve the practical aspects of the method.

2. **Initial Bit Overhead:** The challenge posed by the initial bits and the necessity for sequences to achieve the optimal rate is notable. Although the authors suggest potential improvements, addressing this concern directly within their current framework would be advantageous.

3. **Limited Comparative Analysis with Current Techniques:** While the paper includes comparisons to established methods like SZIP and PnC, a deeper analysis of how shuffle coding compares to more contemporary state-of-the-art techniques (beyond those mentioned) could further strengthen the discussion. For example, referencing work by Lark et al. (2021) could provide valuable context regarding competing methodologies.

4. **Narrow Focus on Graph Data:** The predominant emphasis on graph datasets, particularly molecular data, may restrict the general applicability of the findings. The authors could enhance their discussion by exploring the potential uses of shuffle coding in other types of unordered structures that are not graph-based.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, "Entropy Coding of Unordered Data Structures" offers a valuable contribution to the data compression field by introducing an effective new method for working with unordered objects. While some challenges remain, particularly related to computational efficiency and practical use, the paper lays a solid foundation for further exploration and development in this domain. The open-source provision of the implementation is especially praiseworthy, promising to encourage ongoing investigation into this compelling area of study.
