**Review of the Paper 'VTruST: Controllable Value Function Based Subset Selection for Data-Centric Trustworthy AI'**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces VTruST, a new methodology that merges Data-Centric AI (DCAI) principles with a focus on establishing trustworthy AI through a controllable framework for data evaluation and subset selection. The authors emphasize the significance of various trustworthiness metrics, including fairness, robustness, and explainability, and propose an online value-function-based algorithm for selecting training data subsets. Empirical findings indicate that VTruST surpasses existing state-of-the-art benchmarks regarding fairness and robustness across several datasets, while effectively balancing different trustworthiness metrics.

**Strengths:**
1. **Relevance and Originality:** The authors tackle an urgent and vital issue in AI—ensuring trustworthiness—by developing a comprehensive framework that facilitates the selection of datasets based on multiple metrics. The innovative integration of data-centric methods with trustworthiness metrics is particularly praiseworthy.

2. **Methodological Soundness:** The approach's formulation as an online sparse approximation alongside the introduction of a novel online Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm is well-grounded. The theoretical underpinnings for optimal data selection lend additional depth and credibility to the methodology.

3. **Thorough Evaluation:** The empirical assessment conducted on various datasets (such as COMPAS, CIFAR-10, etc.) using established performance metrics showcases the flexibility and efficacy of VTruST, especially in generating fairer, robust models.

4. **Metric Balancing Capability:** The paper's demonstration of balancing several trustworthiness metrics constitutes a noteworthy contribution, addressing a common challenge in fostering fairness and robustness in AI systems.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Clarity and Structure:** Although the paper conveys complex concepts, certain sections would benefit from improved clarity. For instance, the transition from theoretical concepts to practical applications is occasionally unclear. Including more illustrative examples would help enhance comprehension.

2. **Expanded Data-Centric Explanations:** The authors touch upon data-centric explanations, but this aspect could be elaborated. A more in-depth discussion of how these explanations are created and their implications would add value to the paper.

3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The paper does not adequately discuss the sensitivity of the proposed approach with respect to hyperparameters, particularly the user-defined weight parameters (λ). An analysis of how variations in these parameters impact model performance would be beneficial.

4. **Broader Baseline Comparisons:** Strengthening the argument by incorporating a wider range of baseline comparisons, especially those specifically aimed at fairness and robustness as opposed to general subset selection techniques, would enhance the paper’s rigor.

**Minor Comments:**
- The citation of "Bickel et al. (2024)" appears to be erroneous or fabricated; it is crucial to ensure the accuracy and validity of all citations and references.
- The notation used in the equations could be better articulated, as some readers may struggle to follow the mathematical expressions without clearer definitions for all terms involved.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, the paper provides a meaningful contribution to the field of trustworthy AI with its innovative VTruST framework. It adeptly addresses the critical challenges of ensuring AI fairness, robustness, and explainability in a data-centric context. Despite some clarity and methodological issues, the rigorous nature of the approach and encouraging empirical results suggest it deserves acceptance, potentially after minor revisions to enhance overall clarity and impact.
