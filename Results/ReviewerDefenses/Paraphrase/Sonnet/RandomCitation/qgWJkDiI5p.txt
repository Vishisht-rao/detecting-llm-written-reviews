**Review of "Fast Equilibrium of SGD in Generic Situations"**

**Summary:**
The work by Li et al. explores the fast equilibrium conjecture in relation to stochastic gradient descent (SGD) utilized in normalized neural networks. Building upon prior studies that confirmed the conjecture under specific conditions, the authors seek to provide a broader proof by eliminating non-generic constraints while ensuring a rigorous approach in their analysis.

**Strengths:**

1. **Relevance and Importance**: The investigation into rapid mixing times in SGD is extremely pertinent to contemporary machine learning research, particularly since normalization layers are prevalent in deep learning architectures. The results of this study hold practical significance for optimization strategies and convergence rates.

2. **Technical Advancement**: The authors effectively discard several limiting assumptions found in earlier studies. Their findings enhance the understanding of SGD behavior in more generic contexts, expanding the applicability of past results and offering a more detailed insight into the training dynamics of normalized networks.

3. **Methodological Rigor**: Utilizing a probabilistic framework and the large deviation principle, the paper presents strong conclusions regarding the convergence of SGD trajectories. The technical arguments are generally well-organized, and the mathematical explanations are comprehensive.

4. **Experimental Evidence**: The inclusion of experiments demonstrating mixing phenomena on local manifolds, along with the potential limitations of stochastic weight averaging (SWAP), provides empirical backing for the theoretical assertions. These findings amplify the argument and underscore the practical relevance of the theoretical outcomes.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Clarity and Approachability**: While the paper boasts substantial mathematical depth, certain areas may benefit from clearer explanations or simplifications. The intricate notation and sophisticated results might challenge less experienced readers or those unfamiliar with the topic.

2. **Insufficient Discussion on Implications**: Though the results are solid, the paper could delve deeper into the wider implications of lifting the restrictive assumptions. A discussion on potential applications or constraints of the findings would enrich the reader's comprehension of the work's relevance.

3. **References and Contextualization**: There is a noticeable gap in current citations related to past works, especially the exclusion of key papers such as "Almazan et al. (2017)," which address significant aspects of SGD optimization and neural network training. A more thorough literature review would enhance the contextual understanding of this study's contributions.

**Conclusion:**
This paper represents a meaningful addition to the optimization landscape in deep learning by offering a generalized proof of the fast equilibrium conjecture and deepening our understanding of SGD dynamics. Although it presents some complexity, the findings carry considerable implications for both theoretical studies and practical implementations in neural network training. Addressing the concerns mentioned could further improve its clarity and significance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
