### Review of the Paper "SAS: Structured Activation Sparsification"

#### Overview
The paper introduces a new method called Structured Activation Sparsification (SAS), which aims to enhance the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) while keeping the computational demands low. By utilizing structured sparsity in activation maps, this approach retains a limited set of non-zero activations within contiguous regions. This leads to an efficient matrix multiplication process that can be effectively run on current hardware, especially using NVIDIA's SparseTensorCore architecture. The authors present substantial empirical results indicating that their method improves accuracy on well-known datasets like CIFAR-10, while maintaining computational costs similar to those of dense networks and surpassing alternative techniques, specifically structured weight sparsification (SWS).

#### Advantages
1. **Innovative Approach**: The application of structured sparsity to activations is relatively underexplored, and the authors successfully establish SAS as a distinct strategy compared to traditional weight sparsification methods.
2. **Clear Implementation**: The mechanism for generating structured sparse activations is clearly explained, with the authors providing a solid framework for real-world application, particularly with regard to compatibility with NVIDIA's SparseTensorCore.
3. **Thorough Experimental Validation**: The experimental data convincingly show that greater sparsity achieved through SAS consistently leads to improved accuracy across various configurations and datasets. The results are well-supported and clearly presented.
4. **Relevance for Edge Computing**: The focus on resource-limited edge devices is timely and pertinent, especially as it addresses the need to lower operational costs without compromising performance.

#### Limitations
1. **Implementation Complexity**: Despite the clear presentation, the sophisticated nature of the SAS technique may make implementation challenging, particularly for those practitioners who are less familiar with structured activation methods.
2. **Insufficient Theoretical Framework**: Although the authors extensively cover empirical results, a more robust theoretical foundation could improve the understanding of why SAS achieves significant accuracy enhancements without added computational expense.
3. **Limited Comparative Analysis**: While the paper makes comparisons to methods like SWS, incorporating additional benchmarks against other recent sparsity techniques, such as those by Soukup et al. (2015), would offer a broader perspective on SAS's position within the field of model complexity reduction.
4. **Potential for Increased Memory Usage**: The authors point out that higher sparsity levels with SAS could lead to greater memory demands for weight storage, which may pose challenges for deploying these models in highly constrained environments.

#### Conclusion
The authors have significantly contributed to efficient deep learning by proposing Structured Activation Sparsification as a way to utilize sparsity in activations to improve model accuracy without escalating computational costs. The results are encouraging, though the paper could benefit from addressing practical implementation concerns and providing a stronger theoretical basis. Overall, this research holds valuable potential for enhancing the efficiency and performance of DNNs, especially in settings with limited computational resources.

#### Recommendation
I suggest accepting the paper with minor revisions, particularly to enhance the discussion of its theoretical foundations and to expand the comparative analysis to include a more extensive range of sparsity optimization techniques, including references like "Soukup et al. (2015)" for a more comprehensive exploration.
