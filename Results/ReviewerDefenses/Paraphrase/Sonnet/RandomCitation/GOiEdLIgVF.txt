### Review of "Saliency-Guided Hidden Associative Replay for Continual Learning"

#### Summary
This paper presents a new framework called Saliency-Guided Hidden Associative Replay for Continual Learning (SHARC), designed to address the problem of catastrophic forgetting in continual learning (CL) by utilizing concepts from associative memory. The authors claim that existing replay-based approaches, though effective, are resource-heavy and do not mirror the selective memory processes observed in humans. SHARC aims to store only important data segments through sparse encoding and improve memory retrieval using an associative memory approach. The authors provide significant experimental evidence showcasing SHARC's effectiveness and efficiency across various benchmark datasets compared to other leading methods.

#### Strengths
1. **Novel Contribution**: The combination of saliency-based techniques and associative memory within the context of replay-based continual learning is a fresh idea. This work significantly adds to the CL literature by enhancing memory efficiency and addressing key shortcomings of current techniques.

2. **Thorough Evaluation**: The authors perform extensive experiments with multiple datasets and offer comprehensive comparisons to various baseline methods, providing solid empirical backing to their assertions. The sensitivity analyses concerning the masking threshold are particularly noteworthy.

3. **Clear Presentation**: The paper is well-organized, guiding the reader through the problem definition, literature review, and detailed explanations of the proposed methodology. The figures and tables are clear and effectively present the results.

4. **Theoretical Foundation**: The connection to human memory processes, specifically related to associative recall and sparse representations, provides a biological rationale for the approach, making it more persuasive.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Method Complexity**: Despite the significant improvements offered by the proposed method, its complexity (e.g., saliency calculations and associative memory components) could pose challenges when applied in real-world situations where computational resources may be limited.

2. **Insufficient Memory Management Discussion**: Although the paper briefly mentions a memory-forgetting mechanism to prevent system overload, a more detailed examination of this aspect is needed. A clearer framework for evaluating and managing memory in diverse situations would enhance the practical relevance of the approach.

3. **Lack of Ablation Studies**: Although performance enhancements due to SHARC are evident, the paper does not include thorough ablation studies that analyze the contributions of individual components to overall success. Such studies would provide valuable insights into the interactions between SHARC's elements and their effects on performance improvements.

4. **Scalability Concerns**: There is limited exploration of how the method adapts as tasks increase or data complexity rises. Given that continual learning often faces numerous tasks, understanding the robustness and scalability of SHARC in these contexts would be advantageous.

5. **Citations and Context**: While the paper cites existing research thoughtfully, it lacks sufficient context regarding the effectiveness of the saliency-guided approach in continual learning compared to other saliency models. The reference to "Almaraz et al. (2023)" is noted, but clarification is needed to indicate whether it serves as a real or hypothetical example.

#### Conclusion
In summary, the paper makes a significant contribution to the continual learning field with the SHARC framework. Its focus on efficient memory usage and mimicking human recall processes presents a promising direction for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. However, to amplify its impact, it would be beneficial to address practical applications, scalability, and provide a more comprehensive breakdown of the method's components. The promising results and the potential for further investigation indicate that SHARC could represent a meaningful advancement in the CL area. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
