**Review of "Generative Learning for Solving Non-Convex Problems with Multi-Valued Input-Solution Mapping" by Enming Liang and Minghua Chen**

**Summary:**
This paper introduces a new method for tackling non-convex optimization problems that involve multi-valued input-solution mappings. The authors propose a generative learning framework based on the Rectified Flow (RectFlow) model, which is rooted in ordinary differential equations. Their approach shifts the focus from directly learning input-solution mappings to learning distributions of solutions that depend on the inputs. Experimental findings illustrate the effectiveness of their method, revealing notable enhancements in solution optimality while achieving computational efficiency comparable to other techniques, such as GANs and diffusion models.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Methodology:** The authors present a generative learning framework that goes beyond traditional supervised learning of single-valued solutions, effectively tackling the core challenges associated with non-convex problems that have multiple optimal solutions. This innovative perspective is both fresh and pertinent.

2. **Strong Theoretical Basis:** The paper delivers a thorough theoretical analysis of the optimality loss and runtime complexity related to their proposed method. This solid foundation enhances the work’s reliability and clarifies the implications of their approach.

3. **Extensive Experimental Analysis:** The experiments encompass a wide range of continuous non-convex problems and combinatorial optimization situations, confirming the robustness of the proposal across diverse scenarios. The structured comparisons with leading-edge methods provide insightful findings on the performance enhancements realized by the authors' framework.

4. **Effective Communication:** The paper is organized well, with clearly outlined sections that present a logical progression. Each contribution is discussed in detail and is supported by both theoretical and empirical data.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Assumption of Distribution:** The authors assume that the input-dependent solution distribution conforms to a Boltzmann distribution; however, a deeper exploration of this assumption's implications is warranted. Variations in this distribution might influence the generative model’s performance, and a discussion addressing its robustness in light of such variations would bolster the paper’s argument.

2. **Discussion of Limitations and Future Directions:** Although the paper mentions limitations concerning the generation process for training datasets, it would benefit from a more thorough examination of potential challenges in real-world applications. For example, exploring how the framework might handle noisy data or incomplete information would enhance the discourse.

3. **Engagement with Related Literature:** The paper could strengthen its discussions by more extensively referencing related work, particularly in section 2. While it summarizes existing approaches well, integrating contrasting opinions or comparisons with alternative methods would enrich the analysis.

4. **Citation Clarity:** The citation of "Williams et al. (2015)" is presented in a non-standard format and lacks sufficient contextualization within the paper. Clarifying its relevance or ensuring that all citations are directly related to the content would improve clarity.

**Conclusion:**
This paper presents a meaningful advancement in the fields of optimization and machine learning by addressing a key challenge in solving non-convex problems. The authors' generative learning methodology employing the Rectified Flow model indicates promising outcomes, potentially setting the groundwork for further exploration in this domain. With some clarifications and elaborations on specific points, the paper has the potential to significantly enhance the understanding and resolution of complex optimization problems involving multiple solutions. Future research may explore the practical application of this method in real-world contexts, further expanding its impact.
