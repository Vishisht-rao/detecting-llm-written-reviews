### Review of "Mixup Your Own Pairs: Supervised Contrastive Learning for Regression with Mixup"

#### Summary

The paper introduces a new methodology called Supervised Contrastive Learning for Regression with Mixup (SupReMix) aimed at enhancing representation learning in regression tasks. It focuses on two previously overlooked aspects: the consideration of ordinality and the generation of hard pairs. By employing mixup techniques, the method creates challenging positive and negative samples tailored for regression, moving beyond just utilizing real-world samples. The authors claim that in extensive testing across six different regression datasets, SupReMix consistently surpasses existing baseline methods, including standard deep regression and various contrastive learning approaches.

#### Strengths

1. **Innovative Methodology**: The strategy of generating hard positive and negative pairs through mixup at the embedding level represents a noteworthy advancement in regression representation learning. The authors effectively justify this innovation and clearly explain the advantages of leveraging ordinal information in regression tasks.

2. **Strong Theoretical Basis**: The paper includes a thorough theoretical analysis that backs the proposed methodology. The derivations related to the distance magnifying property and discussions on ordinality awareness effectively support the claims about the efficacy of SupReMix.

3. **Extensive Experimental Validation**: The authors test their approach on a variety of datasets and modalities, enhancing the applicability of their findings. The significant improvements in performance across various regression challenges, such as dealing with imbalanced datasets and transfer learning, are particularly impressive.

4. **Effective Baseline Comparisons**: The paper successfully positions SupReMix within the current literature by comparing its results against a wide array of baseline techniques, including both supervised contrastive learning methods and conventional regression practices.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Limited Discussion on Recent Methods**: While the paper compares SupReMix to established baseline methods, it would benefit from a deeper exploration of its comparisons to newer methodologies developed in the last couple of years within the regression learning domain. Including these would help clarify SupReMix's relevance in contemporary research.

2. **Insufficient Real-World Application Context**: The paper does not address the practical applications of the proposed method in real-world contexts adequately. Although the experimental results are compelling, discussing how SupReMix could be applied in specific fields (such as healthcare or age estimation) would increase the paper's relevance.

3. **Need for Justification of Hyperparameter Selections**: The paper briefly touches on result sensitivity to hyperparameter choices, like the Beta distribution parameters for Mix-neg generation, but lacks an in-depth discussion. Providing a wider range of hyperparameter configurations and their effects on performance would offer valuable insights for practitioners.

4. **Ethical Considerations Overview**: While the authors touch upon ethical statements regarding their datasets, a more comprehensive discussion on potential biases present in the data and how the proposed method might address these issues would be valuable, especially given the serious implications of regression predictions in sensitive areas like healthcare.

#### Additional Points

- The authors should consider including supplementary materials that delve deeper into implementation details, as reproducibility is essential for progress in this field. 
- There is a minor citation inconsistency noted; for example, "Harper et al. (2014)" is referenced without a complete citation in the bibliography.

#### Conclusion

In summary, the paper provides a novel and potentially significant viewpoint on supervised contrastive learning for regression through the introduction of SupReMix. The theoretical underpinnings supported by empirical evidence make a strong case for this approach, although the paper should address the identified weaknesses to enhance its practical relevance and applicability. With some minor revisions to tackle these issues, the manuscript stands a good chance of being accepted at ICLR 2024.
