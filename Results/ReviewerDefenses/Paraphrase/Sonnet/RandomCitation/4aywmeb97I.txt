**Review of "Tackling the Data Heterogeneity in Asynchronous Federated Learning with Cached Update Calibration"**

**Summary:**
This paper addresses the challenges of convergence in asynchronous federated learning (AFL) algorithms, especially under conditions of non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) data, which are common in practical applications. The authors explore how asynchronous delays affect these algorithms' convergence rates and propose a new approach called Cache-Aided Asynchronous Federated Learning (CA2FL). This innovative method incorporates cached update calibrations to enhance convergence performance and provides a theoretical framework demonstrating its superiority over current asynchronous federated learning techniques.

**Strengths:**
1. **Topic Relevance:** The challenge of data heterogeneity in federated learning is a critical issue for deploying AI models on a large scale, especially in edge computing environments. Addressing efficiency and convergence in asynchronous learning methodologies is both timely and essential.

2. **Theoretical Contributions:** The authors offer a comprehensive convergence analysis and theoretical assurances for their CA2FL method. They draw comparisons with existing algorithms and measure the influence of asynchronous delays within non-i.i.d. data contexts, reducing the number of assumptions in their analysis significantly.

3. **Empirical Validation:** The paper includes extensive experimental tests across multiple vision and language tasks, showcasing that CA2FL surpasses baseline asynchronous federated learning methods. Utilizing a range of datasets reinforces the claims regarding its robustness and efficiency.

4. **Clarity and Structure:** The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with each section logically building upon the last. This organization enhances understanding of the objectives, methodologies, and findings, making it accessible for readers unfamiliar with the nuances of federated learning.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Novelty in Algorithm Design:** Despite the improved convergence guarantees offered by the CA2FL method, its dependence on cached updates for variance reduction—akin to existing techniques like SAGA (Defazio et al., 2014)—might not present a sufficiently innovative solution when considering alternatives for managing asynchronous updates.

2. **Potential Overfitting in Experiments:** While the empirical results indicate notable improvements in certain tests, there is concern that the experiments rely on a narrow selection of benchmark datasets. A broader validation across diverse applications and real-world situations could provide stronger evidence for the claimed advantages.

3. **Lack of Comparative Analysis with Other Recent Works:** The paper would benefit from including comparisons with other recent literature exploring data heterogeneity in federated learning, particularly methods addressing arbitrary communication patterns (e.g., Hathcock et al., 2024).

4. **Clarification Needed on Memory Overhead:** Although the authors assert that CA2FL does not add extra communication or computation costs, the memory overhead involved in caching updates on the server may require further explanation, especially considering large model training contexts.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, the paper offers significant insights and contributions to improving the convergence of asynchronous federated learning methods grappling with non-i.i.d. data distributions. It establishes a solid theoretical and empirical basis for the CA2FL approach. Nonetheless, certain aspects, particularly regarding the novelty of the algorithm and broader empirical testing, could use enhancement to amplify the work's impact and applicability.

**Recommendation:** Accept with minor revisions.
