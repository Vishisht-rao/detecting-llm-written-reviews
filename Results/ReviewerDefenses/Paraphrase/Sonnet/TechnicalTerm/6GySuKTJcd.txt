**Review of the Paper: "Energy-Guided Continuous Entropic Barycenter Estimation for General Costs"**

**Summary:**
The authors introduce a new algorithm designed to approximate continuous Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) barycenters, specifically for various cost functions and leveraging a dual reformulation of EOT via weak Optimal Transport concepts. They identify significant challenges faced by existing approaches and present their contributions, which encompass theoretical assurances and empirical demonstrations. The paper showcases the compatibility of the algorithm with Energy-Based Models (EBMs) and illustrates its effectiveness across both low-dimensional and high-dimensional (image) scenarios, claiming advancements over current methods.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Method:** The paper tackles the intricate issue of EOT barycenters with arbitrary costs, marking a significant progression since many existing techniques are restricted to particular cost functions, like \( \ell^2 \).

2. **Theoretical Innovations:** By establishing quality bounds and global approximation guarantees for the proposed approach, the authors make a noteworthy contribution to the literature, providing a robust theoretical basis that is frequently absent in similar studies.

3. **Comprehensive Validation:** The authors conduct thorough experiments across a range of scenarios, encompassing both low-dimensional synthetic data and complex high-dimensional image data, effectively demonstrating the practical applicability of their method.

4. **Integration with Energy-Based Models:** The alignment of the approach with EBMs supports a cohesive learning process and alleviates typical optimization-related challenges in this context.

5. **Clear Writing and Organization:** The paper is logically organized, making it easy for readers to follow the motivation, theoretical framework, and empirical findings. The notation used is consistent and clearly presented.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Implementation Complexity:** If implemented as proposed, the complexity of the algorithm may limit its practical usability. Additional details on practical implementation, particularly concerning MCMC sampling and convergence rates, would be beneficial.

2. **Minimal Hyperparameter Discussion:** Although the experimental evaluation is thorough, the discussion concerning the sensitivity of results to various hyperparameters, such as the regularization coefficient \( \epsilon \), is insufficient. An exploration of how changes in these parameters affect results could deepen understanding of the method's practical applications.

3. **Sample Quality Dependence:** Like many methods in this area, the efficacy of their approach is closely tied to the quality of the samples obtained from the underlying distributions. Investigating scenarios involving limited or noisy data would be advantageous.

4. **Insufficient Real-World Case Studies:** While the proposed method indicates promise for real-world applications, the paper falls short of providing specific case studies or in-depth analysis regarding its performance in practical situations beyond the presented experimental setups.

**Minor Comments:**
- The term "selective rationalization" is cited but not sufficiently explained, which could be a relevant connection to the experimental results or theoretical claims.
- Incorporating more recent citations in the related work section could enhance the contextual background and offer a more comprehensive view of the field.

**Conclusion:**
This paper makes a significant contribution to the domain of optimal transport by presenting a method for estimating EOT barycenters for general costs. The integration of theoretical depth and empirical assessment is praiseworthy. However, to facilitate broader applicability, additional efforts to simplify the approach, analyze sensitivity, and explore real-world applications are essential. Overall, I recommend this paper for publication with minor revisions to address the outlined comments.
