**Review of the Paper "Implicit Stacked Autoregressive Model for Weather Forecasting"**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces a new framework called the Implicit Stacked Autoregressive Model for Weather Forecasting (IAM4WF), aimed at improving the precision of weather forecasts. The authors note that while autoregressive models are widely used for time series analysis, they face challenges with error propagation over longer forecasting intervals. IAM4WF seeks to overcome this issue by merging autoregressive techniques with lead-time embedding methods, thereby maintaining spatiotemporal correlations while enhancing predictive accuracy.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Model Design**: The IAM4WF model successfully integrates traditional autoregressive elements with a lead-time embedding strategy, which helps reduce error accumulation—an acknowledged difficulty in weather forecasting.
2. **Extensive Evaluation**: The model undergoes testing on multiple weather and climate datasets (SEVIR, ICAR-ENSO, WeatherBench), as well as video frame prediction datasets. The performance results suggest that IAM4WF outperforms existing approaches, confirming the model's effectiveness across various contexts.
3. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The authors provide ablation studies that clarify the contributions of different components in IAM4WF, improving understanding of the model's design choices.
4. **Strong Results**: The findings—both quantitative metrics and visual assessments—demonstrate that IAM4WF generates clear and accurate predictions, underscoring its potential for practical use in meteorological forecasting.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Lead Time Flexibility**: While IAM4WF effectively tackles error propagation, it shows constraints in lead time flexibility, as mentioned in the conclusion. This flexibility is crucial for adaptive forecasting in operational scenarios. The authors indicate that they plan to address this limitation in future research.
2. **Implementation Complexity**: While the model's architecture is innovative, its complexity may make it challenging to implement, requiring significant resources and expertise for future researchers or practitioners to replicate it.
3. **Requirement for Real-World Testing**: Although quantitative results are provided, showcasing real-world applications or case studies would strengthen the model’s relevance and demonstrate its practical benefits in operational environments.
4. **Insufficient Discussion of "Front Door Criterion"**: The paper lacks a thorough discussion or definition of the "front door criterion," which could help readers grasp this important concept commonly used in causal inference. This could be seen as a missed opportunity for further clarification.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
- Additional evaluations in real-world contexts, potentially in collaboration with meteorological organizations, would bolster the validation of the model's accuracy and usability in practical situations.
- Streamlining the explanation of the model architecture could make it more accessible to practitioners interested in implementation.
- Providing a more detailed treatment of the "front door criterion" in relation to IAM4WF would clarify its significance and implications for forecasting.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of weather forecasting with the introduction of the IAM4WF framework. Its thorough evaluation and the reported advancements over standard datasets highlight its significant potential. However, addressing the limitations identified—particularly regarding lead time flexibility and operational usability—could enhance its applicability in real-world meteorological tasks. The framework serves as a solid foundation for further exploration in this critical area of research.
