**Review of "Fusplace: The Fine-Grained Chip Placement with Hybrid Action Spaces and Feature Fusion"**

**Summary:**
This paper introduces Fusplace, an innovative reinforcement learning framework designed to improve the chip placement process within Electronic Design Automation (EDA). The authors tackle shortcomings in current AI-based approaches, particularly the challenges faced by graph neural networks and convolutional neural networks in achieving the necessary precision for chip placement. The framework utilizes a hybrid action space structure (P-DQN) that facilitates more accurate coordinate placements and incorporates a feature fusion representation system aimed at enhancing both interpretability and efficiency. The authors assert that their method's effectiveness is evidenced by experimental outcomes.

**Strengths:**
1. **Relevance and Significance:** The issue of chip placement is highly pertinent in EDA, and the shift toward AI-driven techniques is timely due to the growing complexity of chip designs.
2. **Innovative Framework:** The development of a hybrid action space via P-DQN is a commendable effort to boost placement accuracy, potentially addressing the shortcomings of conventional models.
3. **Feature Fusion:** The feature fusion approach, which separates netlist data into local and global elements, seems creative and provides a systematic method for managing the relevant interactions among various design components.
4. **Clear Articulation of Motivation:** The authors effectively outline the difficulties encountered in both traditional and cutting-edge methods, allowing their work to be well-positioned within the current literature.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Insufficient Comparative Analysis:** Although the paper references various existing techniques, it lacks a detailed comparative assessment and benchmarking against these methods. A clearer demonstration of how Fusplace exceeds these alternatives in aspects such as runtime, accuracy, and convergence would strengthen its claims.
2. **Experimental Detail:** A more comprehensive explanation of the experimental framework is needed. Information regarding data sets, evaluation metrics, and thorough results showcasing both the advantages and limitations of the proposed system is essential.
3. **Absence of Explicit Use Cases:** While the paper discusses physical design, it does not include specific examples or case studies illustrating the practical applications or implementations of the Fusplace framework.
4. **Theoretical Foundations:** Although the paper introduces the Markov Decision Process and the Q-learning framework, additional detail on how these mathematical concepts support the proposed methods would improve understanding for the readers.

**Minor Points:**
- The document contains several typographical and formatting issues which may distract readers (e.g., grammatical errors, inconsistent referencing).
- The abstract could be more succinct, as key points regarding novelty and outcomes are obscured by lengthy explanations.
- The term "controllable video generation" is not addressed in the paper, leading to confusion, particularly as it could be relevant to feature representation—clarifying any implicit connections to this concept would be beneficial.

**Overall Evaluation:**
This paper presents an interesting strategy for addressing the challenging issue of chip placement through reinforcement learning. The description of the Fusplace framework and its prospective benefits is promising; however, the work would benefit from more thorough comparative analysis, greater experimental detail, and real-world application examples, which are all vital for validating the proposed method’s effectiveness in the research community. I recommend revisions concentrated on these areas to improve the clarity and significance of the research prior to resubmission.
