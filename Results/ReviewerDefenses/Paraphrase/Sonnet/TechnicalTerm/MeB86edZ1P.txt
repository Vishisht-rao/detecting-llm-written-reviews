**Review of "Hebbian Learning Based Orthogonal Projection for Continual Learning of Spiking Neural Networks"**

**Summary:**
This paper introduces a new technique for continual learning in spiking neural networks (SNNs), called Hebbian Learning Based Orthogonal Projection (HLOP). The authors argue that conventional methods to tackle catastrophic forgetting in neural networks often overlook the biological relevance of learning systems. The HLOP approach utilizes lateral connections and Hebbian learning to selectively adjust synaptic weights, thereby reducing interference during the acquisition of new tasks. Experimental findings indicate that HLOP effectively mitigates forgetting across multiple datasets and scenarios, surpassing standard continual learning approaches.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Methodology**: The combination of Hebbian learning and orthogonal projection within the HLOP framework offers a fresh perspective on addressing catastrophic forgetting in SNNs. This alignment with biological processes enhances the plausibility of the approach, which could benefit neuromorphic computing.

2. **Thorough Experimental Validation**: The study includes extensive experiments across various datasets, including PMNIST and CIFAR-100, using different training methods. These experiments provide robust evidence of HLOP's effectiveness, with clear performance metrics such as accuracy and backward transfer (BWT).

3. **Compatibility with Neuromorphic Systems**: HLOP’s focus on purely neuronal operations makes it a promising candidate for real-world applications in neuromorphic hardware, thereby rendering the research highly relevant for future advancements in this domain.

4. **Well-Structured Presentation**: The paper is well-organized, and the authors clearly outline the importance of each section. Diagrams are used effectively to illustrate complex ideas like the functions of lateral circuits and Hebbian learning.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Insufficient Analysis of Limitations**: Although HLOP shows a significant reduction in forgetting, the authors do not investigate scenarios in which the method might struggle or perform poorly. A comprehensive analysis of its limits could be beneficial for future research.

2. **Concerns About Scalability**: The authors note that learning lateral weights incurs additional computational costs, but do not delve into how this affects scalability, especially concerning larger networks or datasets.

3. **Lack of Generalization Tests**: While the study uses diverse experimental setups, it would strengthen the paper to include tests on various network architectures and data types. Understanding HLOP’s performance compared to other techniques on non-standard tasks could provide insights into its general applicability.

4. **Absence of Contextual Learning Discussion**: The paper would benefit from exploring how integrating "context windows" or episodic memory mechanisms with HLOP could further enhance its learning capabilities. The reference to replay methods suggests potential synergies with context-dependent processing that warrant further investigation.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, this paper offers a significant contribution to continual learning research, particularly in the context of SNNs. By merging biological principles with sophisticated learning strategies, HLOP marks an important advancement. Addressing the identified shortcomings—such as issues with scalability, failure analysis, and integration of contextual mechanisms—would enhance the paper's influence and applicability. With its innovative approach and encouraging results, this work serves as a strong base for future exploration in continual learning and neuromorphic computing. I recommend publication with minor revisions addressing the suggested improvements.

**Recommendation**: Accept with minor revisions.
