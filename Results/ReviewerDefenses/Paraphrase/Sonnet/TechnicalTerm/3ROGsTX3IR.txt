### Review of "Grokking as a First Order Phase Transition in Two-Layer Networks"

**Summary:**
The authors introduce a new framework that relates the Grokking phenomenon found in deep neural networks (DNNs) to the concept of phase transitions, particularly first-order transitions. They explore two teacher-student models: one focusing on cubic-polynomial functions and the other on modular arithmetic. An adaptive kernel approach is employed to clarify the feature learning mechanisms within these networks, leading to several analytical findings that distinguish the various learning phases occurring before and after Grokking.

**Strengths:**
1. **Creative Connection:** The authors create a meaningful connection between Grokking and phase transitions, broadening the theoretical comprehension of feature learning in neural networks. By associating Grokking with a mixed phase, they offer a cohesive framework that unites diverse observations found in existing literature.
2. **Analytical Insights:** The paper presents concrete analytical outcomes that improve the predictability of feature learning dynamics in DNNs. These insights are not only relevant to understanding Grokking but also to the broader behavior of neural networks.
3. **Comprehensive Model Analysis:** The selection of the teacher-student framework is well-supported, and the in-depth examination of both cubic-polynomial and modular arithmetic tasks effectively validates their theoretical assertions.
4. **Clear Mathematical Presentation:** The mathematical derivations and descriptions are articulated clearly, elucidating complex relationships, particularly for readers knowledgeable in statistical mechanics and machine learning.
5. **Significance and Influence:** The possible reduction in sample complexity for practical DNN applications may substantially influence future research in deep learning and generalization.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Insufficient Experimental Validation across Diverse Systems:** Although the authors perform experiments with their two defined models, their findings would gain from further validation across a wider range of neural network architectures and tasks to confirm the universality of their claims regarding Grokking.
2. **Possible Overemphasis on Mathematical Complexity:** While the rigorous mathematics is admirable, some readers—especially those less familiar with phase transition theory—might find it challenging. A more intuitive discussion of the implications could improve accessibility.
3. **Need for Practical Application Discussion:** The manuscript should delve deeper into how the insights yielded from this work can be applied practically, especially in model training or design improvements to foster Grokking behavior.

**Comments on Specific Aspects:**
1. **"Matching methods":** The paper utilizes various approaches to align analytical predictions with experimental results; however, clarifying how these methods successfully correspond to the observed phase transitions under different experimental conditions would be advantageous.
2. **Figures and Visuals:** The figures generally communicate essential points well, but clearer labels and legends would enhance understanding. In particular, the phase diagrams could be improved to illustrate the implications of different learning regimes more intuitively.

**Conclusion:**
This paper significantly advances our understanding of DNN behavior and the Grokking phenomenon through a sophisticated theoretical lens. The connection of Grokking to phase transitions paves the way for intriguing research opportunities and practical applications in deep learning. While the theoretical insights are solid, additional experimental validation and more effective communication for a wider audience will boost the paper's overall influence. I recommend accepting the paper with minor revisions to address the noted issues.
