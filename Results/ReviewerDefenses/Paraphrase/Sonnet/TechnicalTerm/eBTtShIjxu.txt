**Review of “Prompt Tuning Is All We Need?”**

**Summary:**
This paper offers a thorough examination of the prevalent use of prompt tuning in improving the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) for domain generalization (DG). The authors carry out multiple experiments to assess how effective prompt tuning is compared to a newly proposed technique named "Im-Tuning," which fine-tunes the image encoder in models similar to CLIP. Findings indicate that traditional prompt tuning methods yield minimal gains when contrasted with simpler tuning approaches, while Im-Tuning proves to more effectively delineate image features, leading to better performance on several DG benchmarks.

**Strengths:**
1. **Relevance of Inquiry:** The authors pose an important question about whether prompt tuning is adequate for enhancing DG tasks, which is increasingly relevant given the trend towards prompt-based techniques in machine learning.

2. **Thorough Experimental Design:** The paper features a detailed experimental approach, investigating multiple datasets (DomainNet, Office-Home, PACS) and measuring performance against various leading methods. The inclusion of a wide range of benchmarks substantiates the reliability of the results.

3. **Introduction of Im-Tuning:** The development of a new method that fine-tunes the image encoder is both creative and applicable. It offers a novel viewpoint on enhancing DG tasks, illustrating that adjustments to the visual backbone can improve model performance.

4. **Performance and Results:** The findings consistently demonstrate that Im-Tuning surpasses baseline techniques, including well-known methods like CoOp and CoCoOp. The marked improvement in performance underscores its promise.

5. **Clarity in Methodology:** The explanation of Im-Tuning, particularly how it optimizes both image and text features, is presented clearly. The paper adeptly outlines the process by which tuning image features enhances overall model generalization.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Interpretability Issues:** The authors note that Im-Tuning lacks a clear interpretative framework. It would be advantageous if they explored or proposed methods for evaluating the relationship between adjustments to image features and the observed performance improvements.

2. **Sensitivity to Noise:** The paper highlights that the method is prone to issues with noisy labels, a challenge often found in real-world datasets. This limitation should be addressed or circumvented to boost the proposed methodology's robustness.

3. **Broader Method Comparison:** Although the experiments include a variety of baselines, a more expansive comparison with diverse techniques (including those using innovative learning frameworks) could enhance understanding of Im-Tuning’s performance relative to other methods.

4. **Clarification of "Any-Framerate Training":** The reference to "any-framerate training" in the review should be more clearly explained within the paper if it is a crucial part of the methodology. A lack of elaboration could cause confusion among readers.

**Conclusion:**
The paper makes significant contributions to the domain of generalization in vision-language models by questioning the dominant focus on prompt tuning and offering a more effective alternative via Im-Tuning. The experimental results robustly back the proposed method's efficacy, though addressing the identified weaknesses could further solidify the paper's impact. Overall, it constitutes a strong submission to ICLR 2024 that has the potential to inspire engaging discussions on optimization strategies in the continually evolving field of machine learning.
