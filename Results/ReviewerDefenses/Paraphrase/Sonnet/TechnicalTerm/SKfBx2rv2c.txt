**Title: Review of "FEASIBLE ALGORITHMIC RECOURSE WITHOUT EXPLICIT STRUCTURE PRIOR"**

**Summary:**
This paper introduces novel strategies for algorithmic recourse, tackling the problem of creating feasible counterfactual explanations from black-box machine learning models without depending on prior Structural Causal Models (SCMs) or causal graphs. The authors offer an innovative framework that utilizes the connection between feature perturbation and exogenous noise perturbation, employing recent developments in non-linear Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to detect and constrain variations in exogenous noise. They present two methods—Algorithmic Recourse with L2 norm (AR-L2) and Algorithmic Recourse with Nuclear norm (AR-Nuc)—which yield effective outcomes across diverse datasets.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Contribution:** The strategy of manipulating exogenous noise instead of directly modifying input features is a unique approach. This allows for the preservation of causal relationships within algorithmic recourse, representing a noteworthy advancement in the discipline.
2. **Theoretical Rigor:** The paper thoroughly explains the theoretical foundations of the proposed methods, including important theorems on identifying exogenous noise and managing its variation.
3. **Thorough Evaluation:** The experiments are well-organized, encompassing synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets. The use of comparative baselines enhances the validity of the findings, and presenting various metrics offers a comprehensive assessment of the performance of AR-L2 and AR-Nuc.
4. **Practical Significance:** The results have major implications for fields like finance and healthcare, where actionable insights from algorithmic recourse are vital for at-risk populations.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Causal Sufficiency Assumption:** The assumption of causal sufficiency may not be applicable in all practical situations. Future research should consider methods to relax this assumption, possibly incorporating auxiliary variables as the authors suggest.
2. **Complexity and Scalability Concerns:** While improvements in scalability for high-dimensional data are claimed, it would be advantageous to provide empirical validation of computational efficiency in real-world applications or with larger datasets, rather than just in simulated scenarios.
3. **Methodological Clarity:** Certain procedural aspects, particularly the identification process via ICA and its practical applications, could benefit from clearer explanations for readers unfamiliar with these techniques.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Ethical Considerations Discussion:** Given the socio-technical ramifications of algorithmic recourse, the paper would be strengthened by including a discussion on ethical implications and potential biases inherent in these methods, especially in sensitive contexts.
2. **Detailing "Covariate Balance":** While "covariate balance" is mentioned, a deeper exploration of its relevance to algorithmic recourse would improve the reader's grasp of the link between causal inference and the proposed methodologies.

**Conclusion:**
The paper makes important strides in the field of algorithmic recourse by proposing methods that do not depend on explicit causal structures. The experiments bolster the authors’ claims, and the theoretical insights contribute significantly to the surrounding literature. Addressing the mentioned weaknesses and clarifying the methodologies will further amplify the paper’s influence. Overall, this work is a noteworthy addition to the dialogue on explainable AI and fairness in machine learning.

**Recommendation:** Accept with minor revisions.
