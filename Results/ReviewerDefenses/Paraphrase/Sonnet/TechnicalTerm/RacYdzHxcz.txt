**Review of "HUMAN-PRODUCIBLE ADVERSARIAL EXAMPLES"**

**Summary:**
This paper introduces an innovative approach for creating human-producible adversarial examples, referred to as "adversarial tags," which can interfere with machine learning models through simple drawing methods. In contrast to conventional techniques that often necessitate specialized tools or subtle alterations, this method enables everyday individuals to influence the predictions of a YOLO-based model effectively by drawing between 4 to 12 lines. The authors test the method in both controlled digital and real-world scenarios, thereby enhancing the discussion on the vulnerabilities of machine learning systems in practical applications.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovation:** The idea of adversarial tags represents a relevant progression in the adversarial machine learning sphere, simplifying the generation of adversarial examples accessible to the general public.

2. **Extensive Evaluation:** The paper features a thorough evaluation, including user studies that analyze the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method. Quantitative results illustrate the ability of untrained users to successfully carry out adversarial attacks.

3. **Real-World Implications:** This research has substantial real-world applications, raising ethical considerations regarding adversarial attacks, particularly given the growing dependence on machine learning in areas related to public safety and privacy.

4. **Public Release of Code:** The decision to publish the source code is praiseworthy, as it promotes additional research and development in this critical area of machine learning security.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Scope of User Study:** The user study included only four participants, which limits the generalizability of the findings. A broader and more diverse sample would enhance the reliability of the results and provide insights across different demographic drawing skills.

2. **Targeted Attacks Performance:** The paper highlights difficulties in executing successful targeted attacks, raising questions about the method’s robustness under stricter conditions. Additional exploration of strategies to improve targeted adversarial effectiveness would be beneficial.

3. **Complexity of User Replication:** While the authors mention adjustments for human drawing errors, further clarification on the method's usability in dynamic real-world situations is needed. Exploring variability in line quality due to user skill or environmental conditions would be informative.

4. **Ethical Considerations:** Although the ethical implications are acknowledged, a more detailed discussion of responsible use and potential regulatory frameworks could enhance the discourse. The authors might also consider providing insights into possible measures to prevent misuse.

**Additional Comments:**
The authors reference "adversarial patches" concerning related work but do not adequately differentiate how their method innovates from existing techniques. Providing clearer distinctions would bolster the paper’s argument.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, this paper significantly contributes to the field of adversarial machine learning, particularly in terms of accessibility and engaging humans with adversarial techniques. While improvements are needed, especially regarding the scope of user studies and a more thorough examination of ethical considerations, the framework established in this research paves the way for further investigation into practical adversarial methodologies. I recommend acceptance with revisions to address the identified weaknesses.
