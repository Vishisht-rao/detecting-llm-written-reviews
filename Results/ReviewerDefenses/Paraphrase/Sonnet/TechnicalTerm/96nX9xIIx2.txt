### Review of the Paper: "Visual Prompting Upgrades Neural Network Sparsification: A Data-Model Perspective"

#### Summary
The authors introduce a new framework called Visual Prompting Upgrades Networks Sparsification (VPNs), designed to improve the performance of sparse neural networks by optimizing visual prompts and model architectures together. They assert that traditional pruning methods have generally overlooked the importance of data and visual prompts in the sparsification process. Through extensive testing on various architectures and datasets, the authors claim to show significant performance gains with VPNs compared to current state-of-the-art pruning techniques, as well as improved adaptability of the resulting subnetworks for a range of downstream tasks.

#### Strengths
1. **Innovative Perspective**: The introduction of a combined data-model approach that incorporates visual prompts into the sparsification process marks a major advancement in the field. This perspective expands the existing framework for pruning and could pave the way for more research focused on data-driven methodologies.

2. **Thorough Experiments**: The paper features comprehensive experiments across three different network architectures and eight datasets, providing a robust empirical basis for their claims. The authors perform a detailed comparison of VPNs with a variety of leading methods, highlighting the performance improvements associated with their approach.

3. **Effective Result Presentation**: The results are clearly presented with well-designed figures that effectively illustrate the benefits of VPNs, displaying performance metrics at various levels of sparsity across different tasks and architectures.

4. **Real-World Relevance**: The authors suggest that VPNs can be easily integrated with existing structured pruning methods, indicating the practical potential of their approach for applications that prioritize both efficiency and performance.

5. **Reproducibility**: Sufficient information regarding the implementation, datasets, and hyperparameters is provided, aiding reproducibility. Additionally, the inclusion of code in the supplementary material further bolsters this aspect.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Insufficient Analysis of Data Relationships**: Despite the emphasis on a data-model co-design framework, there is a lack of a thorough examination of how various types of visual prompts influence pruning effectiveness. A more detailed discussion on the characteristics and design of these prompts could enhance their argument.

2. **Limited Comparison of Pruning Methods**: While the paper compares VPNs with several notable techniques, it would be beneficial to include a broader range of benchmarks, such as emerging pruning strategies or heuristic-based techniques. Investigating hybrid methods could provide further insight into the benefits of VPNs.

3. **Lack of Qualitative Insights**: The findings mainly focus on quantitative metrics such as accuracy and efficiency, while qualitative explanations of how specific visual prompts boost performance or how subnetworks demonstrate transferability are not fully explored. Expanding this section to include qualitative analysis could deepen the overall discussion.

4. **Risk of Overfitting**: Given the extensive fine-tuning and numerous training epochs proposed, there is a concern about potential overfitting, particularly on smaller datasets. The authors should address how their method addresses this risk, especially as the complexity of visual prompts increases.

5. **Generalizability Concerns**: The experiments are centered on specific architectures (ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and VGG-16), leaving the generalizability of the findings to other architectures, especially more modern designs like Vision Transformers or hybrid models, ambiguous. A discussion on the adaptability or testing of VPNs with other frameworks could strengthen their claims of broad applicability.

#### Conclusion
In summary, this paper makes a noteworthy contribution to the neural network pruning domain by introducing VPNs, which incorporate visual prompting into the sparsification process. While there are some weaknesses regarding analysis depth and comparative breadth, the empirical evidence is compelling, and the proposed method appears promising for enhancing the efficiency of neural networks in practical scenarios. I recommend acceptance of the paper for presentation at ICLR 2024, contingent upon addressing the noted weaknesses. Additionally, if relevant, I encourage the authors to include a discussion of the "instrumental variable" concept, as mentioned in related literature, to better situate their findings within the broader context of the field.
