### Review of the Paper "MultiHot Embedding: A Multiple Activation Embedding Model for Numerical Features in Deep Learning"

#### Summary

This paper introduces MultiHot Embedding, a new method designed to enhance the representation of numerical features in deep learning frameworks. The authors highlight the limitations of existing approaches, including significant information loss due to discretization and suboptimal training outcomes when employing small bin widths. The proposed MultiHot Embedding method allows for multiple activations of adjacent bits within an embedding layer, which helps preserve more information during the discretization process. The authors support their claims with experimental results from six datasets, indicating that their approach surpasses leading existing techniques, such as AutoDis and one-hot encoding, particularly in terms of predictive accuracy.

#### Strengths

1. **Relevance and Significance**: The issue tackled in this paper is crucial, especially as deep learning models are increasingly applied to tabular data that includes numerical features. The ongoing lower performance of deep learning compared to traditional methods like Gradient Boosting Decision Trees underscores the need for innovative solutions like the MultiHot Embedding.

2. **Originality**: The MultiHot Embedding method represents a significant step forward in the way numerical features are represented. The introduction of neighbor activation to resolve the SBD (Similar value But Dissimilar discretization) and DBS (Dissimilar value But Same discretization) challenges is a distinct contribution to the field.

3. **Empirical Validation**: The authors present thorough empirical evidence showcasing the advantages of MultiHot Embedding across various datasets and models (MLP and ResNet). The consistent performance enhancements relative to multiple benchmarks lend strong support to their claims.

4. **Sensitivity Analysis**: The sensitivity analyses included are praiseworthy, showing that MultiHot Embedding can manage different bin configurations more effectively than traditional techniques, which is highly relevant for practitioners adjusting hyperparameters.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Complexity of Explanation**: While the theoretical background and functioning of MultiHot Embedding are detailed, these sections could benefit from simpler, more accessible explanations. The concept of neighbor activation may present a steep learning curve for practitioners, potentially hindering the overall accessibility of the paper.

2. **Narrow Experimental Scope**: Despite utilizing six datasets, they may not fully represent a broad spectrum of numerical feature types or application areas. Including a wider variety of datasets could strengthen the validity and applicability of the conclusions regarding MultiHot Embedding's effectiveness.

3. **Absence of Comparisons with Advanced Models**: The paper lacks comparisons with more sophisticated architectures, such as transformer-based models, which are increasingly significant for processing tabular data. Including these comparisons would enhance the paper's contributions.

4. **Limited Interpretation of Results**: Although performance improvements are discussed, the authors could provide deeper insights into the implications of their findings. The connection between enhancements in numerical representation and practical outcomes for predictions in real-world scenarios is not thoroughly addressed.

5. **Overlooked Topic of Backdoor Input Detection**: The paper does not address backdoor input detection, which is essential for the robustness of machine learning models in real-world applications. This aspect could be pertinent for future research or discussions, particularly regarding potential vulnerabilities introduced by discretization methods.

#### Conclusion

In summary, the paper offers a significant advancement in numerical feature representation within deep learning. The MultiHot Embedding method shows great potential, as evidenced by strong empirical results. However, to strengthen its arguments, the paper should simplify its explanations, expand the experimental framework, and clarify the practical implications of its findings. Additionally, acknowledging backdoor input detection could enrich the discourse. Overall, this work makes a valuable contribution to the ongoing investigation of numerical feature representation and is likely to encourage further research in this domain. I recommend its acceptance with minor revisions.
