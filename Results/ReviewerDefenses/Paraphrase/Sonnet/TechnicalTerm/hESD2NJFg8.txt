# Review of "Label-Free Node Classification on Graphs with Large Language Models (LLMs)"

## Summary
The paper introduces LLM-GNN, a new method for classifying nodes in graphs that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) for zero-shot node annotation in text-attributed graphs, integrated with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The authors highlight a key issue with traditional GNN methods, which depend heavily on high-quality labeled data. They propose a strategy to produce node annotations using LLMs and then train GNNs based on these annotations. The main concept focuses on establishing a label-free framework that reduces reliance on ground truth labels by selectively annotating nodes, leveraging confidence scores to ensure high-quality outputs, and improving GNN training.

## Strengths
1. **Innovative Methodology**: The use of LLMs for node classification is a notable shift from traditional GNN techniques, effectively tackling the challenge of limited labeled data by utilizing the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs.

2. **Focus on Annotation Quality**: The authors employ a careful method for choosing nodes based on annotation difficulty and filtering outputs through confidence scores. This emphasis on annotation quality is expected to bolster the model's resilience.

3. **Thorough Experimental Validation**: The paper includes extensive experiments across various datasets, notably the large OGBN-PRODUCTS dataset, demonstrating the advantages of the proposed approach. The performance metrics reported validate the efficiency of LLM-GNN while showcasing its cost-effectiveness relative to standard methods.

4. **Detailed Pipeline Explanation**: The paper provides an in-depth overview of the LLM-GNN framework, covering the stages of node selection, annotation, filtering, and GNN training, supported by theoretical justifications for the proposed techniques.

## Weaknesses
1. **Dependency on LLM Limitations**: Although the paper notes the constraints of LLMs regarding structural understanding, there's a potential risk that relying solely on LLMs with ambiguous structural prompts may yield subpar annotations. Investigating hybrid approaches that combine language models and structural information could be advantageous.

2. **Absence of Robustness Metrics**: While the paper focuses on annotation quality, including additional metrics related to the robustness and noise resilience of LLM-generated annotations would reinforce the claims regarding performance reliability.

3. **Limited Comparative Analysis**: Although the authors compare their methods to several label-free approaches, including LLMs-as-Predictors, a deeper examination of recent developments in utilizing LLMs could provide a clearer perspective on current solutions.

4. **Lack of Discussion on "Subject-driven Generation"**: The paper does not sufficiently address the concept of "subject-driven generation." More elaboration on how annotations could be customized for specific subjects or tasks would enhance understanding of practical applications for LLM-GNN.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this paper contributes significantly to the area of graph-based learning by proposing a unique methodology that combines the advantages of LLMs and GNNs, while addressing the limitations of conventional node classification techniques. The thorough experimental work and emphasis on annotation quality lay a solid foundation for future research in this field. However, by tackling the identified weaknesses and exploring hybrid strategies, the robustness and applicability of the proposed framework could be improved.

The authors should consider investigating the interplay between structural and textual aspects in graphs and further articulate the implications of these interactions regarding LLM-generated annotations. This could pave the way for the creation of even more effective models in the expanding domains of graph neural networks and natural language processing.
