**Review of "ZERO-SHOT HUMAN-OBJECT INTERACTION DETECTION VIA CONDITIONAL MULTI-MODAL PROMPTS"**

**Summary:**
This paper presents a new framework called PID for zero-shot Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection, utilizing conditional multi-modal prompts to enhance the synergy between visual and language representations. The authors aim to overcome the limitations of traditional HOI detectors that heavily rely on fully annotated datasets, which restrict their adaptability to new interactions. By separating visual and language prompts and implementing constraints to reduce overfitting, the authors assert that their method enhances performance for both familiar and unfamiliar HOIs across various challenging scenarios.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Approach:** The paper introduces a compelling strategy to improve zero-shot learning in HOI detection via conditional prompts. The separation of visual and language prompts is a notable advancement that could help minimize error propagation during detection tasks.

2. **Extensive Empirical Evidence:** The comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the PID framework, demonstrating significant enhancements over current leading methods in different zero-shot contexts. These outcomes indicate the real-world applicability of the proposed model.

3. **Focus on Generalization:** The authors critically address the performance gap between familiar and novel classes, which is vital in zero-shot learning. They provide a persuasive justification for their adjustments to regulate the prompt learning process, a critical challenge in this field.

4. **Thorough Experimental Review:** The paper features detailed ablation studies that analyze the contributions of various model components, offering valuable insights into their significance and impact on overall effectiveness.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Model Complexity:** Although the separation of prompts is well supported, the overall model architecture may become complex, potentially complicating deployment in real-time scenarios. An evaluation of computational efficiency and inference speed would enhance the practical significance of the proposed method.

2. **Risk of Overfitting to Prompts:** While the authors highlight their efforts to minimize overfitting to seen concepts through conditional multi-modal prompts, there remains a possibility that the model may become too dependent on specific training prompts. Additional exploration of the model's generalization with varied prompt structures or on more diverse datasets could provide useful insights.

3. **Clarification of Prior Knowledge Usage:** The paper refers to the utilization of instance-level prior knowledge and its advantages but lacks a detailed explanation of how this knowledge is obtained and its comparative impact relative to baseline methods. A discussion on how these priors affect learning dynamics would be beneficial.

4. **Absence of "Conformal Risk Control" Discussion:** Despite mentioning "conformal risk control" in the abstract—related to statistical methods that ensure coverage properties in uncertain decision-making—the paper does not explore its relevance. Addressing how such principles could relate to the proposed method would enrich the theoretical context.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, this paper makes a noteworthy contribution to zero-shot HOI detection through its innovative approach and comprehensive experimental validation. Although certain aspects could be explored more deeply—particularly concerning practical implementation and the implications of the findings—the potential influence of this work on enhancing zero-shot learning in human-object interaction scenarios is significant. Future research that incorporates "conformal risk control” and examines the robustness of prior knowledge use could lead to fruitful advancements in this field.
