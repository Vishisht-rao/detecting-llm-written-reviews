**Review of "CoLiDE: Concomitant Linear DAG Estimation"**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces CoLiDE (Concomitant Linear DAG Estimation), an innovative method for inferring directed acyclic graph (DAG) structures from observational data utilizing linear structural equation models (SEMs). The authors tackle the difficulties associated with current techniques that depend on lasso-type score functions, which require complex adjustments of penalty parameters due to fluctuating noise levels in different cases. CoLiDE offers a new convex score function that allows for the concurrent estimation of scale parameters and DAG structure, enhancing stability and consistency in the estimation of linear DAGs, especially in contexts with heteroscedastic noise.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach**: The integration of concomitant estimation methods into the DAG learning process is a noteworthy contribution, significantly enriching the field. By separating the sparsity parameter from noise levels, the methodology lessens the burden of extensive hyperparameter tuning.

2. **Thorough Experimental Validation**: The authors perform a comprehensive series of experiments comparing CoLiDE with leading methods such as GES, GOLEM, and DAGMA. The findings consistently show better recovery rates across various conditions, including different graph sizes and noise scenarios.

3. **Strong Theoretical Foundation**: The paper establishes a robust theoretical basis for the proposed method, demonstrating that the new score functions preserve convexity, leading to effective optimization.

4. **Effectiveness in Heteroscedastic Cases**: The analysis of managing heteroscedastic noise and the empirical evidence indicating enhanced performance in these situations provide valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Implementation Complexity**: Despite a solid theoretical framework, practical execution may pose difficulties due to computational demands and the necessity of tuning hyperparameters associated with the optimization process, particularly in larger datasets.

2. **Limited Applicability**: The emphasis on linear SEMs could restrict the method's generalizability. The authors express intentions to expand CoLiDE's capabilities to nonlinear and interventional scenarios as future research, and early investigation into its adaptability across various modeling assumptions would benefit the community.

3. **In-depth Limitations Analysis Needed**: While the paper mentions constraints in the experimental findings, a more thorough examination of conditions under which CoLiDE may not perform as well as conventional methods, especially in high-dimensional or low-sample contexts, would enhance the understanding of its limitations.

4. **Unclear Reference to "Quantum Query Complexity"**: The paper's assertion regarding improvements in "quantum query complexity" lacks relevance or adequate justification concerning the proposed methods. More context on its relationship to the DAG estimation issue would clarify this aspect of the paper.

**Clarity and Presentation:**
The manuscript is well-structured and articulate, offering detailed explanations of the methodologies, comprehensive descriptions of the experimental design, and thorough analyses of results. However, some sections could be improved with additional diagrams or visuals to clearly illustrate the key concepts and algorithmic narratives.

**Recommendations:**
- Expand the discussion about the real-world challenges of implementing CoLiDE.
- Consider detailing how CoLiDE could work alongside various nonlinear approaches and the implications for its use in diverse fields.
- Provide a more substantial explanation of the reference to "quantum query complexity" for better clarity.

**Overall Impression:**
This paper offers a significant contribution to the realm of DAG learning and has the potential to significantly enhance current methodologies. The CoLiDE framework effectively overcomes existing challenges and creates pathways for further research. I recommend its acceptance to the conference, contingent on minor revisions to address the aforementioned points.
