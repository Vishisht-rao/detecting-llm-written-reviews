### Review of "XMLP: Revolutionizing Private Inference with Exclusive Square Activation"

**Summary:**
This paper introduces xMLP, a unique deep neural network architecture aimed at private inference (PI) tasks that utilizes square activation functions instead of the traditional ReLU. The authors contend that PI systems often face difficulties with non-linear activations like ReLU due to their higher computational demands in quantum techniques, such as multi-party computation. In contrast, square activations can achieve comparable accuracy while greatly improving the efficiency and speed of inference processes. The proposed model is tested on several well-established datasets, including CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, and shows enhanced performance metrics relative to leading models in private inference.

**Contributions:**
1. The authors put forward a new architecture using square activation functions, demonstrating its ability to match the accuracy of established networks like ResNet while achieving notable efficiency improvements.
2. The paper explores the reasons behind the common accuracy decline when using square activations, framing it within the context of an “information compounding” effect.
3. Empirical data from various datasets reveals that xMLP consistently eclipses relevant state-of-the-art models within PI constraints, boasting up to a 0.58% accuracy improvement and a 7× increase in PI speed.
4. An ablation study is included, substantiating the architectural choices made and validating the hypothesis regarding the performance of square functions versus ReLU.

**Strengths:**
- **Innovation:** The use of square activations instead of more commonly utilized non-linear functions marks a novel approach in addressing PI tasks and opens new avenues for future cryptography-focused model development.
- **Robust Experimental Validation:** The paper showcases a well-designed experimental framework, thoroughly evaluating the xMLP architecture against various models, providing strong evidence for its performance claims.
- **Coherent Structure:** The paper is well-structured, methodically leading the reader from motivation and background to contributions and results, with useful figures and tables that effectively present the experimental outcomes.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Comparison with Other Architectures:** While the paper makes significant claims regarding performance advantages over state-of-the-art models, a deeper exploration of the model's limitations and practical applications could enhance its depth. Understanding the trade-offs linked to xMLP's deployment would be beneficial.
- **Discussion on “Information Compounding”:** Although the authors introduce the concept of information compounding, more quantitative analysis or specific examples related to their experiments could strengthen this argument.
- **Terminology on “Cycles”:** The manuscript should clarify the term "cycles" in connection to any claims regarding computational or latency efficiency, as this detail is crucial in discussions about performance in cryptographic protocols.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, the paper represents a noteworthy contribution to the field of private inference and deep learning architectures. The authors articulate a sound justification for their approach, deliver substantial experimental evidence, and provide thoughtful analyses of their results. Future versions might broaden the discussion on the implications of the xMLP architecture while addressing the identified analytical gaps regarding “information compounding” and better integrating the term "cycles." Addressing these points could significantly impact the design of new PI systems.
