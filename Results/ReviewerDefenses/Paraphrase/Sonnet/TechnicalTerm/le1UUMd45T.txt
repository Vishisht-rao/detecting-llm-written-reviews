**Review of "Solving Multiobjective Combinatorial Optimization via Learn to Improve Method"**

This paper introduces a fresh strategy for tackling multiobjective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs) through a learning-focused improvement technique called the Weight-Related Policy Network (WRPN), based on the "Learn to Improve" (L2I) concept. The authors mix WRPN with traditional multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to boost the pursuit of Pareto optimal solutions. The framework shows potential by tackling significant issues encountered by current methods, especially those relying on the "Learn to Construct" (L2C) approach.

### Strengths

1. **Innovative Contribution**: The introduction of WRPN as an L2I method represents a noteworthy advancement in MOCOPs. The paper clearly articulates how WRPN stands out from current techniques by enhancing existing solutions rather than simply creating new ones. This advancement could effectively address the challenges of diversity and proximity typically seen in L2C methods.

2. **Robust Experimental Support**: The authors conducted thorough computational tests on established MOCOPs, including the multiobjective traveling salesman problem (MOTSP) and the multiobjective vehicle routing problem (MOCVRP). Results indicate that the integration of WRPN into MOEA frameworks like NSGA-II and MOEA/D achieves top-tier results, surpassing both current L2C approaches and traditional MOEAs or single-objective solvers.

3. **Efficient Algorithm Design**: The proposal of a shared baseline for proximal policy optimization to decrease variance during model training enhances algorithm efficiency and addresses common convergence issues in reinforcement learning.

4. **Innovative Quality Enhancement Method**: The quality enhancement method founded on instance augmentations is a noteworthy innovation that aids in exploring the solution space effectively. The framework's ability to converge toward optimal solutions despite such transformations signifies a strong theoretical basis and practical relevance.

### Weaknesses

1. **Implementation Complexity**: Although WRPN demonstrates superior performance, its complexity in architecture and training might restrict its usability in certain contexts. Careful management of weights and feature extraction during integration with various MOEA frameworks could challenge its application in real-world situations where simplicity is often favored.

2. **Insufficient Detail on Augmentations**: While the paper refers to "augmentations," a more comprehensive discussion on the specific methods used and their impact on performance metrics would be advantageous. Though the experiments suggest effectiveness, a deeper analysis of how these augmentations enhance the learning process could fortify the argument for this methodology.

3. **Clarification of L2I versus L2C**: While the paper makes a strong case for L2I, further clarification on the circumstances that favor L2I over L2C would be helpful, particularly for practitioners dealing with complex or ambiguous problems.

4. **Discussion on Hyperparameter Usage**: The paper includes a variety of hyperparameters for the neural network but lacks a discussion on their sensitivity and the potential impact of tuning on results. Addressing this aspect is crucial for ensuring the study's replicability.

### Conclusion

In summary, this paper makes a substantial contribution to the domain of multiobjective optimization by presenting a novel perspective through an L2I framework. The WRPN offers an innovative resolution to prevalent challenges in MOCOPs, and the experimental findings strongly validate its effectiveness. However, rectifying the identified weaknesses, particularly regarding the practical application of augmentations and model complexity, could increase the paper's influence and usability across various practical scenarios.

I recommend accepting this paper, with suggestions for minor revisions to elucidate certain points and provide further insights into the methods used for instance augmentations.
