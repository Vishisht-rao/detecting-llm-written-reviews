**Review of "Large-batch, Iteration-efficient Neural Bayesian Design Optimization"**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces a new framework named Large-batch Neural Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (LBN-MOBO), which seeks to improve the efficiency of Bayesian optimization (BO) when function evaluations are performed in large groups. The authors put forth a scalable acquisition function that evaluates both performance and uncertainty through multi-objective non-dominated sorting. They validate their approach with experiments on two practical challenges—airfoil design and the color gamut of 3D printing—showing that it achieves competitive optimization results with notably fewer iterations compared to leading algorithms.

**Strengths:**
1. **Relevance and Innovation:** This research fills an essential gap in Bayesian optimization literature by prioritizing iteration efficiency over sample efficiency, adapting to the advancements in experimental and computational methods.
2. **Methodological Innovation:** The new acquisition function that integrates both predicted performance and uncertainty for candidate evaluations is a significant enhancement. It broadens traditional acquisition functions by creating a two-dimensional acquisition space that harmonizes the optimization of objectives and their uncertainties.
3. **Scalability:** The framework's capacity to manage large batches while sustaining performance is particularly impressive, which is crucial for practical uses, especially in engineering fields where function evaluations may be costly or time-intensive.
4. **Empirical Support:** The structured experiments on airfoil design and the color gamut for 3D printing effectively demonstrate the methodology's applicability in various complex situations. Comparisons with contemporary methods validate the claimed efficiency and effectiveness of the approach.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Narrow Experimental Range:** Although the applications in airfoil design and color gamut exploration are meaningful, a wider array of test cases, including synthetic benchmarks and varied real-world situations, would strengthen the generalizability of the findings.
2. **Limitations Discussion:** While the paper acknowledges certain limitations of LBN-MOBO, such as potential difficulties in noisy conditions or design space constraints, a deeper exploration of these issues would benefit future research and clarify the approach's limitations.
3. **Implementation Details:** Although implementation details (like hyperparameters and neural network configurations) are shared, greater clarity on the trade-offs between different surrogate models (e.g., Deep Ensembles versus MC Dropout) could increase the paper's practicality for users.
4. **Performance Comparison Evaluation:** The authors provide comparisons with existing techniques, but a more thorough analysis that includes run-time metrics and convergence behavior across a broader set of configurations would enhance the paper's contributions.

**Minor Comments:**
- The mention of "multimodal dataset" is brief; elaborating on this aspect could offer valuable insights into the method's efficacy in multimodal scenarios.
- Discussing parameter tuning in real-world applications may be advantageous. While the authors claim their acquisition function is tuning-free, showcasing case studies reflecting its robustness would add practical significance.

**Conclusion:**
This paper significantly contributes to Bayesian optimization by presenting LBN-MOBO, a framework focused on iteration-efficient multi-objective optimization suitable for large-batch evaluations. The methodology is well-supported by empirical findings from relevant case studies. With some minor revisions to broaden the experimental scope and discuss limitations more comprehensively, this work could be a valuable asset for researchers and practitioners in optimization and engineering design fields.
