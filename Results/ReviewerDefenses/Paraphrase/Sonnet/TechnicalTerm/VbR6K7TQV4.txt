**Review of "Learning the Latent Noisy Data Generative Process for Label-Noise Learning"**

**Summary:**
This paper introduces an innovative strategy for tackling the problems associated with learning from noisy labels by proposing a method that discerns the underlying generative processes of noisy data without depending on pre-existing similarity assumptions. The authors employ a graphical model to depict the causal relationships between noisy data instances and their transitions from noisy to clean labels. Their empirical results indicate that the proposed method, referred to as GenP, surpasses existing leading algorithms for label-noise learning across various synthetic and real-world datasets, including CIFAR-10 and Clothing1M.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Contribution:** The approach represents a significant advancement by moving past heuristic assumptions about noise transitions, potentially improving the robustness and adaptability of the learned models in practical applications.

2. **Solid Theoretical Foundation:** The paper draws on important theoretical developments in latent causal representation learning, providing a robust basis for the proposed methods. This connection may enhance the acceptance and credibility of the approach within the wider research community.

3. **Comprehensive Empirical Assessment:** The authors perform thorough experiments across diverse datasets with varying noise profiles, effectively demonstrating the efficacy of their method. The comparisons with multiple baseline models showcase the advantages of GenP, especially in challenging noisy conditions.

4. **Well-Structured Presentation:** The manuscript is organized effectively, featuring a clear abstract, well-defined sections, and coherent writing that improves understanding. Visual elements such as figures and tables are utilized effectively to convey intricate concepts and findings.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Reliance on Clean Example Selection:** The authors use a small-loss technique to identify clean examples, but the reliability of this method may diminish in high-noise scenarios. A more in-depth exploration of how this assumption could influence the overall performance of the method would be advantageous.

2. **Insufficient Analysis of Hyper-parameter Sensitivity:** While the paper mentions hyper-parameter sensitivity briefly, it lacks detailed discussion. Clarifying how varying parameters like λELBO and λM affect performance would aid users in making informed model configuration choices.

3. **Risk of Overfitting:** Since the method infers clean labels from potentially small subsets of examples, there is a risk of overfitting to these samples, particularly in biased datasets. A deeper investigation into overfitting and model generalization would enhance the findings.

4. **Lack of Discussion on Initialization Strategies:** Though the paper does not explicitly address "random initialization," its implications for convergence and possible biases in learned representations are important. A discussion on how different initialization strategies might influence the optimization process could offer additional insights into the robustness of the proposed approach.

**Overall Evaluation:**
This paper makes a significant contribution to the area of noisy label learning. The combination of a causal framework with the modeling of latent generative processes presents a strong alternative to traditional methods that rely on fixed similarity assumptions. While there are some areas that could be improved, particularly around the assumptions concerning clean examples and the risk of overfitting, the results are promising. I recommend accepting the paper, with suggestions for addressing the noted weaknesses to enhance its impact and utility.
