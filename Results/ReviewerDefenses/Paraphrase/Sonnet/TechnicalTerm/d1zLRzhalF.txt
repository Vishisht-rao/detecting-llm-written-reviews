**Review of "Knowledge Graph Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning Agent Guided by Multi-relational Graph Neural Networks"**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces an innovative method for reasoning in knowledge graphs (KGs) through a framework termed Reinforcement learning agent Guided by Multi-relation Graph Neural Network (RGMG). The authors blend a Multi-relational Graph Attention Network (MGAT) with a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to improve the agent’s navigation capabilities within KGs, especially regarding multi-relational connections. Additionally, they present a Query-aware Action Embedding Enhancement (QAE) module that refines the agent's decision-making process based on the query relation and its current state. According to the authors, RGMG outperforms other leading RL-based approaches in various benchmark evaluations, showcasing its effectiveness in knowledge graph completion tasks.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Combination**: The integration of MGAT with a reinforcement learning architecture is well-founded and represents a notable advancement over conventional methods that rely on less informative embedding techniques. This synergy has the potential to improve the RL agent’s comprehension of KG structure.

2. **Thorough Evaluation**: The paper presents extensive experiments using several well-established benchmark datasets (WN18RR, NELL-995, FB15K-237). The results, which include metrics such as Hits@1,3,10 and Mean Reciprocal Ranking (MRR), clearly indicate that RGMG achieves better performance compared to numerous existing methodologies.

3. **Useful Query-aware Mechanism**: The addition of the QAE module is a significant contribution that enhances decision-making in intricate graph conditions, enabling the agent to adaptively refine its comprehension of potential actions depending on the query context.

4. **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is well-organized and sufficiently clear, making it approachable even for readers who may not have a deep understanding of graph neural networks or reinforcement learning concepts.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Insufficient Discussion on Zero-shot Stitching**: While the paper briefly mentions the possibility of integrating "zero-shot stitching" techniques in knowledge reasoning, it fails to adequately explore how this concept could fit into the proposed framework. This leaves readers with a limited view of RGMG's broader applicability in non-standard or low-data environments.

2. **Need for Detailed Computational Analysis**: Although the authors claim that their approach results in reduced inference costs compared to existing methods, a more comprehensive exploration of the model’s computational complexity and efficiency is necessary. Specific details regarding training durations and memory consumption would clarify RGMG's practicality for real-world applications.

3. **Ablation Study Expansion**: The provided ablation studies are useful, yet additional analysis regarding the trade-offs of employing RGMG in contrast to solely utilizing MGAT or the QAE module would be advantageous. A more detailed discussion on the significance of each component could enhance the readers' understanding of their roles.

4. **Comparison with Non-RL Techniques**: Although the comparisons made with several RL-based approaches are thorough, including insights on how RGMG stands against non-RL methods (such as DistMult and ComplEx) could help delineate the advantages and limitations of the RL approach for specific KG tasks.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, this paper makes a noteworthy contribution to the knowledge graph reasoning field by effectively merging reinforcement learning with graph neural networks. Its advancements are particularly valuable for tasks requiring multi-hop reasoning through complex graphs. Despite certain areas needing improvement, particularly with broader conceptual discussions and computational assessments, the work clearly demonstrates significant potential to advance current methodologies. I recommend that this paper be accepted for presentation at ICLR 2024, keeping in mind the suggested points for enhancement.
