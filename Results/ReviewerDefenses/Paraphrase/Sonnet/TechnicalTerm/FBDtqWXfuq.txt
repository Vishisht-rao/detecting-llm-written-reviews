**Review of the Paper: "Exploring Modality Collaboration with Modality-Agnostic Transformers in Multi-Modal Federated Learning"**

**Overall Impression:**

The authors introduce an important and timely contribution to federated learning (FL) by addressing how uni-modal clients can collaborate in a multi-modal context. The concepts of Modality-Collaborated Federated Learning (MCFL) and the Federated Modality Collaboration (FedCola) framework present a unique approach that allows for the utilization of multi-modal data without requiring clients to have access to multiple data modalities. The techniques proposed—such as attention-sharing, modality compensation, and modality warm-up—are substantively supported and effectively improve the functionality of uni-modal federated learning.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach**: The introduction of the MCFL framework is a notable contribution to the federated learning domain, offering a new way for uni-modal clients to collaborate and benefit from shared knowledge, which is particularly relevant in the context of data privacy and diversity.

2. **Thorough Evaluation**: The paper demonstrates comprehensive experimental validation across various datasets and contexts, highlighting noticeable improvements in performance with the FedCola framework compared to existing techniques. The experimental results effectively validate the proposed methods.

3. **Creative Solutions**: The use of modality-agnostic transformers and research into parameter-sharing strategies exemplify creative problem-solving. The authors effectively address prevalent challenges in federated learning, such as model heterogeneity and modality gaps, with actionable solutions.

4. **Insights into Multi-Modal Learning**: The work offers significant insights into effective knowledge sharing across different modalities, indicating that performance gains can be achieved through parameter-sharing among uni-modal datasets.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Clarity and Readability**: Some parts of the paper could use clearer language and better organization. For example, the introduction of new terms (like "local intrinsic dimensionality," though noted for review purposes) could be presented in a manner that does not overwhelm the reader.

2. **Limited Consideration of Limitations**: While the authors touch on system heterogeneity, a more comprehensive discussion on other limitations of the FedCola framework would be helpful, particularly in terms of its scalability and adaptability to real-world scenarios with varying client capabilities.

3. **Insufficient Robustness Analysis**: The examination of how different model architecture choices impact FedCola's performance is lacking. A detailed analysis of how architecture variations or robustness checks against adversarial conditions might influence results would bolster the claims made.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Improve Clarity**: Revise complex sections for simplicity and clarity. Define and contextualize all new terms and frameworks for readers who may not be well-versed in the current literature.

2. **Broaden Discussion on Limitations and Future Work**: Expand the examination of limitations regarding system heterogeneity and scalability. Additionally, suggest future research directions that could extend the insights of this study.

3. **Incorporate Robustness Studies**: Perform experiments to explore how different model architectures, settings, or data noise levels impact the performance of FedCola. This would provide a clearer picture of the robustness of the proposed methods.

**Conclusion:**

This paper represents a significant and innovative step forward in federated learning by proposing a new framework that facilitates modality collaboration without necessitating multi-modal data. The extensive evaluations showcased the potential of FedCola, laying the groundwork for additional research in this field. By addressing the noted weaknesses, the authors could further improve the clarity, thoroughness, and applicability of their work. In summary, this manuscript is a meaningful contribution to the AI and machine learning community and merits consideration for acceptance at ICLR 2024.
