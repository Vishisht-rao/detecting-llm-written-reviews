**Review of "DECOUPLE QUANTIZATION STEP AND OUTLIER-MIGRATED RECONSTRUCTION FOR PTQ"**

**Summary:**
The authors introduce a new method for post-training quantization (PTQ) called DOMR, which includes two main components: Decoupling Joint Optimization of the quantization step (DJOS) and Outlier-Migrated Reconstruction (OMR). They identify two major issues with current PTQ techniques: (1) inadequate exploration of weight quantization steps and (2) neglect of outlier activation values that exceed clipping thresholds. The proposed techniques aim to resolve these problems, resulting in enhanced performance for low-bit quantization, especially in lightweight models.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Contribution:**
   - The concept of splitting the quantization step into a learnable dequantization step (sâ€²w) subject to joint optimization marks a major progress in the domain. This could significantly improve the performance of quantized models by maintaining optimal weight representation during training.
   - The OMR technique is noteworthy for preserving outlier activations that extend beyond the clipping range without necessitating additional bitwidth, thereby tackling a significant limitation present in traditional PTQ methods.

2. **Experimental Results:**
   - The findings are impressive, demonstrating considerable enhancements over current leading methods, including notable accuracy improvements across various models and bit-widths (e.g., a 12.93% increase in Top-1 accuracy for MobileNet-v2 at W2A2). This validates the effectiveness of the proposed techniques in practical applications.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:**
   - The evaluation covers a diverse set of CNN models and ViTs, providing a thorough insight into the method's effectiveness across different architectures. The use of widely recognized benchmarks such as ImageNet and MS COCO lends further credibility to the results.

4. **Clear Presentation:**
   - The methodology is articulated well and follows a logical structure, with organized sections detailing the motivation, problem formulation, and solutions. The figures and tables efficiently convey both performance improvements and the mechanisms at play.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Lack of Theoretical Justification:**
   - Despite the strong experimental results, the paper lacks a robust theoretical framework explaining why decoupling the quantization and dequantization steps yields enhanced results. Providing an in-depth theoretical basis could strengthen this research.

2. **Generalization Beyond CNNs:**
   - While the authors mention the versatility of their approach, the focus is predominantly on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Investigating the method's effectiveness on a broader range of model types or more complex datasets could offer more insights into its robustness and adaptability.

3. **Dynamic Scene Decomposition:**
   - The notion of "dynamic scene decomposition," relevant to quantization and model compression, is not addressed. Including this topic could broaden the discussion around the potential applications and implications of their work.

4. **Implementation Complexity:**
   - The methods proposed may add layers of complexity in implementation, which could be challenging for practitioners looking to apply these techniques in real-world settings. A discussion concerning the practical difficulties associated with deploying DOMR in various situations would be advantageous.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the post-training quantization field by proposing innovative methods that enhance accuracy and efficiency in low-bit contexts. The strong experimental evidence and clarity in presentation are commendable. However, addressing the highlighted weaknesses could further improve the study's impact and applicability. I recommend this paper for acceptance with minor revisions.
