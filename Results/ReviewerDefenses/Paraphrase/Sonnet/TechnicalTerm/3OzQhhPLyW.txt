**Review of "Meta-Value Learning: A General Framework for Learning with Learning Awareness"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a new learning approach termed Meta-Value Learning (MeVa), designed to improve agent learning in multi-agent systems, specifically in scenarios of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) that involve general-sum games. The authors build upon earlier models like LOLA (Learning with Opponent Learning Awareness) and seek to correct its limitations, especially concerning consistency and the capacity to account for higher-order interactions among agents. MeVa introduces the meta-value function, which enables agents to assess joint policies based on prospective long-term benefits rather than just immediate results.

**Strengths:**
1. **Theoretical Foundation:** The paper offers a robust theoretical basis for MeVa, distinguishing it from prevailing methods. The innovative gradient computation via the meta-value function represents a significant advancement, enhancing predictive capabilities in multi-agent settings.

2. **Practical Evaluation:** The authors perform comprehensive testing on simplified games and established matrix games, effectively demonstrating MeVa's capability in fostering cooperation and shaping opponents. The results are well-organized and provide an in-depth comparison with naive learning and LOLA, highlighting MeVa's superior performance.

3. **Novel Contributions:** The meta-value function marks an important addition to the field, with authors demonstrating how self-interested actions can lead to cooperative outcomes through thoughtful policy development.

4. **Compelling Experiments:** The paper showcases well-structured experiments that underscore the necessity of forward-looking strategies in multi-agent contexts. The variety of tests across different games offers strong support for MeVa's effectiveness.

5. **Detailed Methodology:** The detailed algorithms facilitate reproducibility, and the authors include appendices that explore the finer points of their method, enhancing the clarity surrounding their contributions.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity of Implementation:** Although the theoretical advancements are impressive, the intricacy of implementing the iterative learning processes may pose a challenge for practitioners. The algorithm's reliance on precise modeling of inter-agent dynamics might restrict its practical application.

2. **Scalability Concerns:** The authors acknowledge the difficulty of expanding their method to accommodate neural network policies, which could limit its use in more intricate environments typically addressed by deep learning models.

3. **Interpretation of Parameters:** Understanding the meta-discount rate (γ) and learning rates (α) may present difficulties for users unfamiliar with the underlying principles. A more qualitative discussion of these parameters could enhance user comprehension for those applying MeVa in various scenarios.

4. **Limited Exploration Tactics:** While the paper introduces an innovative exploration strategy, further elaboration on how exploration impacts long-term learning across different contexts would strengthen their arguments. Additionally, a more thorough examination of the exploration-exploitation trade-off, crucial in reinforcement learning, could enhance the discussion.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, the paper represents a meaningful contribution to MARL with the presentation of MeVa, a consistent strategy for learning with learning awareness. By effectively utilizing the concept of meta-values, it builds upon earlier learning models. Despite certain limitations in complexity and scalability, the experimental outcomes demonstrate MeVa's potential for optimal results in strategic agent interactions. Future efforts could concentrate on improving its implementation for neural policies and expanding exploration strategies to further enhance the framework's relevance.

**Recommendation:** Accept with minor revisions. Addressing the implementation challenges, interpreting parameters, and exploring exploration techniques further would enhance the paper's influence. The concept of "behavior foundation models" is currently absent; incorporating this topic could enrich the discussion on learning with learning awareness.
