### Review of the Paper: "Efficient Continual Finite-Sum Minimization"

#### Summary
The authors introduce a novel framework for "continual finite-sum minimization," designed to efficiently tackle optimization problems as data is received sequentially. They present a first-order method named Continual Stochastic Variance Reduction Gradient (CSVRG), which achieves a complexity of \( \tilde{O}(n/\epsilon^{1/3} + \log n/\sqrt{\epsilon}) \), surpassing traditional approaches like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and cutting-edge variance reduction methodologies. Additionally, the authors offer theoretical assurances and empirical analysis that highlight CSVRG's strengths in reducing the optimality gap while addressing the challenge of "catastrophic forgetting."

#### Strengths
1. **Innovative Framework**: The continual finite-sum minimization approach addresses a critical requirement in numerous practical scenarios where data is received incrementally. The problem is well-articulated and pertinent to current needs.

2. **Theoretical Insights**: The paper presents a robust theoretical framework, including proofs for the complexity of CSVRG and lower bounds for natural first-order methods, demonstrating its efficiency compared to existing techniques.

3. **Empirical Support**: The conducted experiments, which incorporate various datasets and comparisons with established algorithms (e.g., SGD, SVRG), effectively validate the method's practicality and efficacy. The presentation of figures and tables is clear, offering strong evidence of CSVRG’s advantages in performance.

4. **Mitigation of Catastrophic Forgetting**: The authors successfully showcase how their approach reduces the often encountered issue of catastrophic forgetting in continual learning contexts, making an important contribution to both optimization and machine learning.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Limitations of Theoretical Guarantees**: Although the theoretical findings are comprehensive, they are mainly applicable to scenarios with strong convexity. While the paper notes this limitation, it could elaborate on how the method might be adapted for cases involving non-strongly convex functions.

2. **Real-World Complexity**: The analysis focuses primarily on theoretical bounds, with few practical runtime evaluations provided. While the authors assert enhanced performance, more detailed information about the experimental conditions could clarify these claims.

3. **Neglected Connections to Dynamic Neuron Ablation**: The paper briefly touches on continual learning but misses the opportunity to relate this work to the concept of "dynamic neuron ablation," which could enrich the discussion surrounding the stability-plasticity trade-off. Exploring this connection could offer valuable insights regarding the implications of the research.

4. **Implementation Context**: The provided implementation details are somewhat vague and could be strengthened by including more information about hyperparameter tuning, as the selection of these parameters significantly influences performance.

#### Conclusion
In summary, this paper makes a substantial contribution to the field of continual finite-sum minimization. The introduction of CSVRG proves to be a significant step forward in addressing important challenges within online learning. Despite certain limitations related to theoretical scope and the need for more context regarding practical applications, the strengths of this research far exceed its weaknesses. The authors have achieved noteworthy advancements, and their findings are poised to shape future studies in optimization and continual learning. Further investigation into non-strongly convex scenarios and a deeper exploration of contemporary issues in continual learning—such as "dynamic neuron ablation"—would enhance the research’s impact and widen its applicability.
