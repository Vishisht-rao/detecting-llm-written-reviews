**Review of “Grounding Code Generation with Input-Output Specifications”**

**Summary:**
This paper introduces GIFT4CODE, an innovative framework aimed at aligning large language models (LLMs) more closely with user intentions during code generation by employing instruction fine-tuning based on input-output specifications. The method utilizes synthetic data creation informed by execution feedback within programming contexts, addressing the prevalent issue where LLM-generated code is executable yet incorrect, thus enhancing overall code quality. The experiments conducted reveal GIFT4CODE’s effectiveness on two demanding benchmarks, ARCADE and DS-1000.

**Strengths:**
1. **Relevance and Timing:** The subject matter is both timely and significant in the fast-changing domain of code generation using LLMs. As the use of AI tools grows among developers, ensuring the consistency and correctness of the generated code becomes vital.

2. **Innovative Methodology:** This framework presents a novel approach by integrating execution-based feedback into the instruction fine-tuning phase. By using the model's own outputs for synthetic data, the authors adeptly lessen the demand for labeled data, aligning with ongoing efforts to tackle "label deficiency" in machine learning.

3. **Thorough Evaluation:** The paper conducts a comprehensive analysis using two complex datasets, illustrating the enhancements brought by GIFT4CODE across various scenarios. The assessment includes different types of I/O specifications and contrasts with leading models, underscoring the robustness of the proposed method.

4. **Qualitative Insights:** The inclusion of qualitative examples effectively demonstrates specific instances in which GIFT4CODE surpasses baseline methods, providing clearer understanding of the practical benefits of the approach.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Narrow Data Type Application:** Although ARCADE and DS-1000 are described as challenging datasets, the Python types examined still constitute a limited range of potential data types found in real-world scenarios. Future research could expand the framework to accommodate a wider variety of data structures, including user-defined types.

2. **Risk of Misalignment:** The authors briefly mention that I/O specifications might not fully represent a developer’s actual intent, yet the paper does not deeply explore the implications of this potential misalignment. A more thorough investigation of this issue and its effects on GIFT4CODE’s performance would enhance the paper's significance.

3. **Broader Comparative Analysis:** While the results are promising, a comparison with a broader selection of existing state-of-the-art methods would be beneficial. Including a comparison with other contemporary models in addition to StarCoder and WizardCoder would give a fuller perspective on GIFT4CODE's strengths and weaknesses.

4. **Need for Improved Technical Clarity:** Certain sections require better clarity. For example, the technical explanation surrounding the derivation of I/O specifications from execution results might confuse readers who aren't well-versed in similar methodologies.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, the paper presents a well-organized and significant contribution to the area of code generation utilizing LLMs. The GIFT4CODE framework holds promise in aligning models with developers' intentions, a crucial aspect for real-world applications. Addressing some identified weaknesses, particularly regarding the variety of data types and a detailed examination of possible misalignments, could enhance the clarity and robustness of future versions of this work. Publishing this paper would stimulate further dialogue and investigation within the community on the intricate relationship between LLMs and programmatic guidance in code synthesis.

**Recommendation:** Accept with minor revisions.
