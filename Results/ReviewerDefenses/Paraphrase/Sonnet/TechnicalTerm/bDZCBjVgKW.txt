**Review of "Fast Post-Training Analysis of NeRFs Using a Simple Visibility Prediction Network"**

**Summary:**
This paper introduces a new method for conducting post-training analysis of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) with a Simple Visibility Prediction Network (VPN). The main aim of the study is to tackle the inconsistent rendering quality of NeRFs, which depends on the visibility of spatial points in relation to input views. The authors propose a visibility scoring function and illustrate its effectiveness through two primary applications: enhancing rendering quality by filtering out points with low visibility and improving NeRF training by strategically selecting additional views based on visibility scores.

**Strengths:**

1. **Original Contribution:**
The introduction of the VPN along with the visibility scoring function significantly contributes to the current literature. The paper thoroughly investigates visibility as a key metric for better understanding and improving the rendering performance of NeRFs, an area that has not received much attention.

2. **Empirical Validation:**
The empirical findings are encouraging, showing average improvements in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) across a dataset of 62 scenes, with enhancements observed in 58 of those. This suggests a strong robustness and potential for real-world application of the proposed method.

3. **Reproducibility:**
The experimental design is well-executed and supports reproducibility, featuring clearly outlined protocols for both training and evaluation. This bolsters the reliability of the results and lays a solid groundwork for future research.

4. **Broad Applicability:**
The authors emphasize that their visibility analysis tool could serve as a versatile solution for various post-training tasks beyond those demonstrated, indicating its adaptability for different purposes, such as "model customization."

5. **Clear Structure & Writing:**
The paper is well-structured, with a logical progression from motivation through to experiments and conclusions. The included figures and tables effectively illustrate the main points.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Lack of Theoretical Analysis:**
Although the empirical results are impressive, the paper does not provide a comprehensive theoretical framework for the visibility scoring mechanism. A more detailed mathematical explanation of the VPN and its approximations would strengthen the justification for its effectiveness.

2. **Limited Discussion on Limitations:**
There is insufficient discussion regarding the limitations of the proposed method. It would be advantageous to address possible failure cases or situations where the visibility approach might not result in meaningful improvements.

3. **Need for More Comparative Analysis:**
The findings would benefit from a broader comparison to leading NeRF enhancement techniques. Showcasing how the proposed VPN stacks up against existing methods would lend more credibility to its contributions.

4. **Future Work Specifics:**
The references to future research directions are somewhat vague. Offering more concrete suggestions for further studies, particularly regarding integration with other NeRF approaches, would enhance the paper's relevance for future inquiries.

5. **Clarity in Algorithm Details:**
Certain sections of the methodology would improve with clearer explanations, especially regarding the VPN implementation and training process. A more comprehensive account of the visibility function's calculations would facilitate a better understanding of the framework.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, the paper successfully addresses a notable gap in NeRF research through its approach to visibility prediction. The empirical evidence indicates that visibility analysis can significantly enhance rendering quality. Nevertheless, the study would gain from stronger theoretical underpinnings and a more thorough examination of its limitations and comparisons with existing methods. With some revisions, this work has the potential to make a substantial contribution to the fields of neural rendering and post-training analysis of NeRFs.
