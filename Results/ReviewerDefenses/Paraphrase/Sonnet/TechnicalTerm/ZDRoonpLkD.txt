**Review of "Revisiting GNNs for Boolean Satisfiability"**

**Summary:**
This paper introduces various improvements to the training and inference methods of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) specifically targeting Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problems. By relating their work to Belief Propagation (BP) and Semidefinite Programming (SDP) relaxations, the authors present a curriculum training method and decimation strategies that enhance the speed and precision of GNNs in addressing SAT challenges.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovation and Relevance:** The authors offer original enhancements to GNNs by connecting their techniques to established approximation algorithms (BP and SDP). This interdisciplinary perspective is noteworthy and could pave the way for significant developments in both areas.

2. **Curriculum Learning:** The proposal of a curriculum training strategy, which aligns the complexity of training tasks with the number of message-passing iterations, is a valuable addition. The authors provide robust empirical evidence supporting the claim that this method results in quicker convergence while preserving accuracy.

3. **Experimental Support:** The paper features comprehensive experimental data showcasing the efficacy of their approaches across different problem categories. The findings indicate considerable gains in both training efficiency and the number of successfully solved SAT instances.

4. **Broader Applicability:** The authors suggest that their proposed improvements could also be applicable to other combinatorial problem domains, hinting at a wider potential impact.

5. **Well-Organized Presentation:** The structure of the paper is clear and logical, with well-defined sections for the introduction, background, methodology, results, and conclusion, which facilitates easy comprehension of the authors' reasoning.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Insufficient Theoretical Basis:** Although the empirical findings support the effectiveness of the proposed methods, the paper lacks a solid theoretical foundation that connects GNNs with BP and SDP relaxations. Including formal derivations or theoretical guarantees could bolster the credibility of their claims regarding the enhancements.

2. **Focus on SAT:** While the authors mention that their techniques may generalize to other combinatorial problems, the manuscript concentrates primarily on SAT. Future research could investigate the application of these methods in other contexts and provide deeper comparisons with existing approaches in those areas.

3. **Decimation Method Details:** The paper touches on the sampling and decimation techniques but does not provide sufficient detail on how decimation thresholds were established. More information on the criteria for parameter selection could enhance reproducibility and clarity.

4. **Underdeveloped Concept of "Non-local Interactions":** The discussion of "non-local interactions" appears insufficiently developed. Although the paper suggests these interactions are significant in relation to GNNs, BP, and SDP, a more in-depth analysis of how these interactions function in SAT-solving would enrich the paper.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, this paper makes a notable contribution to leveraging GNNs for SAT problems through innovative training enhancements. While the empirical outcomes are impressive and reflect significant progress, the research would benefit from a stronger theoretical underpinning and an expanded examination of its implications beyond SAT. Addressing these issues could improve the quality and influence of this work within the fields of machine learning and combinatorial optimization. I recommend accepting this paper with minor revisions.
