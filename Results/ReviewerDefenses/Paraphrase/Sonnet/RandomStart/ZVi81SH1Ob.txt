### Review of "NEURAL COLLAPSE MEETS DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY: CURIOUS BEHAVIORS OF NOISY SGD WITH NEAR-PERFECT REPRESENTATION LEARNING"

This paper investigates a pivotal area by examining the relationship between neural collapse and differential privacy (DP) within the scope of representation learning. The authors conduct a thorough analysis of the behavior of Noisy Stochastic Gradient Descent (NoisySGD) in the context of neural collapse, presenting both theoretical findings and empirical data. The comprehensive investigation into the instability of NoisySGD under varying neural collapse conditions is particularly commendable.

#### Strengths:

1. **Originality and Importance**: The study’s integration of neural collapse behaviors with differential privacy in machine learning, especially representation learning, is relatively novel and of current relevance.

2. **Robust Theoretical Contributions**: The authors articulate several well-formulated theorems that rigorously delineate the characteristics of NoisySGD under scenarios of both perfect and imperfect neural collapse. The theoretical insights regarding sample complexity being unaffected by dimensionality under perfect collapse significantly enhance the paper’s value.

3. **Empirical Support**: The empirical work utilizing both synthetic and real datasets substantiates the theoretical findings. The experiments effectively illustrate the practical implications of the identified behaviors, making the results more accessible and useful for researchers focused on developing differentially private models.

4. **Proposed Solutions**: The suggested approaches for mitigating issues related to dimension dependence due to perturbations—such as data normalization and PCA—are practical recommendations that can inform subsequent research in the area.

5. **Thorough Literature Review**: The authors adequately cite relevant studies, providing a solid contextual framework for their research, demonstrating how it builds on established literature while also establishing new research paths.

#### Weaknesses:

1. **Dependence on Perfect Neural Collapse Assumption**: Although the findings regarding perfect neural collapse are persuasive, they heavily rely on the assumption that such a collapse will occur. A more thorough discussion on the real-world prevalence of this phenomenon across various datasets and conditions would be beneficial.

2. **Complexity of Findings**: Certain sections, notably the theoretical proofs, contain dense mathematical content that may limit understanding for a broader audience. While experts may grasp the material, adding further explanations or simpler examples could enhance readability for those less versed in the specifics.

3. **Scope of Applications**: The paper predominantly addresses clear case studies in computer vision (such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet). Including applications in other fields, particularly natural language processing or other areas where differential privacy is vital, could enhance the applicability of the findings.

4. **Insufficient Analysis of Class Imbalance**: Although the manuscript recognizes the significant impact of class imbalance on both neural collapse and NoisySGD performance, it could have explored varied strategies to address this common challenge more thoroughly.

#### Conclusion:

Overall, this paper offers a notable contribution to the comprehension of differential privacy's effects on representation learning in the context of neural collapse. The combination of theoretical insights and empirical validation lays a robust groundwork for future research. By addressing certain limitations, this work could serve as a pivotal reference for researchers and practitioners involved in the development of differentially private learning frameworks.
