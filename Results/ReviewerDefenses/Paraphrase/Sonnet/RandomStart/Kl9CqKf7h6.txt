**Review of "FEDHYPER: A Universal and Robust Learning Rate Scheduler for Federated Learning with Hypergradient Descent"**

**Summary:**
This study tackles a crucial issue in Federated Learning (FL) regarding hyperparameter optimization and introduces a new approach to learning rate scheduling called FEDHYPER. By utilizing hypergradient descent, the authors present a framework that optimizes both global and local learning rates simultaneously, aiming to enhance convergence speed and overall model performance across various distributed clients.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovation and Contribution**: The paper offers a fresh method for learning rate scheduling in FL via hypergradient descent, filling a notable gap where current techniques often focus on either global or local learning rates in isolation. The detailed analysis of hypergradients significantly enriches the understanding of learning dynamics in FL.

2. **Stability**: The authors provide substantial empirical evidence showing that FEDHYPER remains robust against poorly chosen initial learning rates, a common issue in FL attributed to data heterogeneity. The observed performance enhancements (1.1 - 3x quicker convergence and up to 15% accuracy gains) highlight the practical effectiveness of the proposed method.

3. **Theoretical and Empirical Support**: The manuscript successfully merges theoretical insights with empirical evidence. The convergence guarantees, along with extensive testing on varied datasets (FMNIST, CIFAR10, and Shakespeare), bolster the reliability of the proposed approach.

4. **Clear Presentation**: The writing is coherent and well-organized, maintaining a logical progression from the introduction to the conclusion. The inclusion of figures to illustrate findings and the methodical organization of the methodology contribute to a clear understanding of the proposed algorithm.

5. **Compatibility with Existing Optimizers**: FEDHYPER's ability to work well with established FL optimization techniques (such as FEDADAM and server momentum) greatly increases its potential for practical application in real-world environments.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity**: The introduction of three different schedulers (global, server-side local, and client-side local) might be daunting for practitioners looking to implement the framework. A more simplified strategy or clearer instructions for selecting among these schedulers could be beneficial.

2. **Computational Demand**: While the authors acknowledge the additional computation required for hypergradient calculations, a more in-depth analysis or comparisons demonstrating how FEDHYPER performs against simpler methods in terms of usability and efficiency—particularly in resource-limited settings—would be valuable.

3. **Non-IID Experimental Analysis**: Although the paper mentions the impacts of data heterogeneity, it largely focuses on IID and non-IID cases without an in-depth investigation of varying degrees of non-IIDness. A more thorough assessment of the effects of different levels of client data imbalance would effectively showcase the adaptability and resilience of FEDHYPER.

4. **Generalizability**: Expanding the study to test the algorithm on a broader variety of datasets (beyond just image and text data) could strengthen the evidence for its robustness.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, the paper marks a significant improvement in learning rate scheduling for FL, effectively addressing major challenges through the innovative and empirically supported approach of FEDHYPER. The contributions presented could profoundly impact the implementation of FL systems, particularly in scenarios where enhanced convergence speed and accuracy are vital. Future research could concentrate on simplifying implementation processes and evaluating the algorithm's performance across a wider range of datasets and conditions. I recommend this work for acceptance due to its originality and significant contributions to the field of Federated Learning.
