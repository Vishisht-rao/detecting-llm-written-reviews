**Review of "Federated Virtual Learning on Heterogeneous Data with Local-Global Distillation"**

This research delves into a critical issue: the incorporation of dataset distillation in federated learning (FL) contexts, particularly the complications arising from heterogeneous data among participating clients. The study introduces a novel method termed Federated Virtual Learning on Heterogeneous Data with Local-Global Distillation (FEDLGD), which utilizes both local and global dataset distillation to alleviate the intensified heterogeneity problems encountered during training.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovation and Contribution**: The paper presents FEDLGD, offering a new approach to federated learning that addresses the prevalent issues of data heterogeneity. The authors point out that conventional dataset distillation techniques may inadvertently increase heterogeneity, bringing attention to a previously overlooked concern that is critical for the advancement of the discipline.

2. **Clarity and Organization**: The manuscript is well-organized, moving seamlessly from the introduction through the methodology and onto the experimental results. Clear visuals, such as Figure 2 illustrating the FEDLGD workflow, enhance the understanding of the complex interactions involved in this method.

3. **Thorough Experimental Evaluation**: The experiments conducted are robust, utilizing both benchmark and real-world datasets, which bolsters the claims regarding the superiority of FEDLGD over current FL techniques. The inclusion of various client configurations effectively mirrors real-world situations.

4. **Theoretical Contributions**: The paper includes theoretical analyses that reinforce the proposed methods' effectiveness, especially concerning statistical margins and the connections between gradient and distribution matching. This theoretical support enriches the empirical findings.

5. **Comparison with Leading Techniques**: The authors present a comprehensive comparison of FEDLGD with established FL algorithms, showing consistent improvements in test accuracy, which could stimulate further investigation in this area.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity**: Although the local-global distillation concept is intriguing, a more detailed empirical analysis on the trade-offs between computational expense and performance gains is necessary. While Appendix D touches on computational costs, a thorough exploration of how these costs change with varying numbers of clients or larger datasets would be informative.

2. **Generalizability**: The focus of the experiments on specific benchmark datasets raises questions about the generalizability of the results to other domains or more varied datasets. Future research should investigate a broader range of data distributions.

3. **Privacy Issues**: While data privacy is mentioned, a deeper examination of the privacy implications related to the sharing of local model parameters and gradients during global aggregation would be beneficial. An analysis of the efficiency-privacy trade-off is needed, as privacy remains a key concern in federated learning.

4. **Discussion of Limitations**: The authors briefly acknowledge limitations, but a more explicit exploration of conditions under which FEDLGD might underperform or fail against existing methods would provide a more balanced perspective.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, this paper marks a notable progress in federated learning by introducing a method specifically tailored to address heterogeneous client data through local-global dataset distillation. The contributions are significant, and the approach is sound; however, aspects such as scalability, privacy concerns, and the scope of experiments require further investigation. This work is expected to pave the way for more research in federated virtual learning, and I encourage the authors to consider the provided feedback to enhance this promising method.
