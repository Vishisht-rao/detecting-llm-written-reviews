**Review of the Paper "ARCHLOCK: LOCKING DNN TRANSFERABILITY AT THE ARCHITECTURE LEVEL WITH A ZERO-COST BINARY PREDICTOR"**

This research investigates the important issue of reducing the transferability vulnerability in deep neural networks (DNNs) by emphasizing defenses at the architecture level rather than the more traditional weight-level adjustments. The authors introduce ArchLock, a unique method that integrates a neural architecture search (NAS) framework with zero-cost proxies to identify model architectures that exhibit low transferability while still performing well on a source task.

**Strengths:**
1. **Original Concept**: The idea of securing transferability at the architectural level is both timely and fills a significant gap in the existing research on DNN security, particularly relevant to transfer learning where pre-trained models may be misused by malicious entities.

2. **Robust Methodology**: The paper applies a clear bi-level optimization approach to strike a balance between maintaining performance on the source task and minimizing degradation on prospective target tasks. The use of zero-cost binary predictors allows for efficient architecture evaluation without high computational expenses, making the NAS approach more manageable.

3. **Solid Experimental Evidence**: The experiments were conducted on well-established benchmarks, NAS-Bench-201 and TransNAS-Bench-101, providing strong empirical backing for the effectiveness of ArchLock. The findings, which indicate significant reductions in transferability (up to 50%) with only slight performance drops on the source tasks, highlight the potential practical applicability of this method.

4. **Thorough Analysis**: The paper includes comprehensive discussions regarding challenges, such as the simulation of unknown target tasks and their performance assessment. The predictive frameworks created for estimating performance on unseen tasks demonstrate careful consideration of practical applications.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Task Embedding Simulation**: Although the paper presents a method for simulating task embeddings through cosine similarity, further scrutiny of this approach's robustness is warranted. Evaluating how these simulated tasks compare to real-world scenarios would enhance the study. A more in-depth exploration of varying levels of task similarity and their influence on the architecture search process would be beneficial.

2. **Generalization Scope**: While focusing on specific benchmarks is advantageous, the authors should clarify the generalizability of their approach to other domains outside of those tested. Future research could investigate how ArchLock functions in more diverse and complex task environments, as well as in real-world situations with unknown target tasks.

3. **Method Scalability**: Although the method appears efficient for the benchmarks studied, discussing its scalability with larger models or datasets would be informative. Considerations regarding the practical deployment complexities, such as memory and time constraints in real-world applications, should be addressed.

4. **Implementation Complexity**: The proposed frameworkâ€™s reliance on advanced methodologies like zero-cost proxies and evolutionary search may create hurdles for practitioners looking to adopt it. Providing implementation guidelines, including potential challenges and necessary expertise, would improve the method's accessibility.

**Overall Impression**: This paper makes a noteworthy contribution to the field of deep learning security through its innovative method to secure DNN transferability at the architecture level. The strengths of the methodology and experimental validation are considerable. However, addressing the identified weaknesses could further improve the robustness and applicability of the proposed approach. The authors are encouraged to consider these issues in future work to enhance the impact of ArchLock within the research community.

**Recommendation**: Accept with minor revisions.
