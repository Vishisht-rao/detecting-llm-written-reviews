**Review of "SPTNet: An Efficient Alternative Framework for Generalized Category Discovery with Spatial Prompt Tuning"**

This paper tackles a crucial topic in contemporary machine learning, focusing on Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) and the effective adaptation of pre-trained models for categorizing unlabelled images, whether from known or unknown categories. The framework proposed, SPTNet, employs a two-stage iterative strategy that integrates model parameter tuning with spatial prompt learning, promising to improve upon existing techniques.

### Strengths
1. **Innovative Approach**: The combination of Spatial Prompt Tuning (SPT) introduces a novel method by learning prompts at the pixel level for localized image areas, enhancing alignment with existing pre-trained models. This method is well-supported by literature and builds on recent advancements in prompt learning.

2. **Thorough Evaluation**: The authors perform extensive experiments across diverse datasets, including both broad and detailed categories. The significant performance improvements, notably a 10% increase over leading methods on major benchmarks, substantiate their claims effectively.

3. **Efficiency**: SPTNet provides these improvements with only a minimal increase in the number of parameters—just 0.117% of the backbone architecture—demonstrating its efficiency and potential for use in environments with limited resources.

4. **Clear Structure**: The manuscript is organized well, presenting a coherent flow from motivation to methodology, results, and final conclusions. The visuals, including figures and tables, successfully convey the findings and patterns, facilitating reader comprehension of the contributions made.

### Weaknesses
1. **Interpretability**: Even though the authors assert enhancements in representation capability with their method, the interpretability of the learned representations lacks depth. A more thorough analysis and visualization would shed light on how these spatial prompts aid the model's decision-making process.

2. **Robustness Across Domains**: The method exhibits promising outcomes in standard GCD scenarios; however, the performance during domain shifts appears to require more investigation. Additional tests across a range of domain conditions should be included to comprehensively assess SPTNet's robustness.

3. **Baseline Comparison**: Despite SPTNet's significant advancements over existing techniques, explicitly distinguishing its benefits and potential drawbacks compared to each baseline would deepen the discussion. A detailed examination of the balance between computational efficiency and performance would enhance the work.

### Suggestions for Enhancement
- Expand the interpretation section to incorporate more ablation studies that clarify how various components of SPT contribute to both performance and understanding of the model.
- Analyze the method’s performance in cross-domain contexts in detail to identify potential improvements and strengthen claims of robustness.
- Reevaluate the metrics used for evaluating GCD, possibly including user-centered metrics or qualitative evaluations of the discovered categories.

### Conclusion
In summary, "SPTNet: An Efficient Alternative Framework for Generalized Category Discovery with Spatial Prompt Tuning" is a notable manuscript that presents a meaningful contribution to the field of GCD. Its proposed methodologies are innovative and hold promise for practical applications. By addressing the identified weaknesses, the manuscript could significantly enhance its impact and provide a more in-depth understanding of the proposed system's capabilities and constraints.
