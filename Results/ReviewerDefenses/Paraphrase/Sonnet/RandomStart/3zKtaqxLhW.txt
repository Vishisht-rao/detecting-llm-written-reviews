**Review of "On-Policy Distillation of Language Models: Learning from Self-Generated Mistakes"**

This paper explores a vital element of knowledge distillation (KD) within auto-regressive language models. It introduces a new method called Generalized Knowledge Distillation (GKD), designed to tackle the distribution mismatch between output sequences produced during student model inference and those observed during training. The authors suggest using student-generated outputs on-policy for distillation, which are refined through a teacher model's feedback, thereby improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the distillation process.

**Strengths:**

1. **Originality of the Methodology**: The introduction of GKD as a means to utilize the generative abilities of the student model represents a significant progression in the field. Prior techniques generally depended on static datasets, restricting adaptability to the student's evolving skills.

2. **Thorough Evaluation**: The authors conduct comprehensive empirical tests across various tasks—summarization, translation, and arithmetic reasoning—utilizing different student sizes and a range of divergence metrics. This in-depth analysis bolsters the assertions regarding GKD’s enhanced performance over existing approaches.

3. **Wide-Ranging Applications**: The potential to combine GKD with reinforcement learning for fine-tuning offers exciting prospects for improving model capabilities while aligning closer to user preferences, as evidenced by the proposed integration of GKD with reinforcement learning feedback to ensure factual accuracy.

4. **Integrated Framework**: The paper successfully consolidates current KD techniques for language models while proposing novel strategies to utilize on-policy learning for distillation. The flexibility in selecting divergence metrics adds a valuable aspect to the framework.

5. **Scalability**: The results indicate that GKD can scale effectively with smaller student models while maintaining competitive performance, making it an essential tool for practical applications, especially in resource-limited settings.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Technical Intricacy**: Although the methodology is sound, some technical aspects may be daunting for readers who are less versed in concepts like KL divergence or on-policy learning. Simplifying the explanations or incorporating visual aids could enhance understanding.

2. **Comparison with Baselines**: While several baselines are reviewed, a deeper investigation into more contemporary distillation methods or variations of existing approaches could reinforce the claims. Additionally, comparisons with state-of-the-art models beyond the historical perspective of KD could offer clearer insights into GKD’s relative performance.

3. **Evaluation Criteria**: The reliance on conventional metrics such as ROUGE and BLEU might limit the assessment of the generative capabilities of the models in specific tasks. Including qualitative analyses or user studies could provide further insights into the practicality and readability of the content generated by student models.

4. **Quality of Generation**: Although GKD demonstrates alignment and performance improvements, a more thorough examination of the generative output's quality—such as fluency, coherence, and factual accuracy—would further substantiate the proposed method's effectiveness. Employing metrics like perplexity or human evaluations would be advantageous in this regard.

**Conclusion**:

In summary, this paper offers a significant contribution to the domain of model distillation for language processing by providing a fresh approach to incorporating self-generated outputs into the training framework. The GKD methodology shows promising results that could aid practitioners in deploying more efficient models. The research highlights both theoretical innovations and practical implications; however, the noted strengths could be further enhanced by addressing the identified weaknesses. Future work might focus on refining the methodology for better clarity and broadening the comparison scope to include the latest developments in the field.
