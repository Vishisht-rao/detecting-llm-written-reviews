**Review for "LLCP: Learning Latent Causal Processes for Reasoning-based Video Question Answering"**

This paper addresses important limitations in current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) methods, notably their dependence on large annotated datasets and their restricted ability to perform causal reasoning. The authors introduce a new framework called Learning Latent Causal Processes (LLCP) designed to overcome these issues by incorporating a causal framework into VideoQA.

### Summary:
The authors present LLCP as a self-supervised model grounded in causality, leveraging a temporal multivariate generative model (TMGM) to uncover latent causal relationships in video events. By emphasizing accident attribution and counterfactual prediction, LLCP tackles two essential reasoning tasks without the need for annotated question-answer pairs, thus potentially enhancing the accessibility and functionality of VideoQA systems.

### Strengths:
1. **Innovative Framework**: The self-supervised model reduces dependency on annotated datasets, marking a significant improvement for practical applications. This could enable the use of VideoQA systems in environments where annotated data is limited.

2. **Causal Reasoning**: By embedding causal inference into VideoQA tasks, the authors improve the interpretability of the answers and bolster the system's capacity for making informed predictions about events.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The authors performed extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, showcasing LLCP's effectiveness in identifying the root causes of accidents and predicting counterfactual scenarios. The findings demonstrate competitive performance against leading supervised methods.

4. **Methodological Rigor**: The paper presents a robust methodological framework, with clear definitions and strong theoretical foundations, especially regarding Granger causality, enhancing the basis of LLCP.

5. **Practical Implementations**: The use of techniques like grammatical parsing and pre-trained vision-language models (CLIP) provides a practical approach, ensuring the model can handle reasoning questions in natural language.

### Weaknesses:
1. **Assumptions of Granger Causality**: The model is heavily dependent on the assumptions associated with Granger causality, which might not be applicable in all real-world contexts. Future research should consider how to relax these assumptions and address potential confounders or changing dynamics.

2. **Dependence on Pre-trained Models**: The reliance on pre-trained models, while facilitating learning, may complicate the interpretability of the causal processes derived by LLCP. Developing approaches to gain causal insights without significant pre-training would improve the modelâ€™s robustness.

3. **Limited Diversity of Datasets**: Although the framework performed well on the datasets examined (SUTD-TrafficQA and Causal-VidQA), validating it across a wider range of video contexts and scenarios would enhance the generalizability of the conclusions.

4. **Complexity of Causal Relationships**: The paper could benefit from a deeper exploration of the complexities involved in the causal relationships that LLCP aims to model. An explicit discussion on adapting the framework to more intricate scenarios with multiple causal pathways might be advantageous.

### Conclusion:
In summary, LLCP represents a significant advancement in the VideoQA domain by integrating causal reasoning into the analytical framework. The authors effectively tackle a critical research gap, offering a model that enhances reasoning capabilities while decreasing dependency on extensive annotations. Despite some limitations related to underlying assumptions and data variety, the contributions of this paper are noteworthy and should motivate further exploration of causal-driven approaches in multimodal AI systems. The work is well-organized and marks a substantial progression toward creating more robust, annotation-independent VideoQA methodologies. I recommend accepting this paper at the conference, as it introduces original and impactful concepts for the community.
