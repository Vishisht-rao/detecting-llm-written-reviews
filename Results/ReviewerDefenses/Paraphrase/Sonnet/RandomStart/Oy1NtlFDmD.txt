**Review of "STRUCT DROP: A STRUCTURED RANDOM ALGORITHM TOWARDS EFFICIENT LARGE-SCALE GRAPH TRAINING"**

This paper examines a significant hurdle in the training of graph neural networks (GNNs) related to their inefficiency when dealing with large graphs, largely due to the intensive computation involved in sparse operations. The authors introduce an innovative approach called StructDrop, which involves selective random sampling of rows and columns in sparse matrices to enhance the training efficiency of GNNs. They highlight two primary drawbacks of conventional sampling methods: inefficiency in memory access and the risk of under-fitting caused by predictable sampling patterns. StructDrop seeks to overcome these challenges, showcasing improvements in both training speed and model performance across various datasets.

### Strengths:
1. **Innovative Contribution**: The suggestion of StructDrop as a method for uniformly sampling column-row pairs marks a substantial step forward in speeding up sparse matrix operations in GNN training, with potential significant impacts on scaling GNNs for practical applications.

2. **In-Depth Experiments**: The authors carry out thorough experiments that compare StructDrop to existing methods (such as traditional full-batch training, top-k sampling, and DropEdge), revealing considerable efficiency improvements. The results quantitatively demonstrate speed increases (up to 6.48x for end-to-end training) while preserving or enhancing accuracy, which strongly supports the method's effectiveness.

3. **Thoughtful Analysis**: The paper provides insightful analysis on the underfitting challenges linked to current sampling methods and how Uniform Sampling helps alleviate this concern. Additionally, the integration of instance normalization to keep node embeddings stable amid random sampling is a constructive enhancement that enriches the proposed technique.

4. **Effective Data Presentation**: The authors include clear tables and figures that succinctly showcase the performance of StructDrop across various datasets and conditions, illustrating how the method stacks up against baseline approaches regarding accuracy and computational efficiency.

### Weaknesses:
1. **Theoretical Analysis Lacking**: Although the empirical findings are robust, the paper would be strengthened by a more formal theoretical examination of the advantages of uniform sampling over traditional methods. Providing mathematical assurances regarding the proposed method would solidify the claims.

2. **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters**: The dependence on a sampling ratio as the main hyperparameter raises questions about optimization strategies. While detailed ablation studies are provided, further investigation into how StructDrop can adapt to various datasets or GNN architectures would improve the practical utility of this method.

3. **Scalability Discussion Needed**: Even though experiments on large datasets are included, the paper could benefit from a discussion on the scalability of StructDrop in extremely large graph contexts, particularly within distributed computing frameworks. Given that GNNs are often utilized in such settings, understanding how well StructDrop performs or generalizes in these scenarios would be pertinent.

4. **Lack of Competitive Benchmarks**: The paper could enhance its comparisons by including more recent or alternative advanced GNN training methods. This would provide a clearer perspective on the significance of StructDrop and better highlight its advantages or limitations.

### Conclusion:
This paper offers a valuable contribution to the GNN training domain by presenting an effective and practical method for expediting sparse operations through uniform random sampling. The method shows potential in tackling underfitting challenges and improving generalization. Although further theoretical exploration and development are needed, the empirical evidence strongly corroborates the authors' claims. This research represents a noteworthy advancement in optimizing GNN performance on large-scale graphs and holds promise for wide-ranging applications in the field.

**Recommendation for Acceptance**: With minor revisions addressing the pointed weaknesses, the paper should be considered for acceptance at the ICLR 2024 conference.
