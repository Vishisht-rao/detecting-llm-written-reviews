**Review of "MULTI-SCALE PROTEIN LANGUAGE MODEL FOR UNIFIED MOLECULAR MODELING"**

This paper addresses a significant issue in molecular modeling: the shortcomings of existing protein language models, which primarily function at the residue level and inadequately include atomic-level data. The authors introduce ms-ESM, a multi-scale protein language model designed to enable a cohesive molecular modeling approach incorporating both protein and small molecule data while utilizing an innovative pre-training strategy and multi-scale position encoding.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Approach:** The introduction of a multi-scale model that merges residue and atomic details represents a notable progression in the field. By employing a code-switching method similar to that used in multilingual models, the authors effectively tackle the vocabulary mismatches encountered across various scales.

2. **Thorough Experimental Analysis:** The authors conduct a comprehensive experimental assessment across multiple tasks, including protein-molecule, protein-only, and molecule-only challenges. The ms-ESM model's performance is consistently competitive and frequently outperforms earlier state-of-the-art methods, providing strong evidence for its effectiveness.

3. **Clear Methodological Explanation:** The paper outlines the methodology for developing the multi-scale code-switch sequences and position encodings in a clear manner. The authors effectively explain the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Pair-wise Distance Recovery (PDR) tasks, ensuring transparency in their innovative techniques.

4. **Extensive Ablation Studies:** The detailed ablation studies presented offer insights into how various components of the model influence overall performance. This detailed approach helps justify the model's design and highlights potential areas for further research.

5. **Structured Literature Review:** The introduction and related work sections are well organized, supplying essential context by examining the evolution of protein language models, their applications, and existing challenges.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Scaling Concerns:** Although the authors mention their model's efficiency in dealing with molecular data, the manuscript could be improved by explicitly discussing how it scales with larger datasets or more intricate molecules. While the current results are promising, concerns about future scalability, given the variability in protein sizes, should be addressed.

2. **Generalization to Various Chemical Spaces:** The results indicate good performance in select tasks, but the paper should further discuss the model's capacity to generalize across different chemical environments and molecular typesâ€”an essential aspect for real-world applications in drug discovery and bioinformatics.

3. **Enhancements in Visualizations:** The visualization comparisons offered in the paper could be improved. Currently, they demonstrate the distinctions between ms-ESM and previous models, but a clearer explanation of how these differences lead to enhanced model performance would add significant value.

4. **Risk of Overfitting:** Given the complexity of the model and the extensive number of parameters, there may be a risk of overfitting, particularly with smaller datasets. The authors should outline potential strategies to mitigate such risks in future studies.

5. **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters:** A deeper discussion regarding hyperparameter selection, especially on the impact of weighting the multi-scale loss functions, could clarify the model's performance sensitivity in relation to these decisions.

**Conclusion:**

In summary, this paper significantly contributes to the field of molecular modeling by integrating both residue and atomic representations into a unified framework. The ms-ESM model represents a notable advancement over existing techniques, achieving encouraging results and setting the stage for future applications in multi-scale molecular interactions. With minor improvements and further investigation as suggested, this work could greatly inform both academic research and practical applications in drug design and protein engineering. The manuscript is well-structured and provides important insights into the potential of multi-scale modeling in biological sciences. I recommend its acceptance for presentation at ICLR 2024.
