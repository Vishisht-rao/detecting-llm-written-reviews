**Review of "CNN Kernels Can Be the Best Shapelets"**

This study investigates time-series modeling by merging shapelet-based methods with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The authors introduce a new methodology called ShapeConv, which effectively classifies and clusters time-series data by leveraging the interpretative capabilities of shapelets alongside the powerful representation offered by CNNs.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Methodology**: A key contribution of the paper is the formal proof establishing a connection between shapelet extraction and CNN feature extraction. The authors convincingly demonstrate the equivalence of these techniques, justifying their integration.

2. **Practical Application**: ShapeConv is intended for real-world use, functioning as a fully differentiable layer that supports end-to-end optimization. This not only ensures theoretical robustness but also facilitates implementation within current machine learning frameworks. Its versatility for both supervised and unsupervised scenarios increases its applicability.

3. **Integration of Expert Knowledge**: The authors incorporate human expertise by strategically initializing the CNN kernels, which enhances the interpretability of the generated representations. The reported improvements in performance when utilizing this initialization method further highlight the benefits of expert involvement.

4. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The paper provides an extensive assessment using various benchmark datasets, showing that ShapeConv surpasses both traditional shapelet methods and modern deep learning approaches in time-series classification and clustering. The statistical analyses support their claims of superior performance.

5. **Emphasis on Interpretability**: The proposed method prioritizes interpretability, addressing a common challenge in deep learning. This aspect could make ShapeConv particularly useful in sensitive applications where comprehension of the model's decision-making is paramount.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity and Opacity**: Although the theoretical foundations are well-articulated, the paper would benefit from clearer explanations, especially in areas involving mathematical details. Readers might struggle with the transitions between theoretical proofs, implementation specifics, and empirical results.

2. **Limited Comparative Analysis**: While ShapeConv is evaluated against various methods, including conventional shapelet techniques and deep learning models, a deeper exploration of its distinguishable features in specific circumstances could strengthen its case for broader applicability.

3. **Concerns About Overfitting**: Due to the flexibility of the model, overfitting risks may arise, particularly in unsupervised scenarios with limited data. Although the paper briefly discusses diversity regularization to counter this issue, further empirical analysis or discussion is needed to clarify the practical application of this approach.

4. **Human Knowledge Application**: While the paper emphasizes the integration of human knowledge as a strength, it could provide more detail on the collection, application, and effects of this knowledge across various datasets to better inform real-world model deployment.

**Conclusion:**

In summary, this paper marks a noteworthy development in time-series modeling techniques, showcasing promising outcomes through the innovative ShapeConv framework. Its focus on interpretability within deep learning underlines its relevance for practical applications. Despite some areas for enhancement, particularly regarding clarity and detail in specific discussions, the authors offer a fresh perspective on utilizing CNNs as shapelet approximators for time-series tasks. Future research could build upon this groundwork by addressing the identified shortcomings and investigating more advanced applications.
