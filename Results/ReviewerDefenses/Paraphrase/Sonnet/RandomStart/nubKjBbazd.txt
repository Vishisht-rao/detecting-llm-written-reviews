**Review of "APD: Boosting Adversarial Transferability via Perturbation Dropout"**

**Summary**
This paper delves into a crucial element of adversarial machine learning, particularly focusing on how adversarial examples can transfer between different deep neural networks in black-box situations. The authors introduce a new attack technique called Adversarial Perturbation Dropout (APD), which incorporates the dropout method traditionally utilized in training deep neural networks to diminish the interdependence among perturbations, thus improving adversarial transferability. The paper is well-organized, clearly presenting the problem, related literature, methodology, and detailed experimental findings.

**Strengths**
1. **Novel Concept**: The idea of perturbation dropout is an innovative addition to adversarial attacks, targeting the reduction of perturbation connections in various image regions. This new angle could have a substantial impact on future investigations in the field of adversarial examples.

2. **Thorough Experimental Support**: The authors conduct comprehensive experiments on popular datasets like ImageNet across multiple models and scenarios. Their results indicate that the APD method is effective, showing significant improvements in attack success rates compared to several leading adversarial attack techniques.

3. **Ease of Integration**: The APD method's compatibility with existing iterative attack methods enhances its practical relevance, making it a valuable resource for professionals in adversarial machine learning.

4. **In-depth Comparisons**: The paper includes ablation studies exploring the influence of various parameters, comparing selective and random dropout strategies, and contrasting with other methodologies (like cutout). This detailed examination enhances the methodological contributions of the study.

5. **Clear Communication**: The paper is well-structured and articulately written, which aids in the comprehension of complex concepts, even for those who may not specialize in adversarial machine learning.

**Weaknesses**
1. **Theoretical Underpinnings**: Although the empirical evidence is strong, the manuscript could improve by providing a more thorough theoretical explanation for how perturbation synergy impacts transferability. A deeper understanding of this mechanism could further endorse the proposed approach and lead to more advanced strategies.

2. **Domain Generalization Limitations**: By concentrating on image classification tasks, specifically using the ImageNet dataset, the results may not be broadly applicable to other areas. The authors should address possible limitations and discuss prospects for adapting their method to different data types, such as time-series or textual data.

3. **Defense Mechanism Interaction**: While demonstrating the efficacy of the APD method against various models, it might be beneficial to include insights on how this approach interacts with existing defenses against adversarial attacks. Considering potential defenses could enhance the paper's relevance within the larger discourse on adversarial robustness.

4. **Results Visualization**: The extensive tables of results could be complemented by additional visual representations (like graphs or figures) to make it easier to convey the advancements achieved with the proposed method.

**Detailed Comments**
- The introduction should emphasize the real-world implications of enhanced adversarial transferability, highlighting practical applications beyond theoretical significance.
- Addressing the ethical considerations connected to improved adversarial attacks, especially in secure and robust systems like self-driving cars and facial recognition technologies, would be prudent.
- A discussion on the computational efficiency and resource demands of implementing the APD method would be beneficial for both researchers and practitioners.

**Conclusion**
In summary, this manuscript makes a noteworthy contribution to adversarial machine learning by introducing a creative method to improve adversarial transferability through perturbation dropout. The experimental data supports the claims regarding the method's effectiveness. However, a more thorough discussion of the theoretical aspects and practical implications would strengthen the overall impact of the work. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions addressing these issues.
