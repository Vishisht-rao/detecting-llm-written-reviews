**Review of “TPOPT: Efficient Trainable Template Optimization on Low-Dimensional Manifolds”**

**Summary:**
This paper addresses the challenge of identifying low-dimensional signal families, particularly regarding matched filtering, which often suffers from computational inefficiencies due to increased signal space dimensionality. The authors introduce a novel method called TpopT (TemPlate OPTimization) to improve efficiency in this area. The manuscript includes a theoretical examination of the convergence of Riemannian gradient descent as applied to TpopT, showing better dimension scaling than conventional matched filtering techniques. Additionally, the authors provide a practical TpopT implementation that incorporates nonparametric elements and can be trained as a neural network via unrolled optimization.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Methodology:** The template optimization technique proposed presents a valuable alternative to standard template matching approaches, making use of optimization on the signal manifold. This advancement could be useful across various applications that need to detect signals within extensive and complex datasets.

2. **Theoretical Insights:** The authors offer a robust theoretical basis for their framework, demonstrating the significant efficiency gains from Riemannian gradient descent compared to matched filtering methods. The insights regarding curvature and convergence basins are particularly noteworthy.

3. **Wide Applicability:** The results from experiments on gravitational wave detection and handwritten digit recognition highlight the broad applicability of TpopT. The method shows marked performance improvements over matched filtering in both contexts, underscoring its practical significance.

4. **Thorough Experimental Analysis:** The paper details extensive experiments that compare the efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs between matched filtering and TpopT, revealing clear benefits of the latter.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Storage Complexity:** The authors indicate that the nonparametric aspect of TpopT necessitates dense storage of points and Jacobians, creating exponential complexity relative to intrinsic dimensionality. Though acknowledged, further exploration of potential methods to alleviate this storage issue could enhance the manuscript.

2. **Data Density Dependence:** The proposed techniques for smoothing and expanding the convergence basin are promising; however, they heavily depend on the data sample density. More discussion on the method's performance in situations of low data density would be advantageous.

3. **Synthetic Data Focus:** The use of synthetic data with known ground truth in the gravitational wave detection experiments, while beneficial for method validation, could be complemented by testing with real gravitational wave data for broader applicability.

4. **Implementation Challenges:** While the framework shows significant efficiency gains, the complexity introduced by unrolled optimization and training processes may complicate practical application. A more comprehensive discussion regarding implementation challenges would be helpful.

**Overall Evaluation:**
This manuscript delivers a well-organized and insightful examination of template optimization for low-dimensional signal detection. The theoretical and practical contributions are commendable, with promising advancements over existing methodologies. Addressing the challenges related to storage complexity and validating the method with real-world data would significantly enhance the paper.

Given its innovative approach, clarity, and potential to impact the field of signal detection, I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the noted weaknesses.
