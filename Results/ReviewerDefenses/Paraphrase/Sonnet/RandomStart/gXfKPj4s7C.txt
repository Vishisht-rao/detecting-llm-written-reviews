**Review of "Object2Scene: Integrating Objects into Context for Open-Vocabulary 3D Detection"**

This paper addresses an important challenge in open-vocabulary 3D object detection: the identification and localization of objects lacking ground-truth annotations in training datasets. The authors introduce an innovative method called Object2Scene, which utilizes extensive 3D object datasets to enhance existing 3D scene datasets. Their method involves incorporating 3D objects from various sources into 3D scenes while generating textual prompts for these objects, effectively addressing both vocabulary limitations and the inconsistencies in annotations common to traditional techniques.

**Strengths:**

1. **Groundbreaking Methodology:** The introduction of Object2Scene to enrich 3D scene datasets marks a significant step forward in open-vocabulary detection. By using 3D object datasets, the authors avoid the complications associated with 2D image alignments and take advantage of the distinct characteristics of 3D environments.

2. **Coherent Framework:** The suggested model, L3Det, effectively combines 3D detection and language grounding. The transformer-based encoder-decoder design is very apt for the task, and the use of multiple loss functions (localization, alignment, and contrastive learning) supports a holistic training approach.

3. **Thorough Evaluation:** Comprehensive testing on recognized benchmarks (OV-ScanNet20, OV-SUN RGB-D20, and OV-ScanNet200) demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches. This empirical evidence reinforces the effectiveness of the method, offering valuable insights into the feasibility of open-vocabulary capabilities in 3D detection.

4. **Detailed Ablation Studies:** The in-depth ablation studies effectively highlight the significance of various elements within the framework, such as the types of prompts and the impact of contrastive learning. This thorough analysis clarifies the results and reflects the thoughtful consideration of design decisions.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Clarity and Organization:** Although comprehensive, some parts of the manuscript could be clearer and better structured. For instance, the explanation of the ablation studies could be more succinct to improve reader understanding, and summarizing key findings or insights in a separate section might enhance clarity.

2. **Discussion of Qualitative Results:** While qualitative results are included, a more in-depth analysis of failure cases would be useful. Understanding the situations where the model may struggle (like detecting partially obstructed objects) could guide future research and model improvements.

3. **Limitations and Future Directions:** Although the authors touch on limitations and future work, a more thorough discussion would provide better context for their contributions. Addressing potential biases in the data and exploring strategies to lessen these biases, as well as discussing the computational challenges of dataset augmentation, would enrich the discourse.

4. **Insights on Transferability:** The transferability findings are encouraging, but additional experimental rigor would strengthen these claims. Assessing performance across a wider array of datasets or conditions would bolster assertions regarding the method's robustness and generalizability.

**Conclusion:**

In summary, the manuscript makes a noteworthy contribution to open-vocabulary 3D object detection through the creation of Object2Scene and its application within a cohesive detection framework. The experimental outcomes validate the authors' assertions, and the methodology presents a promising avenue for future progress in 3D perception. Nevertheless, improving clarity, providing a more detailed examination of limitations, and expanding on transferability assessments would enhance the overall completeness of this work. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
