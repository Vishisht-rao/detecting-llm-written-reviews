**Review of "Exploiting River Network Topology for Flood Forecasting with Graph Neural Networks"**

**Summary:**
The paper addresses a significant issue related to predicting river discharge for flood forecasting by utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance prediction accuracy through the integration of river network topology. The authors conduct a structured analysis using the LamaH-CE dataset and examine different definitions of adjacency to assess their effects on forecasting effectiveness. Their results suggest that conventional data-driven approaches may outperform those that rely on relational data from graph structures.

**Strengths:**
1. **Relevant and Urgent Topic:** The growing challenges associated with climate change and flood frequency make the topic of this paper crucial for both academic and real-world applications in disaster management. 

2. **Strong Methodological Approach:** The authors implement a rigorous experimental design, evaluating various GNN architectures and adjacency formulations. Their thorough cross-validation and comparison with a baseline MLP enhance the trustworthiness of their findings.

3. **Detailed Data Processing Explanation:** The methodology section offers a comprehensive description of the data preprocessing steps, including gauge filtering and adjacency matrix definitions, which aids reader comprehension of the experimental framework.

4. **Comprehensive Performance Evaluation:** The results provide an extensive comparison of different GNN setups, leading to meaningful insights about the limited advantages of using river network topology in discharge forecasting. This design facilitates in-depth discussions regarding the predictive potential of GNNs in hydrology.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Unclear Contribution Statement:** Although the study yields important insights, it could benefit from a more explicit clarification of its contributions to existing literature. The conclusion hints at a rationale for distinct gauge treatment but does not fully explain why GNNs might not leverage topology effectively compared to traditional models.

2. **Results Interpretation Needs Improvement:** The assertion that "the model fails to benefit from the river network topology information" would be strengthened by exploring underlying factors, such as limitations within GNN structures specific to this field or non-linearities in the data not accounted for by the current architectures.

3. **Exploration of Alternative Methodologies:** The paper suggests investigating specialized model architectures but does not propose specific alternatives. Including references to other effective methodologies that utilize graph structures could enhance the discussion.

4. **Expanded Future Work Implications:** While the manuscript emphasizes spike prediction, further elaboration on data collection challenges in low-income countries and their implications for flood forecasting could provide a broader context for the research's significance and future directions.

**Technical Quality:**
The manuscript's technical execution is solid, employing appropriate statistical methods and machine learning techniques. The presentation of experimental results is logical, and the significance of the findings is clearly outlined.

**Recommendation:**
The paper offers important insights into GNN applications for flood forecasting, particularly highlighting the shortcomings of current topological integrations. Given the strengths and weaknesses identified, I recommend minor revisions prior to acceptance to clarify contributions, bolster interpretations, and broaden the discussion on future research avenues.

**Overall Assessment:**
This study is praiseworthy for its methodological rigor and its critical exploration of an important issue, ultimately paving the way for future research while tackling a significant global challenge.
