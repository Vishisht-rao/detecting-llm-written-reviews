**Review of "Simple CNN for Vision"**

The paper discusses significant advancements in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly focusing on recent trends that leverage large kernel sizes influenced by Vision Transformers (ViTs). The authors introduce a Simple Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN) that employs a series of stacked 3×3 convolutions to capture spatial information more effectively than earlier models that relied on larger kernels. This work thoroughly investigates the design principles underlying the SCNN, assessing its performance in various computer vision tasks and showcasing its competitive accuracy and efficiency.

**Strengths:**

1. **Strong Justification:** The manuscript effectively argues against the necessity of large kernels in CNNs for all applications. By critiquing existing models that use larger kernels (e.g., 31×31 and 51×51), the authors illuminate the practical challenges related to computational complexity and hardware limitations.

2. **Creative Architecture:** The proposed SCNN features a slender and deep design that bolsters the model's learning capacity by stacking numerous 3×3 convolutions. Notably, the introduction of a new SCNN block with two depthwise convolutions to expand the receptive field addresses the drawbacks of smaller kernels without the downsides associated with larger convolutions.

3. **Thorough Evaluation:** The authors perform extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets, such as ImageNet-1K for image classification, MS-COCO for object detection, and ADE20K for semantic segmentation. The performance metrics offered are comprehensive, and comparisons with a range of state-of-the-art methods clearly highlight the benefits of the SCNN design.

4. **Ablation Studies:** The paper’s inclusion of ablation studies adds value by systematically examining how critical architectural elements (such as GSiLU activation and block configurations) affect performance. This enhances understanding of the proposed features' effectiveness and their role in the overall architecture.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Depth of Literature Review:** While the related work section mentions progress in CNN and ViT architectures, it could enhance its analysis of the challenges associated with smaller kernel models. A deeper exploration could clarify SCNN's unique contributions within the larger body of literature.

2. **Discussion of Performance:** Although performance metrics are provided, a more thorough analysis of the results would be advantageous. For example, understanding the practical implications of SCNN's better performance compared to several models on ImageNet could provide valuable insights for real-world applications or specific areas within computer vision.

3. **Complexity Assessment:** The paper briefly touches on computational efficiency but could delve deeper into the analysis of FLOPs in relation to performance gains. A discussion on the trade-offs between model complexity and training or deployment ease would enhance the practical significance of the paper.

4. **Architectural Visuals:** The diagrams representing the architecture could be clearer or better annotated, allowing a more vivid illustration of the data flow and transformations. This would aid readers who might be less familiar with the specific configurations in quickly understanding the novelty of the architecture.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, the paper represents a well-organized and important advancement in the field of deep learning for computer vision. The SCNN architecture provides insightful contributions toward efficient CNN design that could inspire future research. Although there are areas for enhancement, particularly regarding the literature context and performance discussions, the authors have established a foundation for improving convolutional architectures. The findings indicate that smaller kernel sizes can yield impressive results with the right design, encouraging a reconsideration of traditional views on kernel size in CNNs. The proposed SCNN is likely to have a significant influence on both theoretical studies and practical applications in computer vision.
