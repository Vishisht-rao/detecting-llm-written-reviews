**Review of "ENCODING SPEAKER-SPECIFIC LATENT SPEECH FEATURES FOR SPEECH SYNTHESIS"**

This manuscript explores speaker modeling within the realm of speech synthesis, proposing a new technique called Encoding speaker-specific Latent speech Features (ELF). The authors assert that this method enables high-quality speech synthesis from previously unseen speakers without requiring extra training on specific speaker datasets. The paper includes a comprehensive literature review, pinpointing the shortcomings of current methodologies, especially in relation to zero-shot synthesis and multi-speaker models. The authors effectively contextualize their work, presenting a persuasive argument in favor of their approach.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach**: The ELF technique offers a promising avenue for encoding distinct speaker characteristics and synthesizing speech that reflects these traits. The innovative integration of feature discretization along with conditioning through attention mechanisms stands out.

2. **Thorough Experiments**: The research involves extensive experimentation using two publicly accessible datasets (LibriTTS and VCTK) to assess the performance of ELF in various contexts, including speaker blending and cross-lingual synthesis. The subjective evaluations using Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and Subjective Mean Opinion Score (SMOS) lend credibility to the findings.

3. **Strong Results**: Results indicate that ELF exceeds existing models, such as VITS and YourTTS, in terms of speaker similarity, naturalness, and intelligibility. The findings highlight a notable enhancement in zero-shot situations and superior output quality for new artificial speaker generation.

4. **Reconstruction Capability**: The authors provide convincing evidence that the encoded features can faithfully recreate the original speaker traits, suggesting that the latent representation retains a high degree of information.

5. **Clarity and Structure**: The manuscript is well-organized and clearly articulated. Each section is logically interconnected, which facilitates understanding of the research.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Clarification of Limitations**: Despite the compelling results, the authors could expand on the potential limitations of the ELF method, particularly in scenarios where it may perform inadequately. Discussing cases involving unique or less typical speaker attributes would be beneficial.

2. **Complex Methodology**: While the method is comprehensive, its complexity could raise concerns regarding feasibility and computational efficiency. The authors should address how ELF might be applied in real-world contexts where resources are limited.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: Although ELF is compared with other existing methods, a deeper analysis explaining why it performs better, particularly in feature extraction and synthesis, would strengthen the case. Additional insights into the specific roles of different ELF components would be advantageous.

4. **Subjective Evaluation Methods**: The methodology for subjective evaluation via Amazon Mechanical Turk for MOS and SMOS, although acceptable, might introduce variability due to rater bias or differences in individual perception. Implementing a more rigorous evaluator selection protocol and a larger, more diverse sample could enhance the reliability of the subjective results.

**Conclusion:**

In summary, this manuscript represents a notable advancement in speech synthesis through the innovative ELF framework. The combination of unique methodologies and robust empirical findings significantly contributes to the field. Addressing the identified weaknesses in future iterations could enhance the robustness and applicability of the results. I recommend this paper for acceptance, contingent on minor revisions aimed at improving clarity regarding limitations, model complexity, and evaluation techniques.
