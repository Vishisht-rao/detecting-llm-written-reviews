**Review of "FASTER APPROXIMATION OF PROBABILISTIC AND DISTRIBUTIONAL VALUES VIA LEAST SQUARES"**

This paper addresses a significant challenge in computational efficiency concerning the estimation of probabilistic and distributional values in data valuation, particularly in the context of cooperative game theory. The authors present their Generic Estimator based on Least Squares (GELS) and its variations, which aim to considerably lower the computational burden of estimating different probabilistic values, achieving an approximation order of \( O(n \log n) \) in numerous instances. This research aligns with the ongoing advancements in data valuation techniques, which are increasingly crucial as machine learning datasets become larger and more complex.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Contribution**: The authors successfully link probabilistic values with least squares regression, leading to new methods that extend and enhance existing estimators across a wider range of values.

2. **Theoretical Support**: They offer strong theoretical foundations for their algorithms, showcasing the efficiency improvements over prior methods such as the sampling lift estimator.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: The experiments span various datasets and conditions, demonstrating that GELS converges faster and validating the TrELS framework for training estimators to approximate distributional values without supervision. This empirical evidence buttresses the theoretical claims made.

4. **Solid Methodology**: The framework utilizes generalization from trained models, which could have important ramifications for practical applications in machine learning.

5. **Code Accessibility**: By providing their code, the authors facilitate replication and further exploration by other researchers, encouraging collaboration and advancements in the field.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Difficult Notation**: The paper is dense with complex mathematical expressions, which may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with cooperative game theory or advanced statistical concepts. A more approachable narrative, especially in sections detailing algorithms and mathematical proofs, would enhance comprehension.

2. **Limited Practical Insights**: While the theoretical components are solid, the authors could improve the practical significance of their work by elaborating on the real-world applications of these estimators, especially in industry settings beyond academia.

3. **Lack of Comparative Analysis**: Although the experiments illustrate GELS's performance relative to existing methods, clearer visual comparisons or more detailed performance metrics could strengthen the case for its practical advantages.

4. **Implicit Assumptions**: Some assumptions related to their theoretical findings, particularly concerning data distributions or utility function characteristics, require more explicit discussion. It would be helpful to identify scenarios where these assumptions may not apply and how the estimators would perform under those conditions.

5. **Insufficient Results Presentation**: The extensive experimental results could be better organized within the paper, potentially through a dedicated results section that highlights key findings, visual aids, and direct comparisons.

**Conclusion:**

In summary, this paper provides a notable contribution to the field of data valuation and holds promise for influencing how data scientists approach probabilistic value estimation in extensive datasets. Enhancing the clarity of the mathematical presentation could improve communication of the findings, and additional practical implementation insights would broaden its relevance. Despite some minor issues, the research is well-argued and thoroughly supported, making it a valuable addition for further investigation in this area.

The authors are encouraged to address these suggested improvements in future endeavors to maximize the impact and reach of their compelling insights.
