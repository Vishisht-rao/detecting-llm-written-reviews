**Review of "Deep Anti-Regularized Ensembles"**

This research addresses the important issue of uncertainty quantification in high-dimensional regression and classification problems utilizing deep ensembles. It tackles a significant drawback of existing methods that typically yield overly confident predictions for out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The authors introduce a new approach called Deep Anti-Regularized Ensembles (DARE), which implements an anti-regularization technique that penalizes low weights in ensemble networks. This method promotes prediction diversity while preserving accuracy within the in-distribution context.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Contribution**: The paper presents an important advancement with the introduction of DARE, which effectively balances in-distribution accuracy and OOD prediction uncertainty without depending on OOD data or requiring extra hyperparameter optimization. This is critical for real-world applications where data distributions may vary unexpectedly.

2. **Theoretical Basis**: The authors establish a robust theoretical foundation for their technique. The "water-filling" analogy provides an intuitive explanation of how variance is allocated among network weights, thereby enhancing the method's theoretical credibility.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The experiments carried out on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of DARE compared to various baseline methods, including traditional deep ensembles and modern OOD detection approaches. Notably, the results reveal significant improvements in uncertainty quantification, especially in regression tasks involving the CityCam dataset.

4. **Emphasis on Reproducibility**: The authors prioritize the reproducibility of their findings by sharing their source code and thoroughly detailing their experimental methodologies, which is in line with the increasing demand for transparency in scientific research.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Applicability of Method**: While the results with fully-connected networks are compelling, the authors' claims about the applicability of DARE to other architectures, such as CNNs, lack adequate testing. Further experimentation is needed to substantiate the assertion that DARE can easily integrate with other network types.

2. **Control Threshold Heuristic**: The method for selecting the anti-regularization control threshold (τ) relies on heuristics, which may not yield optimal results. A more structured approach to determine this threshold could improve the resilience of the DARE framework.

3. **Narrow OOD Focus**: The study primarily examines well-defined OOD detection scenarios. Expanding future research to encompass a wider variety of OOD situations would provide more comprehensive validation of the method's effectiveness in different practical contexts.

4. **Insufficient Comparative Analysis**: Although DARE is benchmarked against several state-of-the-art methods, a more thorough comparative analysis detailing in which contexts DARE outperforms these alternatives would enhance the paper. A discussion of the limitations of competing methods would also clarify DARE’s advantages.

**Conclusion**:

In summary, this paper offers a significant contribution to the field of uncertainty quantification within deep learning. The proposed DARE method, supported by a strong theoretical framework and extensive empirical evidence, marks an important advancement in improving predictive reliability in machine learning, particularly in dynamic environments. Addressing the identified weaknesses in future work will further establish DARE as a holistic solution for uncertainty quantification in deep learning. I recommend accepting this paper due to its contributions to the discipline and suggest that the authors consider the proposed enhancements.
