### Review of "Massively Scalable Inverse Reinforcement Learning in Google Maps"

This research explores the crucial issue of employing inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) techniques for route recommendation systems on a global scale, with a specific emphasis on Google Maps' infrastructure. The authors effectively address the considerable challenges related to scalability, which is vital due to the hundreds of millions of possible states in practical routing scenarios.

#### Strengths:

1. **Important Contributions**: The paper introduces several practical methods that improve the scalability of IRL algorithms, including graph compression, spatial parallelization, and an enhanced initialization approach. These advancements are particularly necessary given the high-dimensional state environments such as the road networks in Google Maps.

2. **Novel Algorithm RHIP**: The authors present an innovative algorithm called Receding Horizon Inverse Planning (RHIP), which seamlessly integrates traditional IRL algorithms, facilitating nuanced control over the balance between computational efficiency and solution robustness. This flexibility represents a significant step forward in the field.

3. **Empirical Testing**: The techniques are validated through extensive experiments that showcase clear empirical enhancements in route accuracy (with noted improvements of 15.9% for driving and 24.1% for two-wheelers). The validation over large datasets significantly supports their findings.

4. **Ablation Studies and Negative Findings**: The authors share detailed insights from their ablation studies and negative results involving alternative methods, enriching the discussion and providing better context regarding the effectiveness of their proposed solutions.

5. **Clarity of Technical Detail**: The methodology is presented clearly, with understandable pseudocode and algorithms, making replication feasible. The figures effectively illustrate the relationships among various components and the improvements obtained.

#### Weaknesses:

1. **Limited Applicability**: Although the paper proposes a solid solution for route optimization within the context of Google Maps, it is uncertain how the suggested techniques could be easily adapted to other areas, such as robotics or different forms of sequential decision-making.

2. **Risk of Overfitting**: The focus on customizing methods for a vast dataset raises concerns about overfitting to specific characteristics of the dataset, including user behaviors or traffic trends that may not apply universally across diverse geographical regions. The authors could address this by exploring generalization across various datasets or locations.

3. **Privacy Issues**: While the paper briefly touches on the ethical concerns of using real-user data for route recommendations, it lacks a thorough exploration of potential biases in the dataset, particularly concerning user demographics. A discussion on data diversity might enhance robustness and reduce unintended biases in recommendations.

4. **Statistical Detail**: The statistical analyses, specifically the p-values used for performance comparisons, could be more detailed. Providing confidence intervals alongside p-values would offer a stronger representation of the reliability of the experimental findings.

5. **Complexity and Computational Cost**: The authors mention substantial training costs, quantified as 1.4 GPU-years, which underscores the complexity and resource demands of the proposed solutions. This factor is crucial since it may limit the practical scalability for organizations lacking significant computational resources.

#### Conclusion:

In conclusion, the paper marks a notable progress in the application of inverse reinforcement learning to real-world routing challenges at a significant scale. The introduction of innovative methods, alongside robust empirical validation, indicates a potentially impactful contribution to both the IRL field and navigation applications. However, further exploration of generalizability, biases, and computational cost implications would enhance the overall strength and relevance of the work. This contribution is significant and deserving of presentation at ICLR 2024, with suggestions for minor revisions and clarifications to strengthen the arguments and findings.
