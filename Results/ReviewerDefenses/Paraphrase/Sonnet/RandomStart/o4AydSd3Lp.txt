**Review of "Harnessing Discrete Representations for Continual Reinforcement Learning"**

The paper tackles a significant topic in reinforcement learning (RL) regarding how observations are represented. The authors conduct an extensive empirical study on using discrete representations, specifically one-hot encoded categorical values, compared to conventional continuous representations in the context of continual reinforcement learning. This issue is vital as agents must increasingly adapt to changing and intricate environments, making the quality of their input representation crucial for their success.

**Strengths:**

1. **Comprehensive Literature Review and Contextualization:** The authors effectively position their work within the larger RL landscape. By referencing previous studies, including those by Hafner et al. and van den Oord et al., the paper builds a strong foundation for its goals and motivations, demonstrating a deep understanding of advancements in representation learning.

2. **Robust Empirical Validation:** The authors provide a wide range of experiments that methodically compare discrete and continuous representations across various scenarios, including world-model learning and model-free RL. The diverse environments, such as Minigrid, reinforce the reliability of their conclusions. Additionally, the detailed methods for data collection and analysis promote reproducibility.

3. **Clarification of Representation versus Informational Content:** A key contribution of the paper is its insight that the performance benefits of discrete representations may arise from their structural properties, such as one-hot encoding, instead of just their discrete nature. This finding challenges existing beliefs in the literature and encourages further exploration of how different representations influence learning in various RL situations.

4. **Insights on Continual Learning:** The paper addresses the increasingly important topic of continual learning within RL frameworks, demonstrating how discrete representations can facilitate quicker adaptation in agents. This is especially relevant considering real-world applications often involve evolving environments.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Narrow Examination of Alternative Discrete Representations:** Although the focus has been on VQ-V AEs and one-hot encoding, a broader investigation into other types of discrete representations or encoding techniques would enhance the study. Including a wider variety of methods might provide additional insights into their effectiveness across different RL contexts.

2. **Interpretability of Results:** While the results indicate clear patterns, some insights—especially regarding the balance between initial learning speed and performance in dynamic contexts—might benefit from a more thorough exploration or discussion. Diving deeper into why specific representations offer quicker adaptation or better performance would be valuable for both practitioners and researchers.

3. **Scalability Issues:** The paper discusses the advantages of discrete representations in smaller settings, but it should also consider how these findings could be applied to more complex real-world scenarios. Addressing potential limitations or challenges associated with extending these approaches to larger, more complicated environments would enhance the study's relevance, especially in continual RL, where scalability is critical.

4. **Presentation Clarity:** The paper tends to be dense, and certain parts could use clearer explanations, particularly regarding the technical aspects of the methodologies or the significance of specific experiments. Making the content more accessible to non-specialist readers by simplifying explanations and clarifying central arguments would be beneficial.

**Conclusion:**

In summary, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the reinforcement learning field by emphasizing the significance of representation in continual learning environments. Its empirical results support its claims and indicate important implications for the future design of RL agents. Addressing the mentioned weaknesses—particularly by clarifying findings' implications and exploring alternative discrete representations—would bolster the paper's overall impact. The research has the potential to guide future work in representation learning and continual reinforcement learning and is recommended for presentation at ICLR 2024.
