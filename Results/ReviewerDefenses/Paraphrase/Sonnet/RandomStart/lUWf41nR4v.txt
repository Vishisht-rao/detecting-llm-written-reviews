**Review of "Addressing Long-Horizon Tasks by Integrating Program Synthesis and State Machines"**

This paper investigates an important challenge within reinforcement learning (RL)—successfully managing long-horizon tasks, which is particularly relevant for real-world scenarios where agents need to demonstrate complex behaviors over prolonged durations. The authors introduce the Program Machine Policies (POMPs) framework, which merges program synthesis with state machine representations to improve both interpretability and scalability in RL systems.

### Strengths

1. **Original Concept**: The combination of program synthesis and state machine policies represents a fresh contribution. This blend facilitates a high-level representation of skills through executable programs, and the use of state machines allows for capturing transitions between these skills, effectively addressing the long-horizon challenges that standard techniques often find difficult.

2. **Thorough Evaluation**: The experimental framework is solid, featuring a well-defined set of tasks within the Karel domain that includes both established benchmarks and newly developed long-horizon tasks. The comparison to various leading methodologies offers a thorough understanding of POMP's capabilities.

3. **Inductive Generalization**: The findings showing that POMP can extend to longer horizons without requiring fine-tuning are impressive, indicating that the framework has significant potential for situations where adaptability and durability over time are essential.

4. **Clarity and Interpretability**: The authors clearly explain the advantages of employing programs as modes within the state machine, underscoring that these programs are comprehensible to humans, thus enhancing the interpretability of the learned policies—a key concern in AI applications.

5. **Informative Ablation Studies**: The presence of ablation studies is praiseworthy, as they shed light on the effectiveness of each component within the proposed approach, validating the importance of the search algorithm for program retrieval and the need for compatibility among modes.

### Weaknesses

1. **Implementation Complexity**: Although the framework is appealing in theory, the specifics of implementation may present challenges for replication by others in the field, particularly concerning the integration of various subsystems (such as embedding space construction, program retrieval, and transition function learning). Providing greater clarity on the integration process could be useful.

2. **Scalability Concerns**: The paper shows considerable improvements on the Karel tasks but it would be informative to evaluate how well POMP performs in more complex environments, potentially involving higher-dimensional scenarios or more complicated task dynamics that go beyond those currently tested.

3. **Limited Interaction with Related Work**: The paper references several relevant studies but could delve deeper into the complexities of existing methodologies. Comparative discussions of the decisions made in this paper versus those in hierarchical RL or established programmatic RL approaches would enrich the understanding of its contributions.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**: While the paper reports mean rewards across tasks, including additional metrics, such as sample efficiency, stability, or task completion rates, would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the framework's performance.

5. **Risk of Overfitting in Long-Horizon Tasks**: Given the intricacies linked to long-horizon tasks and the deployment of multiple skills, there is a valid concern regarding the potential for overfitting to the training tasks. An evaluation of the resilience of the learned policies to variations in task configurations could strengthen the paper’s contributions.

### Conclusion

In summary, "Addressing Long-Horizon Tasks by Integrating Program Synthesis and State Machines" offers a significant advancement in the field of reinforcement learning. It introduces a well-researched framework that effectively merges programmatic techniques with state machine representations to confront the challenges presented by long-horizon tasks. The results show promise for real-world applications where human interpretability and adaptability are important. Addressing the noted weaknesses could improve the robustness of the findings and the applicability of the framework across various contexts. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to enhance clarity and engagement with existing research.
