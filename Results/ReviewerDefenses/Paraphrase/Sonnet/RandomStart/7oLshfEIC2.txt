**Review of "TimeMixer: Decomposable Multiscale Mixing for Time Series Forecasting"**

This paper investigates an essential aspect of time series forecasting by presenting a new architecture called TimeMixer, which focuses on untangling intricate temporal variations through a multiscale mixing technique. Given the rising complexity and non-stationarity of real-world data in this field, the contributions of this research are both timely and pertinent.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Concept**: The innovative multiscale mixing methodology, which distinguishes between fine-scale and coarse-scale representations, is both intuitive and well-supported. By utilizing Past-Decomposable-Mixing (PDM) and Future-Multipredictor-Mixing (FMM), the authors effectively tackle forecasting challenges that existing methods do not adequately address.

2. **Robust Empirical Results**: The thorough evaluation shows that TimeMixer performs at the forefront of both long-term and short-term forecasting benchmarks. It consistently surpasses other leading models like PatchTST and SCINet based on several metrics, showcasing its reliability and robustness.

3. **Detailed Analysis**: The authors offer an in-depth examination of various components and conduct comprehensive ablation studies to confirm the effectiveness of their proposed architecture. This adds credibility to the importance of each part of the TimeMixer framework.

4. **Transparency and Reproducibility**: The supplementary materials contain extensive information regarding datasets, model setups, and the codebase, which is essential for replicating the results. This focus on transparency is commendable and enhances the value of the research.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Model Complexity**: Despite the intriguing design principles, the complexity arising from the dual mixing mechanism (PDM and FMM) might complicate interpretation. Including a discussion about the trade-offs between model complexity and forecasting clarity, especially for practitioners aiming to implement such models, would strengthen the paper.

2. **Scalability Considerations**: Although the authors provide analyses on efficiency regarding GPU memory and processing time, there could be more focus on scalability. Given that real-world applications often deal with large datasets, a detailed examination of possible computational or memory bottlenecks with larger time series would offer valuable insights.

3. **Suggestions for Future Work**: While the paper briefly hints at future improvements related to alternative designs, a more extensive exploration of how these could be addressed would add depth. Investigating ensemble methods, variations in decomposition strategies, or different architectural approaches could enhance the model's versatility.

4. **Comparative Analysis with Recent Innovations**: While TimeMixer is compared to an adequate selection of baseline models, it would be beneficial to also evaluate how this approach compares against more recent advancements specifically designed for temporal patterns in time series, including hybrid models that integrate MLP, CNN, and attention mechanisms.

**Conclusion:**

In summary, "TimeMixer: Decomposable Multiscale Mixing for Time Series Forecasting" presents a valuable advancement in the domain of time series forecasting. The innovative framework and strong results underscore the potential of the TimeMixer architecture. To further elevate its impact, the paper should address issues of scalability, model complexity, and offer a thorough engagement with current research trends.
