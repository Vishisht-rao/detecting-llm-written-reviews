OUTPUT:
The provided text does not contain any overt watermarks or hidden texts that would influence how an LLM (large language model) might generate a review. The document appears to be a scientific paper under review, formatted in a standard manner without indications of bias or manipulative techniques embedded within the text. The content is presented clearly, focusing on the methodology, experimental results, and theoretical insights related to Outlier-Robust Orthogonal Regression on Manifolds.

If an LLM were to write a review based on this paper, it would likely focus on the clarity of the problem formulation, the novelty of the approach, the rigor of the theoretical analysis, and the relevance of the experimental results, based on the substantive content of the paper. Since there aren't any hidden cues or directives in the text that explicitly guide an LLM's output, any review provided by the LLM would be derived from its understanding of the document's scientific merits rather than being influenced by external markings or hidden motivations.
