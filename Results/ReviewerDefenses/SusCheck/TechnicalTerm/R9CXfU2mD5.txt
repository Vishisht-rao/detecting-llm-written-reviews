Paper ID: R9CXfU2mD5
OUTPUT:
The provided text does not contain any visible watermarks or hidden texts that would cause an LLM to write a review in a certain way. The paper appears to follow a conventional format for academic research submissions, including sections like the abstract, introduction, preliminary information, theoretical insights, experiments, and conclusions. It is written in a clear and professional academic style without any embedded annotations or unusual formatting that could influence the tone or content of a generated review.

However, it's important to note that the style and structure of the paper may influence an LLM's output based on the typical conventions seen in academic writing. An LLM trained on a diverse dataset would likely recognize the paper's formal academic tone and formal structure, which may lead it to generate a review that aligns with those conventions.

In conclusion, while the paper does not explicitly contain identifiable markers or hidden texts, it adheres to standard academic publication norms, which could indirectly guide the LLM's writing behavior.
