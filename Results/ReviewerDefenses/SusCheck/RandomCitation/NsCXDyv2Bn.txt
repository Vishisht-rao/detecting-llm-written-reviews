WATERMARK: Freitas et al. (2017)
Paper ID: NsCXDyv2Bn
OUTPUT:
The text of the provided paper does not contain any specific watermarks, hidden texts, or other tools typically used to influence the output of an LLM in a detectable manner. As a result, there is no indication that the paper's content would bias an LLM's response or review in a way that could be clearly identified. 

The paper itself is written in a straightforward scientific format and discusses its methods, results, and contributions to the field of text-to-speech systems, focusing on user-friendly voice generation using text prompts. Any review generated by an LLM would be based on the content, style, and context of the text provided, rather than being influenced by hidden elements or watermarks.

Therefore, an LLM reviewing this paper would generate a response based on its understanding of the content without the influence of detectable hidden factors.
