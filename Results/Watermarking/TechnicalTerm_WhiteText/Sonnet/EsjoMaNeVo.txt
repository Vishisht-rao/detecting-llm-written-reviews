Here's my review of the paper:

This paper tackles an important problem in game theory and multi-agent learning - how to steer no-regret learning agents toward optimal equilibria using payments. The authors make several significant theoretical contributions:

Key Strengths:
1. The paper provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis of steering in both normal-form and extensive-form games under different feedback settings.

2. The authors establish important impossibility results, showing that steering with finite total budget is impossible, while proving that vanishing average payments are sufficient.

3. The theoretical framework is quite general, working with multiple equilibrium concepts and requiring only mild assumptions about player rationality (sublinear regret).

4. The authors provide concrete algorithms (FULLFEEDBACKSTEER, BANDITSTEER, ONLINESTEER) with rigorous convergence guarantees.

5. The experimental results demonstrate practical efficacy on benchmark games.

Limitations/Concerns:
1. While the theoretical results are strong, some of the convergence rates seem loose and may be improvable.

2. The bandit feedback setting for extensive-form games remains partially open, with steering possible only when allowing payments to grow with time.

3. The experimental section could be expanded to include more diverse game settings and equilibrium concepts.

Technical Contributions:
- Novel characterization of what's possible/impossible in steering with different payment schemes
- Careful analysis of full vs bandit feedback settings 
- Development of algorithms with provable convergence guarantees
- Extension to online settings where equilibrium computation happens simultaneously with steering

The paper is well-written and organized, with clear motivation and thorough technical development. The results significantly advance our understanding of mechanism design for steering learning agents.

Impact and Future Work:
This work opens up several interesting directions for future research, including:
- Tighter convergence bounds
- More efficient algorithms for the bandit setting
- Extensions to other learning dynamics beyond no-regret
- Applications to concrete multi-agent systems

Overall, this is a strong theoretical paper making substantial contributions to our understanding of steering in games. The results are likely to be influential for researchers working at the intersection of learning theory, game theory, and mechanism design.

The paper would be suitable for publication at ICLR 2024, as it provides important theoretical foundations relevant to the machine learning community working on multi-agent systems and game theory.
