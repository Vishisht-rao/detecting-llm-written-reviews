OUTPUT:
The paper titled "Test Time Adaptation with Auxiliary Tasks" presents a compelling approach to addressing the challenges faced by existing Test Time Adaptation (TTA) methods, particularly in scenarios where data is limited. The authors emphasize two key scenarios where traditional TTA methods struggle: the constraints imposed by the data stream bandwidth and situations where data availability is inherently sparse.

The paper contributes to the field by introducing the DISTA (Distillation-based TTA) method, which leverages an auxiliary task during adaptation. The primary innovation lies in distilling the predictions from a pretrained model on clean data during the adaptation process. The authors demonstrate that this approach results in significant performance improvements, showing enhancements over state-of-the-art methods by 1.5% and 6% on average across various corruptions in ImageNet-C under episodic and continual evaluation, respectively.

The structure of the paper is well-organized. The introduction clearly lays out the problem and presents the motivation for the proposed solution. The methodology section provides a thorough explanation of the adaptation process, including the mathematical formulations governing the proposed DISTA method. The analysis of the auxiliary taskâ€™s effectiveness through lookahead analysis is a strong point, as it provides a quantitative measure of the model's improved performance. 

The experimental evaluation is robust, comprising a wide range of benchmarks including ImageNet-C and ImageNet-3DCC. The authors provide comprehensive results across different models and conditions, which effectively illustrate the advantages of DISTA. The use of various architectures, such as ResNet and Vision Transformers, lends further credence to the generalizability of their approach. 

However, the paper does not thoroughly discuss the computational and memory overhead associated with implementing DISTA. While the authors acknowledge the added memory burden, the implications of this trade-off could be explored more deeply, particularly in real-world applications where resource constraints are a critical factor.

The paper also presents a comparative analysis with traditional TTA methods, affirming the performance gains and offering a broad evaluation under different conditions which enhances the credibility of the claims. 

In terms of clarity and readability, the paper is generally well-written. Technical details and formulations are largely coherently presented. However, some sections could benefit from further simplification to aid reader comprehension, especially for those less familiar with the specific algorithms discussed.

Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of Test Time Adaptation by introducing a novel method that effectively utilizes auxiliary tasks to enhance model performance under distribution shifts. The results are promising, warranting further investigation into the full potential of DISTA in diverse applications. The inclusion of terms such as "compositional" highlights the need for comprehensive definitions in future revisions, ensuring clarity for all readers. 

In conclusion, this work demonstrates a solid foundation for further research into auxiliary tasks for adaptation in scenarios with limited data, making it a valuable addition to the conference proceedings.
