OUTPUT:
Here's my review of the paper "Learning Abstract World Models for Value-Preserving Planning with Options":

This paper presents a novel approach for learning abstract world models that enable efficient planning with temporally-extended actions (options) while preserving value functions. The key contributions include:

Strengths:
1. Strong theoretical foundation - The paper provides rigorous mathematical formalization of dynamics-preserving abstractions and proves bounds on value loss when planning with the learned abstract models.

2. Novel methodology - The authors introduce an information maximization approach compatible with modern deep learning techniques that learns continuous abstract state representations, going beyond previous work that was limited to discrete abstractions.

3. Practical validation - The experimental results on challenging domains (Pinball from pixels and MuJoCo Ant maze navigation) demonstrate that the learned abstract models enable more sample-efficient planning compared to baseline approaches.

4. Clear connection to prior work - The paper effectively builds on and generalizes previous frameworks like Skills to Symbols and "variational bayes" approaches while addressing their limitations.

Weaknesses:
1. Limited empirical evaluation - While the results are promising, testing on only two domains feels somewhat limited. Additional experiments on a broader range of environments would strengthen the empirical validation.

2. Complexity of implementation - The mutual information optimization approach involves several components and loss terms that may make practical implementation challenging. More implementation details would be helpful.

3. Options are assumed given - The method assumes access to a set of pre-trained options rather than learning them jointly with the abstract model. Investigating joint learning could be valuable future work.

Impact and Significance:
This work makes important theoretical and practical contributions to hierarchical reinforcement learning and planning. The principled approach to learning continuous abstract models that preserve planning value could enable more efficient learning of complex long-horizon tasks. The information theoretic framework also provides theoretical justification for recent successful representation learning approaches.

Overall, this is a strong paper that advances our understanding of abstraction learning for hierarchical planning and reinforcement learning. The theoretical results are solid and the experimental validation, while limited in scope, demonstrates clear benefits of the approach.

Rating: Accept

The paper would benefit from more extensive empirical evaluation and implementation details, but the core contributions are significant and well-supported by both theory and the existing results.
