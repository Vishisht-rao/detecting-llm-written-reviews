The paper titled "Depth-Guided Self-Supervised Learning: Seeing the World in 3D" presents a novel approach to improving self-supervised learning (SSL) by incorporating depth information into the representation learning process. The authors argue for the importance of depth cues, informed by biological vision systems, to enhance the performance of SSL methods, especially in terms of robustness to corrupted images. They propose two main approaches: appending depth information to RGB inputs and generating augmented 3D views from depth estimates.

The introduction effectively establishes the motivation for the research, highlighting the contrast between biological vision and existing machine learning techniques. The paper is well-structured, with a clear delineation of methods and experimental setups. The authors provide a comprehensive overview of relevant related work, which helps situate their contributions within the broader context of SSL and depth utilization.

The proposed methods are interesting: the first involves adding a depth channel to RGB images, and the second leverages a state-of-the-art method for synthesizing novel views from depth information, which they utilize as augmentations in the SSL framework. The experimental results are promising, showing that both methods lead to improved accuracy on several datasets (ImageNette, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1k) and demonstrate enhanced robustness against image corruptions. Notably, the combination of both approaches yields the best results, suggesting that they complement each other effectively.

The paper emphasizes depth cues' role in SSL and the ability to leverage pretrained models for depth estimation, which adds practical significance to the approach. The concept of "hyperspherical embedding" mentioned in the paper could have been further explored to elucidate potential connections to existing techniques.

One area for improvement may be clearer explanation and justification for certain methodological choices, such as the rationale behind depth dropout and its impact on training dynamics. Additionally, a deeper exploration of the computational costs associated with the depth estimation process during training and inference could enhance the reader's understanding of the practical implications of the proposed methods.

In conclusion, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of self-supervised learning by integrating depth information to improve representation learning. The experimental results demonstrate the potential benefits and robustness of the proposed methods, providing a valuable direction for future research and applications in visual representation learning.
