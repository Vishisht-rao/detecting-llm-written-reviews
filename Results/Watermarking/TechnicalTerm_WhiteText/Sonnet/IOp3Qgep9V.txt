Here's my review of the paper:

This paper addresses an important and timely problem in deep learning - investigating and improving the adversarial robustness of dataset condensation methods. The authors make several notable contributions:

1. They empirically demonstrate that existing dataset condensation methods do not inherently provide adversarial robustness, challenging an intuitive assumption in the field.

2. They provide theoretical analysis linking adversarial robustness to the curvature of the loss landscape, establishing bounds on robustness for condensed datasets.

3. They propose GUARD, a novel method that incorporates curvature regularization into the condensation process to generate more robust synthetic datasets.

Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written
- The theoretical analysis is sound and provides good insights into why current methods lack robustness
- The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, testing across multiple datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10) and attack types
- The proposed GUARD method shows consistent improvements over existing approaches while maintaining comparable clean accuracy
- The authors demonstrate the transferability of their approach to other condensation methods

Weaknesses:
- The paper could benefit from more analysis of computational overhead introduced by the curvature regularization
- While results are shown for MNIST and CIFAR10, testing on more complex datasets would strengthen the findings
- The theoretical analysis makes some assumptions that could be discussed in more detail
- The "spillover effects" between clean accuracy and robustness could be analyzed more thoroughly

The experimental results are convincing, showing that GUARD consistently outperforms baseline methods across different attack settings. For instance, on CIFAR10 with 10 images per class, GUARD achieves 23.5% accuracy under ℓ∞ attacks compared to 18.8% for the next best method.

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes meaningful contributions to both the theoretical understanding and practical improvement of dataset condensation methods. The work opens up interesting directions for future research in robust dataset condensation.

Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions to address the computational complexity analysis and expand the experimental evaluation where possible.
