OUTPUT:
The paper presented by Aleksei Ustimenko and Aleksandr Beznosikov investigates a unified framework for analyzing a broad class of Markov chains, specifically Ito chains, and establishes guarantees on their diffusion approximations. This work addresses an important and timely topic within the fields of stochastic processes, optimization, and sampling, which is particularly relevant given the rising interest in non-Gaussian noise and varied assumptions related to stochastic gradient dynamics.

The authors successfully extend existing theories by considering a more general setup that accommodates isotropic, state-dependent noise as well as non-normal distributions. The paper introduces an Ito chain model that incorporates key features from stochastic methods used in stochastic optimization, sampling, and gradient boosting. This aspect highlights the relevance of their findings to practical applications in machine learning and statistical inference.

The main contribution of the paper is the provision of a bound in the Wasserstein distance (W2-distance) between the laws of the proposed Ito chain and the corresponding stochastic differential equation. The authors present their theoretical results with clarity, emphasizing how their bounds improve or cover existing estimates found in the literature. Notably, they claim that their results are pioneering in several cases, particularly when considering non-Gaussian noise.

The paper does an adequate job of delineating the connections and contrasts with prior works, particularly with established methodologies involving Langevin dynamics in stochastic processes. The extensive discussion of related works, supported by tables that summarize findings across various models, provides valuable context for understanding how this paper fits within the existing theoretical landscape.

However, the paper could benefit from a more thorough explanation of the implications of its findings, particularly regarding how the theoretical bounds translate into practical applications of the Ito chains in real-world scenarios. Also, while the authors provide compelling results, including a new version of the Girsanov theorem adapted for their context, the lengthy and complex nature of the proofs may deter readers without a strong background in stochastic calculus.

Moreover, it would be informative to see how these theoretical advancements translate into algorithmic developments or improvements in practical implementations, perhaps through numerical experiments or case studies which are notably lacking.

Overall, this paper presents a significant step forward in understanding the behavior of Ito chains in the context of diffusion approximation, showcasing the potential for broader applicability in fields like optimization and machine learning. The findings are solid, innovative, and relevant; additional insights into practical applications would elevate the paper further.
