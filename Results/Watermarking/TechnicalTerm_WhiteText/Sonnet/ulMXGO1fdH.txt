The paper titled "Estimating Post-Synaptic Effects for Online Training of Feed-Forward SNNs" presents a novel approach to online learning in spiking neural networks (SNNs). The authors introduce Online Training with Postsynaptic Estimates (OTPE), which aims to improve the scalability and effectiveness of online learning systems for SNNs, particularly in environments where real-time learning from continuous data streams is crucial.

The paper begins by outlining the challenges faced in training SNNs, particularly the limitations of backpropagation through time (BPTT) and real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) due to their computational complexity. The authors detail existing approximation methods like Online Training Through Time (OTTT) and Online Spatio-Temporal Learning (OSTL) and identify their shortcomings, particularly concerning the temporal dynamics that impact gradient calculations. The proposed OTPE seeks to address these gaps by providing a more nuanced approximation of temporal effects, thereby enhancing learning performance without significantly increasing computational overhead.

The authors systematically evaluate OTPE against existing algorithms, reporting improved alignment with exact gradients calculated via BPTT. The paper includes extensive experimental results across various datasets, including the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) and synthetic Randman datasets, showcasing OTPE's robustness in both online and offline learning scenarios. Notably, the reported results indicate that OTPE achieves superior performance metrics compared to existing methods while maintaining comparable scalability, reinforcing the practicality of the approach.

One of the strengths of the paper is its thorough methodological background, providing sufficient context for understanding the evolution of training strategies in SNNs. The choice of metrics, such as gradient alignment and validation accuracy, is appropriate for the claims made regarding OTPE's effectiveness. Additionally, the paper successfully communicates the technical advancements and their implications for deep learning systems that require adaptability to temporal data streams.

However, there are some areas in which the manuscript could be improved. Firstly, while the introduction effectively establishes the relevance of the work, a clearer articulation of the broader impact of OTPE within the field of neuromorphic computing could enhance the reader's understanding. Furthermore, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of potential limitations and future work, particularly concerning the application of OTPE in larger and more complex networks or real-world applications with varying data distributions. Lastly, although the paper mentions "global-content orchestration" as part of the discussion, it does not adequately explain this term or its relevance to the proposed method, which may leave readers unfamiliar with this terminology confused.

In conclusion, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of SNNs and online learning, with OTPE's design offering promising directions for future research in energy-efficient machine intelligence. The results are compelling and suggest that OTPE could become a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners working with event-based learning systems. Overall, the paper is well-organized and delivers its findings effectively, despite some minor shortcomings in elaborating on broader implications and terminology.
