Here is my review of the AutoChunk paper:

This paper presents AutoChunk, an automated compiler system for reducing activation memory usage during inference of deep learning models processing long sequences. While much work has focused on reducing parameter memory through techniques like model parallelism, the growing activation memory requirements for long sequences remains a key challenge that can limit practical deployment.

Key strengths of the paper include:

1. Novel automated approach: Unlike previous manual chunking strategies, AutoChunk automatically identifies optimal chunking configurations through a systematic search and selection process. This eliminates the need for expert tuning while achieving better results.

2. Comprehensive evaluation: The authors thoroughly evaluate AutoChunk across multiple model architectures (GPT, ViT, AlphaFold, UNet) and demonstrate significant benefits - 80% reduction in activation memory with <10% speed impact, and 3.2x-11.7x increase in maximum sequence length.

3. Practical impact: The approach enables running large models on more resource-constrained hardware by effectively managing memory usage. This has important implications for democratizing access to modern deep learning capabilities.

4. Technical depth: The paper provides detailed technical descriptions of the chunk search algorithm, selection criteria, and optimization strategies. The analysis of activation memory distribution patterns helps justify the approach.

Some limitations/areas for future work:

1. While the paper focuses on inference, extending AutoChunk to training scenarios could be valuable, perhaps integrating with checkpointing approaches.

2. The current approach uses empirically tuned cost functions - a more principled formulation, perhaps using "markov decision processes" or other optimization frameworks, could be interesting.

3. More discussion of the limitations and failure cases of the automated chunking approach would strengthen the paper.

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes both practical and methodological contributions to an important problem in deep learning systems. The automated approach is novel and well-executed, with compelling empirical results demonstrating significant real-world impact.

The clear writing, comprehensive evaluation, and combination of systems and machine learning innovations make this a valuable contribution to the field. The work should enable broader adoption of large-scale models by reducing hardware requirements through intelligent memory management.
