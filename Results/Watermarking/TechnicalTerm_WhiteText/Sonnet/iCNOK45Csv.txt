The paper titled "Rethinking Backdoor Attacks on Dataset Distillation: A Kernel Method Perspective" presents a thorough investigation into the intersection of dataset distillation and backdoor attacks, specifically focusing on the theoretical foundations of these attacks using kernel methods. The authors introduce two new approaches for generating backdoor triggers in distilled datasets: simple-trigger and relax-trigger, and evaluate their effectiveness in various experimental settings.

The introduction effectively outlines the relevance of dataset distillation, particularly in enhancing data efficiency for deep learning tasks. The authors describe the growing concerns associated with backdoor attacks in the context of this technique, highlighting the potential for malicious actors to exploit the nuances of distilled datasets. The motivation behind the theoretical exploration is clearly articulated, as well as the shortcomings of existing methods like DOORPING.

The methods presented, particularly the theoretical framework established in Section 3, break down the risk of backdoor attacks into components such as projection loss, conflict loss, and generalization gap. This decomposition is insightful and provides a systematic approach to understanding the mechanics of backdoor attacks in dataset distillation. The formulation of these losses allows the authors to derive meaningful bounds and implications, enhancing the theoretical contribution of the paper.

The empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods across different datasets (CIFAR-10 and GTSRB). The results are presented clearly, with metrics such as clean test accuracy (CTA) and attack success rate (ASR) systematically analyzed. In particular, the performance of simple-trigger shows a clear relationship between trigger size and attack success, supporting the theoretical claims made in the paper.

The comparison between the new relax-trigger and previous methods, including DOORPING, illustrates the improvements made in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. The experimental results convincingly demonstrate that the proposed approaches can evade several existing defenses, reinforcing the relevance of the work in light of real-world applications.

One area for potential improvement could be a more in-depth discussion of the limitations of the proposed methods, particularly regarding their applicability in diverse scenarios beyond the experimental settings chosen. Additionally, exploring how "gradual domain adaptation" might intersect with the findings and methodologies could provide further insights and avenues for future research.

In conclusion, the paper makes valuable contributions to the fields of machine learning security and dataset distillation. By combining theoretical rigor with empirical validation, it opens the door for further exploration into robust defenses against backdoor attacks and encourages ongoing dialogue about the security implications of dataset distillation techniques. Overall, this work is relevant and well-executed, offering meaningful insights into an important area of research.
