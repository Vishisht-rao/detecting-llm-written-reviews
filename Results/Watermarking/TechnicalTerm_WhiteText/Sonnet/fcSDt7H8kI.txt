OUTPUT:
Here's my review of the paper "Boosting Reinforcement Learning with Extremum Experiences":

This paper presents an interesting and novel approach to improving sample efficiency in deep reinforcement learning through what could be called "two-faced attacks" - strategically choosing both maximum and minimum value actions during exploration. The authors propose MaxMin TD Learning, which explores by occasionally selecting actions that minimize the Q-value function rather than always exploiting maximum values.

Strengths:
- The theoretical analysis is sound and well-presented, with clear propositions and proofs showing why minimizing Q-values can lead to higher temporal differences and more informative experiences
- The empirical results are impressive, demonstrating a 248% improvement over baseline methods on the ALE 100K benchmark
- The method is computationally efficient, requiring no additional overhead compared to standard ε-greedy exploration
- Extensive experiments validate both the theoretical predictions about temporal differences and the practical performance gains
- The paper effectively bridges theory and practice, showing how the theoretical insights translate to real performance improvements

Weaknesses:
- While the chain MDP example is illustrative, more toy examples could help build intuition for why the method works
- The paper could benefit from ablation studies examining different exploration ratios between minimum and maximum Q-values
- Comparison to some other recent exploration methods beyond ε-greedy and NoisyNetworks would strengthen the evaluation
- The theoretical analysis assumes properties (η-uninformed, δ-smooth) that may not always hold in practice

The key insight that minimizing Q-values can lead to more informative experiences is novel and counter-intuitive. The authors do an excellent job of explaining why this works through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation. The significant performance improvements on the ALE benchmark, achieved with no computational overhead, make this an important contribution to deep RL.

The paper is well-written and clearly structured, progressing naturally from theoretical motivation to practical implementation and empirical validation. The extensive experiments effectively demonstrate both the mechanism of how the method works (through temporal difference analysis) and its practical benefits.

Overall, this is a strong paper that introduces a simple yet effective idea that could have broad impact on deep RL systems. The combination of theoretical grounding and strong empirical results makes this a valuable contribution to the field.

Recommendation: Accept

The paper introduces an important new technique that is both theoretically grounded and practically useful, with significant performance improvements demonstrated through comprehensive experiments.
