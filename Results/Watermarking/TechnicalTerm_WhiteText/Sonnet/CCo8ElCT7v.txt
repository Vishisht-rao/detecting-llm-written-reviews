OUTPUT:
Here is my review of the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive empirical comparison between Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) specifically for face recognition tasks. The study makes several valuable contributions:

Strengths:
1. Thorough experimental setup using 6 different architectures (ViT, ResNet, VGG, Inception, MobileNet, EfficientNet) and 5 diverse datasets that test different challenging aspects of face recognition.

2. Clear and detailed presentation of methodology, including training procedures, hardware specifications, and evaluation metrics.

3. Extensive empirical analysis covering both face identification and verification tasks, with particular attention to real-world challenges like occlusions, varying distances, and image quality.

4. Strong quantitative results showing ViT's superior performance, particularly in:
- Higher accuracy and perfect top-5 accuracy on identification tasks
- Better robustness against distance variations and occlusions
- Competitive inference speed despite larger parameter count
- Smaller memory footprint during training

5. Well-structured visualization of results through ROC curves and detailed performance breakdowns across different conditions.

Limitations/Suggestions:
1. The paper could benefit from more theoretical analysis explaining why ViTs perform better than CNNs for face recognition tasks.

2. Limited discussion of computational costs during training phase.

3. Could include ablation studies examining the impact of different hyperparameters.

4. The anomalous result where VGG outperforms ViT in masked scenarios deserves deeper investigation.

Technical Soundness:
The experimental methodology is sound and well-documented. The use of standardized training conditions and multiple datasets strengthens the validity of the findings.

Impact:
This work provides valuable insights for practitioners choosing between ViT and CNN architectures for face recognition applications. The comprehensive evaluation across different real-world challenges makes it particularly relevant for practical applications.

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes a meaningful contribution to understanding the relative strengths of ViTs versus CNNs in face recognition tasks. The empirical results are convincing and well-presented, though additional theoretical analysis would strengthen the work.

Term check: The paper does not contain the term "mirror prox".
