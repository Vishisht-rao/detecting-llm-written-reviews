OUTPUT:
The submitted paper presents a notable advancement in the area of Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) completion, particularly addressing the challenges associated with incremental learning and the handling of long-tail entities. The authors propose a framework that integrates a model-agnostic enhancement layer and a weighted sampling strategy to improve the performance of TKG completion models under incremental training conditions.

The motivation behind the work is well-articulated, emphasizing the need for TKGs to maintain performance when new entities and relationships emerge over time. By acknowledging the limitations of traditional approaches that rely heavily on dense connections within local neighborhoods, the authors effectively highlight the importance of integrating a broader definition of entity similarity. This shift towards a global perspective on similarity could enhance the robustness and adaptability of TKG completion methods, a point that is supported by empirical results.

The methodology is clearly defined, with a strong focus on developing a framework that can be applied across various existing TKG completion models. The introduction of the enhancement layer, designed to enrich the representation of entities with limited local connections, represents a significant contribution to the field. Additionally, the weighted sampling strategy addresses the common bias towards frequently occurring entities, thus improving the model's ability to generalize to rare or unseen entities.

The experimental setup is comprehensive, employing two benchmark datasets (ICEWS14 and ICEWS18) to validate the proposed framework. The authors provide thorough evaluations across different scenarios, including overall link prediction, inductive link prediction, and performance regarding long-tail entities. The reported improvements in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of up to 15% are compelling and lend credence to the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Furthermore, the paper effectively situates its contributions within the existing literature by discussing related works in temporal knowledge graph completion and continual learning. The references to past efforts highlight the novelty of the approach while acknowledging prior advancements, which enhances the reader's understanding of the context.

The ablation study further strengthens the manuscript, illustrating the individual contributions of the enhancement layer and weighted sampling strategy. This section effectively demonstrates how these components work together to improve performance, particularly concerning catastrophic forgetting and the handling of sparsely connected entities.

However, one area for improvement could be the discussion of the computational complexity of the proposed methods. While the authors briefly mention time and memory complexities in the appendix, a more comprehensive analysis within the main text could benefit readers in assessing the practicality of deploying the proposed model in real-world applications.

Overall, the paper addresses a significant gap in the literature surrounding TKG completion and presents a well-reasoned and experimental approach that showcases the potential for improved performance in incremental settings. The findings are likely to be relevant to researchers and practitioners working on knowledge graphs and continual learning. The contributions are substantial, and the paper is a valuable addition to the ongoing discourse in the field.
