Here's my review of the paper:

This paper explores how predictive auxiliary objectives affect representation learning in deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems and draws interesting parallels with learning mechanisms in the brain. The work makes several valuable contributions:

Strengths:

1. The study provides a systematic investigation of how predictive auxiliary objectives influence representation learning across different components of an RL system, particularly in resource-limited architectures.

2. The authors demonstrate that longer predictive horizons are more effective for transfer learning compared to shorter ones, offering practical insights for RL system design.

3. The paper makes compelling connections between artificial and biological learning systems, mapping the encoder network to visual cortex, value learning network to striatum, and predictive model to hippocampus.

4. The experimental results show how their deep RL framework can replicate various phenomena observed in neural recordings, providing a computational explanation for empirical neuroscience findings.

5. The work suggests a novel perspective on hippocampal function - as an auxiliary learning system that benefits representation learning in other brain regions.

Limitations:

1. The experiments are primarily conducted in relatively simple environments (gridworld tasks). Testing in more complex domains would strengthen the conclusions.

2. While the paper draws many parallels with biological systems, it doesn't fully address the biological plausibility of the learning algorithms used.

3. The analysis of value learning network representations (striatum analog) is somewhat limited compared to the other components.

Methodology:
The authors employ a "discrete" state space environment and use standard deep RL techniques combined with predictive auxiliary objectives. The experimental design systematically varies key parameters like latent dimensionality and predictive horizon to characterize their effects.

Impact:
This work makes important contributions to both machine learning and neuroscience. For ML, it provides insights into how auxiliary objectives shape representation learning. For neuroscience, it offers a computational framework for understanding interactions between brain regions during learning.

Overall, this is a strong paper that bridges artificial and biological learning systems in a novel and insightful way. The results have implications for both improving deep RL algorithms and understanding biological learning mechanisms.

Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions addressing the limitations noted above.

The paper would benefit from:
1. Testing on more complex environments
2. Expanded analysis of value learning network representations
3. Further discussion of biological plausibility
