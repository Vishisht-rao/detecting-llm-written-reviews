OUTPUT:
The paper presents a novel evaluation framework for large language models (LLMs) called Peer Rank and Discussion (PRD), which aims to improve the quality and fairness of automated evaluations in the context of open-ended question answering. The authors effectively identify and address significant biases in existing approaches, such as self-enhancement and positional bias, which arise when using a single LLM as the evaluator. By incorporating insights from the educational domain on peer review methodologies, the paper proposes two primary components: the Peer Rank (PR) algorithm and peer discussions (PD) among multiple LLMs.

The PR algorithm utilizes pairwise comparisons made by multiple peer LLMs, thereby mitigating individual model biases and producing a more reliable ranking of model performance. The authors demonstrate how their method can induce self-ranking among LLMs by accounting for the reviewers' strengths in weight adjustments, which is a noteworthy contribution to the field. Additionally, the peer discussion process allows two LLMs to engage in a dialogue to reach a consensus on evaluations, further enriching the review process and aligning it more closely with human judgement.

The experimental evaluation consists of comprehensive tests on benchmark datasets (LFQA and Vicuna80), showcasing improved correlation with human judgments compared to traditional methods. The results reflect the effectiveness of both PR and PD in providing fair pairwise comparisons, and the authors offer detailed analyses of their findings, including observations about the influence of reviewer strength on opinion holding during discussions.

The paper is well-structured and presents its methodologies clearly, providing sufficient details for reproducibility, which is commendable. The references cited are extensive and relevant, grounding the proposed methodologies within the existing literature. However, while the authors successfully demonstrate the capabilities of their proposed methods, additional discussions on the limitations of their approaches, as well as potential avenues for future research, would further enhance the depth of the paper.

Overall, this study adds significant value to the discourse on LLM evaluation techniques and presents a promising framework for developing more equitable and effective assessment methods in natural language processing. The findings suggest that engaging peer models in evaluations can yield fairer and more accurate model assessments in complex tasks such as open-ended question answering. Further exploration of the implications of peer evaluations in the learning processes of LLMs could also be a fruitful direction for future research.
