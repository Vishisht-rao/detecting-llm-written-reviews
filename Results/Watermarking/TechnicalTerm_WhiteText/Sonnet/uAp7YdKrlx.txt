OUTPUT:
Here is my review of the paper:

This paper presents two novel approaches for handling missing value imputation in multivariate time series data: MIM-RBFNN and MIRNN-CF. The key contributions are:

Strengths:
- The proposed MIM-RBFNN model leverages radial basis functions (RBFs) to learn local covariance structures without making explicit assumptions about the data distribution, addressing limitations of existing statistical and model-based approaches
- The MIRNN-CF extension effectively combines RBF-based continuous function generation with RNN temporal learning to handle long-term missing data
- Comprehensive empirical evaluation on multiple real-world datasets (air quality, human activity, ETT) demonstrates strong performance compared to baseline methods
- Detailed ablation studies validate the benefits of shared RBFs and time gap-based sigma initialization
- Clear mathematical formulation and algorithmic details provided in appendices

Limitations/Suggestions:
- The paper could benefit from more discussion of computational complexity and scalability considerations
- Additional baseline comparisons to other recent deep learning approaches for time series imputation would strengthen the evaluation
- The motivation for using RBFs specifically could be better explained compared to other function approximators
- Some implementation details like hyperparameter selection are not fully described

The core contributions appear novel and well-validated. The MIM-RBFNN approach offers an interesting direction for assumption-free missing value imputation by learning local covariance structures. The MIRNN-CF extension addresses key limitations around temporal dependencies.

The experimental results demonstrate meaningful improvements over both traditional statistical methods and recent deep learning approaches. The ablation studies effectively validate the key design choices. Overall, this represents a valuable contribution to the field of time series imputation.

Rating: Accept
Confidence: High

The paper makes a solid technical contribution in an important problem space, supported by strong empirical validation and analysis. The limitations noted above could be addressed in a revision but do not detract significantly from the core contributions.
