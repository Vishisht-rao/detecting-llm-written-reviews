OUTPUT:
Here's my review of the paper "Reward Translation via Reward Machine in Semi-Alignable MDPs":

This paper presents an interesting approach to reward transfer across different domains in reinforcement learning through the novel concept of semi-alignable MDPs and reward machines. The work addresses an important challenge in RL - the ability to reuse reward structures across different but related tasks, similar to how humans can abstract and transfer knowledge.

Strengths:
1. The theoretical foundation is well-developed, with clear definitions of semi-alignable MDPs and formal proofs for reward machine relationships.

2. The Neural Reward Translation (NRT) framework provides a practical implementation for transferring rewards across domains using reward machines.

3. The experimental evaluation covers diverse scenarios (NChain, Cartpole-to-HalfCheetah, HalfCheetah-to-Atari-Freeway) demonstrating both isomorphic and homomorphic reward machine applications.

4. The results show meaningful improvements in training efficiency when using transferred rewards, particularly in cases with effective injection or bijection between domains.

Weaknesses:
1. The approach appears limited when dealing with tasks lacking effective injection or bijection relationships, as acknowledged by the authors.

2. The construction of appropriate reward machines for complex tasks remains challenging and isn't fully addressed.

3. The experimental evaluation could benefit from more complex real-world scenarios beyond game environments.

4. While the paper mentions using LLMs for reward machine construction, this aspect isn't thoroughly explored in the main content.

Suggested Improvements:
1. Include more detailed analysis of failure cases to better understand the limitations.

2. Expand the evaluation to include more complex, real-world applications.

3. Provide more concrete guidelines for constructing reward machines for new tasks.

4. Further explore the role of LLMs in automating reward machine construction.

The paper makes a valuable contribution to the field by introducing a framework for more generalized reward transfer in RL. The semi-alignable MDPs concept provides a useful theoretical foundation for understanding and implementing cross-domain knowledge transfer. While there are some limitations, particularly in scenarios without clear mappings between domains, the approach shows promise for improving RL training efficiency through reward reuse.

Impact: This work could significantly influence how reward functions are designed and reused across different RL tasks, potentially reducing the engineering effort required for new applications.

Minor Note: References are well-organized and relevant to the work, though some citations could be more recent.

Verdict: Accept with minor revisions. The paper presents novel theoretical and practical contributions to the field, with clear potential for impact despite some limitations.
