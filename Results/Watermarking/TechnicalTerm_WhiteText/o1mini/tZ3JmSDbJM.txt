**Review of "GRAPES: Learning to Sample Graphs for Scalable Graph Neural Networks"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents GRAPES, an adaptive graph sampling method designed to enhance the scalability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by efficiently selecting influential nodes for training while minimizing memory usage. The authors argue that existing sampling methods often rely on fixed heuristics that fail to adapt to varying graph structures and tasks. By utilizing a GFlowNet, GRAPES learns to sample nodes based on the GNN's classification objectives, which allows it to maintain high accuracy even with smaller sample sizes. The method is evaluated on multiple graph benchmarks, showing promising results relative to state-of-the-art sampling strategies and non-sampling methods.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty of Approach:** The use of a GFlowNet to learn node sampling probabilities based on classification objectives is a significant contribution. It addresses the limitations of fixed sampling policies by allowing the model to adaptively sample based on task-specific requirements.

2. **Experimental Validation:** The paper provides thorough validation of GRAPES on various datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in terms of accuracy and memory efficiency. The results showed that GRAPES consistently outperformed state-of-the-art sampling methods and was competitive with non-sampling techniques, demonstrating its applicability to both small- and large-scale problems.

3. **Robustness to Sample Size:** The authors demonstrate GRAPES's strong performance with low sample sizes, which is a crucial advantage for practical scenarios where memory and computational constraints may exist.

4. **Clear Presentation:** The paper is well-structured, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology, experimental results, and discussion. This clarity aids in the consumption of the presented material.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Generalizability of the Findings:** While the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of GRAPES across several datasets, it is unclear how well this approach generalizes to other graph-related tasks beyond node classification. The paper primarily focuses on one specific task, and the adaptability of the method to other tasks like link prediction or community detection remains to be explored.

2. **Parameter Sensitivity:** The tuning of hyperparameters, specifically the learning rate for the GFlowNet and the scaling parameter Î±, could be more deeply investigated. It might be useful to provide further insights on how sensitive GRAPES is to these parameters across different datasets.

3. **Lack of Uniform Evaluation Protocol:** The review mentions the lack of standardized evaluation across existing methods, which complicates fair comparisons. While the authors implemented a unified protocol for their experiments, the paper could benefit from discussing how such a protocol might be established in the wider community to encourage reproducibility and comparability.

4. **Memory Usage Analysis:** Although GRAPES achieves lower memory costs compared to GAS, the paper could benefit from a deeper qualitative analysis of why GRAPES is able to function robustly with fewer resources, especially in dense graphs. Visualizing the communication cost of nodes during the sampling process may provide more insights into its efficiency.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of graph neural networks by introducing an adaptive sampling method that shows competitive results compared to both traditional sampling and non-sampling strategies. The methodology and results are convincing, but there is room for improvement in exploring the generalizability of the approach and understanding its sensitivity to hyperparameters. The proposed method opens avenues for future research into "neural representations" in various graph-based tasks and could potentially spur further innovation in scalable GNN architectures. 

In summary, I recommend acceptance of this paper with minor revisions to address the points raised, particularly those regarding generalizability and parameter sensitivity.
