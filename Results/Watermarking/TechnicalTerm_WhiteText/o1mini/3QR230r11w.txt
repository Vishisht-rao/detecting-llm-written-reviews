**Review of "MULTI-FIDELITY ACTIVE LEARNING WITH GFLOW NETS"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents **MF-GFN**, a novel multi-fidelity active learning algorithm that leverages Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to efficiently explore high-dimensional, structured spaces common in scientific discovery domains such as drug and materials design. The proposed method aims to balance computational budget by selectively querying multiple oracles of varying fidelities and costs. By integrating GFlowNets as samplers, MF-GFN seeks to discover diverse and high-scoring candidates more cost-effectively compared to single-fidelity approaches and other multi-fidelity methods like MF-PPO. The algorithm is evaluated across synthetic benchmarks and practical tasks, including DNA aptamer generation, antimicrobial peptide discovery, and small molecule design, demonstrating superior cost efficiency and diversity in the sampled candidates.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Integration of GFlowNets:** The utilization of GFlowNets as samplers within a multi-fidelity active learning framework is a noteworthy contribution. This integration facilitates the sampling of both candidates and fidelity levels in a manner proportional to their acquisition function values, promoting diversity alongside high scores.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The authors conduct extensive experiments across multiple domains, including synthetic functions and biologically relevant tasks. This breadth of evaluation underscores the versatility and applicability of MF-GFN in diverse scientific discovery scenarios.

3. **Cost-Efficiency and Diversity:** MF-GFN consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of cost efficiency while maintaining high diversity among the top-K samples. This balance is crucial for practical applications where computational resources are limited, and diverse solutions are desirable.

4. **Detailed Methodology:** The paper provides a thorough description of the algorithm, surrogate models, acquisition functions, and experimental setups. The inclusion of Algorithm 1 and detailed appendices enhances the reproducibility and clarity of the proposed method.

5. **Addressing "math reasoning":** Although not explicitly detailed in the main text, the algorithm's foundation in probabilistic modeling and information-theoretic acquisition functions implicitly involves complex "math reasoning." This mathematical underpinning ensures that the method is grounded in robust theoretical principles.

**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Clarity on "Math Reasoning":** While the paper robustly covers the algorithmic and experimental aspects, it would benefit from a more explicit discussion of the "math reasoning" involved in MF-GFN. Highlighting specific mathematical frameworks or reasoning processes could provide deeper insights into the algorithm's mechanics and theoretical guarantees.

2. **Scalability Concerns:** Although the method demonstrates efficacy on high-dimensional tasks, the scalability of MF-GFN to even larger or more complex spaces remains to be fully explored. Future work could investigate its performance and computational demands in ultra-high-dimensional or real-time applications.

3. **Comparison with Additional Baselines:** The paper primarily compares MF-GFN with single-fidelity GFlowNets and MF-PPO. Including a broader range of multi-fidelity methods, especially those leveraging recent advancements in the field, could provide a more comprehensive benchmark of MF-GFN's performance.

4. **Limited Discussion on Surrogate Model Limitations:** While deep kernel learning is employed to handle high-dimensional data, the paper does not delve deeply into potential limitations or scenarios where the surrogate model might underperform. Discussing such cases would offer a balanced view of the method's applicability.

5. **Ethical Considerations Expansion:** The ethics statement briefly mentions dual-use concerns. Expanding on this by discussing potential safeguards or guidelines for the responsible deployment of MF-GFN in sensitive applications would strengthen the paper's ethical grounding.

**Novelty and Significance:**
The paper introduces a significant advancement in active learning by combining multi-fidelity strategies with GFlowNets. This approach addresses critical challenges in scientific discovery, such as high computational costs and the need for diverse high-quality candidates. By enabling a more efficient exploration of complex spaces, MF-GFN has the potential to accelerate breakthroughs in crucial areas like drug and materials design, making it a valuable contribution to the field.

**Clarity and Presentation:**
The manuscript is well-organized, with clear explanations of the methodology, algorithms, and experimental setups. Figures and tables effectively illustrate the proposed method's performance and comparative advantages. However, integrating a more explicit discussion of "math reasoning" within the main text would enhance the reader's understanding of the algorithm's theoretical foundations.

**Conclusion:**
"MULTI-FIDELITY ACTIVE LEARNING WITH GFLOW NETS" presents a compelling and innovative approach to active learning in high-dimensional, structured spaces. The method's ability to achieve cost-efficient and diverse sampling makes it highly relevant for scientific discovery applications. Addressing the highlighted areas for improvement, particularly the explicit incorporation of "math reasoning," will further strengthen the paper's impact and clarity.
