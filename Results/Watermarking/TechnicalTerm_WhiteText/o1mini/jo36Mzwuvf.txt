### Review of “Gaussian Process-based Corruption-Resilience Forecasting Models”

#### Summary
The paper introduces a novel framework for time series forecasting that aims to improve prediction accuracy in the presence of corruption by using Gaussian Processes (GPs) for generating smoothly-correlated noise. Traditional forecasting models suffer from issues arising from uncorrelated isotropic Gaussian noise corruption, which leads to unnatural temporal patterns in predicted series. The proposed joint forecast-corrupt-denoise model separates the focus on coarse-grained behavior prediction and fine-grained behavior correction, demonstrating improved resilience against corruption. Extensive experiments illustrate the superior performance of the proposed model compared to state-of-the-art forecasting models and traditional denoising methods.

#### Strengths
1. **Innovative Approach**: The proposal to employ Gaussian Processes to create a corruption model that is temporally correlated is a significant advancement over traditional isotropic Gaussian noise. This addresses a common problem in time series forecasting and suggests a pathway to improve model robustness.
   
2. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The authors provide extensive experimental validation across multiple datasets and several state-of-the-art forecasting models, demonstrating consistent improvements in forecasting accuracy. The use of classical baselines alongside modern techniques enhances the credibility of the findings.

3. **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is well-structured, presenting a clear progression from problem formulation to methodology and results. The figures effectively illustrate the differences in corruption and denoising outcomes.

4. **Contribution to the Field**: By highlighting the limitations of isotropic Gaussian corruption, the work encourages further exploration of more nuanced corruption models in time series forecasting, potentially influencing future research directions.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Theoretical Justification**: While the empirical results show a clear advantage to using GP-based corruption, the theoretical justification of why this approach leads to improved forecasting could be strengthened. A more in-depth discussion regarding the underlying principles that govern the interaction between the forecasting and denoising components would enhance the robustness of the paper.

2. **Complexity of Implementation**: The proposed model introduces additional complexity due to the need for a GP corruption model. While the authors mention the scalability of this approach, it would be helpful to include discussions on the computational costs and the practicality of implementation, particularly in real-world scenarios.

3. **Limited Focus on Applications**: Although the societal consequences section points to potential applications, it remains somewhat vague. It would benefit from more concrete examples detailing how the improvements in forecasting accuracy can be applied to specific real-world problems, perhaps touching on “goal-conditioned policies.”

4. **Comparison with Other Denoising Techniques**: The paper references various denoising models, yet it may be beneficial to analyze why these traditional methods underperform in this context. A more comprehensive comparison of essential factors contributing to the success of the proposed approach over existing ones would provide greater insights.

#### Conclusion
Overall, the paper presents a commendable contribution to the field of time series forecasting by introducing an innovative and effective forecasting framework that emphasizes resilience against corruption. With minor improvements in theoretical backing and practical considerations, it holds strong potential for acceptance at ICLR 2024. The authors should also consider enhancing the discussions surrounding the implications of their work for real-world applications to further bolster its impact.
