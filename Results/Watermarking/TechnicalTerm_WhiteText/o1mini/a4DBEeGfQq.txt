**Review of "STRUCT COMP: SUBSTITUTING PROPAGATION WITH STRUCTURAL COMPRESSION IN TRAINING GRAPH CONTRASTIVE LEARNING"**

**Summary:**
The authors present a novel framework called Structural Compression (StructComp) aimed at addressing the scalability issues inherent in training graph contrastive learning (GCL) models. The methodology primarily replaces traditional message passing techniques with a compressed representation of nodes based on low-rank approximations. Notably, the proposed method allows for reduced computational costs while maintaining or even improving model performance. The paper includes a theoretical analysis supporting the framework and empirical evaluations across several datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in both resource efficiency and model accuracy.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Approach:** The introduction of StructComp as a substitute for traditional message-passing methods is innovative and addresses critical scalability challenges in GCL. By reducing the complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n) in terms of contrastive pair calculations, the method has the potential to make significant contributions to the field of graph representation learning.

2. **Theoretical Foundations:** The authors provide a robust theoretical foundation, proving that the loss computed from compressed nodes can approximate the original GCL loss. This theoretical grounding strengthens the validity of the proposed framework and represents a significant contribution to understanding the mechanics of GCL.

3. **Empirical Evidence:** The extensive empirical evaluations across various datasets convincingly demonstrate the advantages of StructComp over traditional GCL models, showcasing improvements in both performance and efficiency. The results indicate not only reduced computational time and memory usage but also enhancements in classification accuracy, particularly for multi-view GCL models.

4. **Versatility:** The proposed framework is shown to be adaptable for both single-view and multi-view GCL models, suggesting its broad applicability within the field. Additionally, the customization of a data augmentation method specifically for StructComp further demonstrates the adaptability and practicality of the proposed framework.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Discussion on Implementation Details:** While the paper presents promising results, there is little detail on the specific implementation challenges encountered during the experimental setup, particularly on larger datasets. More in-depth discussion regarding hyperparameter tuning and the stability of the training process could aid reproducibility.

2. **Dependence on Graph Partitioning:** The effectiveness of StructComp partially hinges on the choice and quality of the graph partitioning method used. The authors should discuss potential limitations and provide guidance on the best practices for partitioning in various contexts, along with a comparative analysis of different partitioning techniques.

3. **Broader Implications and Applications:** While the primary focus is on scalability and efficiency, the paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion of potential real-world applications and implications of using StructComp beyond just performance metrics. For example, elaborating on how this approach to "rationale generation" enhances interpretable GCL could enrich the contributions of this work.

4. **Comparative Analysis with Recent Methods:** The paper mentions comparisons with other scalable training methods but does not delve deeply into nuanced discussions of how StructComp stands against cutting-edge methods that address similar challenges. A more detailed analysis could better position StructComp within the landscape of GCL research.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper provides a solid and much-needed contribution to the field of graph contrastive learning by proposing a framework that improves scalability while maintaining model performance. StructComp is a promising approach that addresses critical pain points associated with GCL, and with some additional details on implementation and broader implications, it could further inspire future research in this domain. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to enhance clarity and discussion, particularly about the practical implications and potential limitations of the proposed framework.
