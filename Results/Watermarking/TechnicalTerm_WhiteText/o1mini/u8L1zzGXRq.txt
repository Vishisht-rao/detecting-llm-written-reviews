### Review of "IMPACT OF MOLECULAR REPRESENTATIONS ON DEEP LEARNING MODEL COMPARISONS IN DRUG RESPONSE PREDICTIONS"

#### Summary
The authors present a novel automated cross-validation framework, CoMParison work- flow for Cross Validation (CMP-CV), designed to facilitate systematic comparisons of deep learning models tasked with predicting drug responses in cancer. The paper emphasizes the critical role that molecular representations play in the predictive capacities of these models. Key contributions include benchmarking various drug representations such as molecular descriptors, fingerprints, graphs, and SMILES encodings and investigating their influence on model performance.

#### Strengths
1. **Relevance and Importance**: The study addresses a significant challenge in cancer research—predicting drug response using machine learning—and provides insights that are crucial to improving the utility of deep learning models in this context.
   
2. **Novel Methodology**: The development of the CMP-CV framework represents a substantial advance in allowing reproducible and comparable model evaluations across different datasets and molecular representations. Additionally, the automated nature reduces potential biases associated with manual model comparisons.

3. **Comprehensive Analysis**: The paper meticulously surveys existing models and molecular representation types, establishing a well-grounded basis for comparison. The systematic evaluation across various domains of molecular descriptors adds depth to the discussion.

4. **Insights from Results**: The findings that certain representations perform better in specific regions of the descriptor space are valuable. The use of detailed figures and tables enhances the clarity of results, facilitating better understanding among readers.

5. **Tool Development**: The creation of a user-friendly web application allows practitioners to intuitively explore and select models based on specific drug properties, greatly enhancing practical applicability.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Clarity and Presentation**: While the technical depth is commendable, the presentation occasionally lacks clarity. Complex terminology and dense descriptions could hinder comprehension for readers less familiar with deep learning or cheminformatics. Simplifying the language and providing clear examples would enhance accessibility.

2. **Reproducibility and Documentation**: Although the authors mention that a "dataset documentation" is provided, it would be beneficial for them to elaborate on data sources, processing methods, and model training specifics for broader reproducibility. Including comprehensive dataset documentation alongside clear instructions for using the provided code would enhance the paper's reproducibility.

3. **Statistical Validation**: More statistical rigor could be included in assessing the significance of differences in performance metrics among representations. This would strengthen claims regarding the superiority of certain methods.

4. **Specificity of Representations**: The paper identifies certain descriptors as being inadequately encoded in model representations. However, it may be useful to discuss concrete steps for enhancing the encoding of these dimensions or suggest alternative representations that could overcome current limitations.

5. **Broader Implications not Fully Explored**: The discussion could benefit from a more profound exploration of the implications of model selection based on molecular feature domains in real-world clinical applications. More explicit connections to potential treatment strategies or drug development processes could enrich the impact of the findings.

#### Conclusion
Overall, the paper presents a significant advancement in the comparison of deep learning models for drug response predictions, supported by a robust methodological framework and important findings. With refinements in clarity, reproducibility, and broader implications, this work has the potential to greatly contribute to future research in personalized cancer therapeutics and machine learning applications in pharmacology. The research team should be commended for their contributions to enhancing the understanding of molecular representations in drug response modeling.
