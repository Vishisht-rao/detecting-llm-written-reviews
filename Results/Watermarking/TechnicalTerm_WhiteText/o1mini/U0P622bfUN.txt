# Review of "Federated Generative Learning with Foundation Models"

### Summary
The authors propose a novel framework named *Federated Generative Learning (FGL)* that addresses critical challenges in federated learning (FL) by utilizing foundation generative models to synthesize informative training data based on client-generated prompts. Instead of transmitting model parameters, the framework requires clients to upload brief, tailored text prompts, which the server uses to generate synthetic training samples. The approach claims to offer improved communication efficiency, robustness against data distribution shifts, performance gains, and enhanced privacy protection.

### Review
**1. Originality and Significance:**  
The paper presents an innovative approach that shifts the paradigm in federated learning from exchanging large model parameters to sharing concise text prompts. This is a noteworthy contribution as it tackles several major challenges associated with traditional FL methods, such as high communication costs and privacy risks. By leveraging foundation generative models, the authors introduce an important axis of research linking generative modeling with federated learning, which could pave the way for further exploration in this area.

**2. Experimental Evaluation:**  
The experiments conducted in the paper are extensive and cover various datasets, including ImageNet and DomainNet, in both IID and non-IID scenarios. The results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional methods like FedAvg, with notable claims such as a 12% increase in performance during a single communication round. The comparisons against centralized training and detailed breakdowns of performance on different data distributions add robustness to the claims. However, the reliance on synthetic data generated from prompts raises questions about data diversity and potential overfitting on specific classes.

**3. Clarity and Organization:**  
The paper is well-structured and clearly written. The introduction concisely outlines the gaps in current federated learning implementations and positions FGL as a solution. Figures and tables effectively illustrate the experimental results, making it easier to grasp the performance comparisons. The sections are logically ordered, leading the reader through the background, methodology, experiments, and conclusions smoothly.

**4. Privacy Concerns:**  
The discussion around privacy is thorough, highlighting how FGL mitigates privacy risks by reducing the amount of sensitive data transmitted. However, there remains a need for critical analysis regarding potential risks associated with prompt information, especially in sensitive domains. The section on privacy analysis could benefit from a deeper exploration of the implications of using instance-level prompts, which, while beneficial for accuracy, may inadvertently expose more information.

**5. Limitations and Future Work:**  
While the authors acknowledge challenges such as the non-IID nature of data across clients and risks associated with prompt transmission, they do not provide a roadmap for addressing these issues comprehensively. Future work should explore mechanisms for ensuring data representativeness in synthetic samples and ways to enhance the generalizability of generated images in various domains without compromising user privacy.

**6. Technical Contributions:**  
The introduction of two prompt generation techniques (class-level and instance-level) is a valuable technical contribution. The distinction between these methods is well-articulated, demonstrating the potential improvements in synthesizing relevant training data. Nonetheless, a more detailed evaluation of the computational cost of generating prompts versus the benefits observed in training performance would strengthen the analysis.

### Conclusion
Overall, this paper puts forward a compelling framework that has the potential to advance the field of federated learning significantly. The work is innovative, well-presented, and the experimental validation appears solid. Addressing the highlighted concerns, particularly in privacy and limitations, while providing clear future research directions will further enhance the impact of this work. The development of Federated Generative Learning is a promising step towards efficient and privacy-preserving machine learning frameworks, and I recommend its acceptance with minor revisions focused on the issues discussed above.
