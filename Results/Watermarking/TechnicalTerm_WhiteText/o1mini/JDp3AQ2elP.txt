### Review of the Paper: "REVISITING FAMILIAR PLACES IN AN INFINITE WORLD: CONTINUING RL IN UNBOUNDED STATE SPACES"

#### Summary
The paper presents a novel approach, Stability Then OPtimality (STOP), for addressing the challenges faced by deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents when operating in unbounded state spaces without episodic resets. It identifies key difficulties such as poor credit assignment and extrapolation burdens, which can lead to divergence in these contexts. The authors propose a combination of techniques, including Lyapunov-inspired reward shaping and weight annealing, to achieve stable learning, ultimately aiming to enhance the agents' performance in real-world inspired environments, such as traffic control and queuing systems.

#### Strengths
1. **Novel Contribution**: This work offers a significant contribution to the field by focusing on the intersection of unbounded state spaces, continuous RL, and learning stability. The introduction of STOP is innovative and tackles a critical problem that has not been extensively explored in existing literature.
  
2. **Theoretical Framework**: The paper provides a well-structured theoretical grounding for the proposed reward shaping method, highlighting the boundedness and well-defined nature of the average-cost objectives under different policies. The use of Lyapunov functions to promote stability is especially insightful.

3. **Empirical Validation**: A comprehensive empirical study across multiple environments convincingly demonstrates the effectiveness of the STOP approach. The clear illustrations of the agentsâ€™ performance improvements in the face of previously noted difficulties lend credibility to the proposed methods. The results consistently show that STOP outperforms vanilla PPO and other baseline methods, which is a strong validation of the efficacy of the proposed framework.

4. **Ablation Studies**: The inclusion of ablation studies significantly strengthens the paper by allowing for a clear understanding of the contributions of each component of STOP. This granular analysis is essential for advancing future research in the field.

5. **Practical Implications**: The applied contexts such as queuing systems and traffic control are highly relevant and demonstrate the potential real-world impact of the proposed methodology.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Limited Exploration of Alternative Solutions**: While the authors effectively criticize existing methods that attempt to address the issues of unbounded state spaces, the exploration of alternative solutions remains somewhat superficial. A more detailed discussion on how the STOP framework could interface with or improve upon other recent advances, such as hierarchical reinforcement learning or meta-learning approaches, would enhance the paper's robustness.

2. **Potential for Overfitting**: Given the empirical results favoring the stability metrics at the expense of optimality, there is a risk of overfitting to particular environments. Further validation in a broader set of diverse environments will help confirm the generalizability of the proposed framework.

3. **Front Door Criterion Consideration**: The review of relevant literature could have included a discussion on the "front door criterion", a concept particularly important when analyzing the causal effects of the applied methods in the context of policy evaluation. This would enhance the discussion on the implications of their findings.

4. **Complexity of Implementation**: The implementation details and practical guidelines for using any proposed methods in real-world scenarios are required to facilitate the usability of the presented concepts. Illustrating a practical roadmap for deployment could encourage adoption by practitioners.

#### Conclusion
In conclusion, this paper makes a noteworthy contribution to the field of reinforcement learning by addressing fundamental challenges associated with unbounded state spaces through the innovative STOP methodology. The theoretical insights and empirical validation presented are commendable, providing an excellent foundation for future research. With minor adjustments to broaden the discussion on related works and practical implementations, this paper holds significant potential to impact the RL community. I recommend acceptance pending these revisions.
