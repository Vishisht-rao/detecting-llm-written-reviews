**Review of the Paper: "EMER DIFF: E MERGING PIXEL-LEVEL SEMANTIC KNOWLEDGE IN DIFFUSION MODELS"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel unsupervised image segmentation method, referred to as EmerDiff, which harnesses the semantic knowledge embedded within pre-trained diffusion models, specifically using Stable Diffusion (SD). The authors claim that their framework can generate fine-grained segmentation maps without supplementary training on annotated datasets, addressing a significant gap where previously developed methods relied heavily on annotations. The primary innovation lies in the extraction of semantic correspondences between low-dimensional feature maps and image pixels, achieved through a unique modulation process during the denoising steps of the diffusion model.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The proposed approach addresses an important challenge in computer vision—fine-grained semantic segmentation without training on annotated datasets. The findings could significantly impact the fields of computer vision and image processing, especially in situations where labeled data is scarce or costly to obtain.

2. **Extensive Experiments**: The paper reports comprehensive evaluations across several scene-centric datasets (COCO-Stuff, ADE20K, PASCAL-Context, and Cityscapes) both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. This strengthens the validity of the claims made by the authors regarding the capability of diffusion models in semantic understanding.

3. **Qualitative Results**: The segmentation maps produced by the framework appear clear and well-delineated, effectively capturing the necessary semantic details of the images, as showcased in the illustrative figures. The contrast against bilinearly upsampled maps emphasizes the qualitative advantage of the proposed method.

4. **Technical Contribution**: The work introduces a systematic approach to leverage the generation process of diffusion models to derive semantic correspondences, which is a meaningful contribution to the literature. The visualization of modulation effects on image pixel values illustrates a clear understanding of the internal workings of diffusion models.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limitation in Handling Small Objects**: The paper acknowledges that the method struggles with very small objects, such as animal legs or human facial features. This limitation is important and should be discussed further, as it poses a potential barrier for practical applications in real-world scenarios.

2. **Lack of Comparison with All Baselines**: While the authors do compare their method against several baselines, there could be more clarity regarding why certain recent approaches are omitted, especially in the context of open-vocabulary segmentation. Providing these comparisons would offer a more comprehensive view of the landscape and the relative performance of EmerDiff.

3. **Understanding of Semantic Knowledge**: Though the authors claim that the results suggest the presence of semantic knowledge, it would be helpful to include a more in-depth analysis or discussion of what specific semantic relations are captured by the model. This analysis could enhance the interpretability and significance of the findings.

4. **Limited Discussion of Model Generalizability**: While the framework focuses on pre-trained Stable Diffusion, it would be advantageous to include discussions on the generalizability of this approach to other diffusion models or generative architectures—especially since the authors mentioned the adaptability of the method for further research in generative models.

5. **Editing and Clarity**: The paper contains some redundancies and could be streamlined further for clarity. Certain sections could benefit from more concise language, which would enhance the overall readability of the paper.

**Conclusion:**
This paper presents a significant advancement in unsupervised image segmentation using diffusion models. The methods proposed herein are promising and have the potential to inspire further research into the unsupervised use of generative models for discriminative tasks. While some limitations and areas for improvement exist, the results indicate a solid foundation for leveraging semantic knowledge within pre-trained models. The paper is a valuable contribution to the field and should be considered for acceptance to the conference, with suggestions for minor revisions to address some of the identified weaknesses. 

The authors should also consider mentioning "text-driven video editing," as its relevance could attract a broader audience and spark discussions related to application domains beyond still images.
