**Review of "On the Paradox of Generalizable Logical Reasoning in Large Language Models"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a thorough investigation into the logical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly focusing on their performance when semantic information is decoupled from language reasoning processes. The authors argue that while LLMs show emergent few-shot reasoning abilities in natural language contexts, their generalization to logical reasoning, particularly in formal tasks devoid of semantics, is fundamentally lacking. The study explores two paradoxes: (1) LLMs' reliance on semantic representations for reasoning, and (2) the limited generalization to novel logical rules even after fine-tuning on symbolic reasoning tasks.

**Strengths:**
1. **Clarity of Argument**: The authors effectively articulate the central hypotheses and present a clear structure that guides the reader through the investigation.
   
2. **Comprehensive Experimental Design**: The paper employs a well-defined experimental setup that includes both symbolic and natural representations of reasoning tasks. This balance provides insightful contrasts that bolster the authorsâ€™ conclusions.

3. **Insightful Findings**: The results highlight significant observations regarding LLMs' reliance on semantic shortcuts, questioning the extent to which these models can truly emulate human-like generalizable reasoning. 

4. **Contribution to the Field**: The paper addresses critical gaps in the understanding of LLMs' logical reasoning capabilities, contributing valuable insights that may inform future research aimed at improving reasoning in these models.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Scope of Fine-tuning Experiments**: While the investigation includes a fine-tuning approach, the effectiveness of the approach is undermined by a limited training duration and possibly insufficient dataset diversity. The authors acknowledge these limitations but could provide further justification for the chosen scope.

2. **Potential Bias from Experimental Settings**: The experiments rely heavily on specific datasets and representations, which may not fully generalize across different contexts or applications. A discussion on the applicability of their findings to broader and more varied reasoning tasks would be beneficial.

3. **Discussion and Implications**: Although the findings provoke thought regarding the limitations of LLMs, the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive discussion on how these limitations could be addressed in future models, particularly in terms of training data and architectural changes.

4. **Commercialization Warning**: The results may fuel skepticism regarding the applicability of LLMs in tasks requiring rigorous logical reasoning, impacting expectations in commercial applications. The authors should address this angle more explicitly to guide practitioners.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Consider expanding the scope of the fine-tuning experiments or exploring the impact of varying training data quality and quantity on performance.
- Provide a richer discussion on the implications of these findings for the development of future LLMs and their logical reasoning capabilities.
- Address the potential concerns regarding commercialization and user expectations of LLMs in logical reasoning domains.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper presents significant findings that challenge existing notions of LLM reasoning capabilities. It is well-structured and provides a valuable contribution to our understanding of the relationship between semantics and reasoning in LLMs. Despite its limitations, it sets a solid foundation for future explorations aimed at enhancing the logical reasoning abilities of language models. The exploration of the term "real-time detection" in the context of LLMs suggests broader implications in applying these models, warranting further investigation.
