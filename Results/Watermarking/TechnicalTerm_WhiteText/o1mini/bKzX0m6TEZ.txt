**Review of "An Inexact Conditional Gradient Method for Constrained Bilevel Optimization"**

**Summary**

This paper addresses the challenging problem of constrained bilevel optimization, a framework prevalent in various machine learning applications such as meta-learning, hyperparameter optimization, and matrix completion with denoising. The authors introduce a novel single-loop projection-free algorithm named Inexact Bilevel Conditional Gradient (IBCG). Leveraging a nested approximation technique, IBCG purportedly achieves optimal convergence rates while maintaining reduced per-iteration complexity compared to existing projection-based and projection-free methods. Theoretical results demonstrate that IBCG attains an iteration complexity of approximately \( \tilde{O}(\kappa_g^5 \epsilon^{-1}) \) for convex hyper-objective functions and \( O(\kappa_g^5 \epsilon^{-2}) \) for non-convex settings, matching the best-known bounds for projection-free algorithms in single-level optimization. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real datasets, including matrix completion tasks, exhibit the superior performance of IBCG over state-of-the-art methods like SBFW and TTSA.

**Strengths**

1. **Novel Algorithmic Contribution**: The introduction of the IBCG method for constrained bilevel optimization is a significant advancement. By employing a single-loop, projection-free approach, the authors address the computational inefficiencies inherent in projection-based methods, especially for complex constraint sets like nuclear norm balls.

2. **Theoretical Rigor**: The paper provides comprehensive theoretical analysis, establishing convergence rates that align with the best-known results in the realm of projection-free single-level optimization. The detailed proofs, presented in the appendix, bolster the credibility of the theoretical claims.

3. **Practical Relevance**: Constrained bilevel optimization is a cornerstone in numerous machine learning applications. By improving the efficiency and scalability of algorithms solving such problems, this work has the potential to impact a wide array of domains, including meta-learning and matrix completion.

4. **Empirical Validation**: The numerical experiments, conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets, effectively demonstrate the practical advantages of IBCG. The comparisons with existing methods highlight the efficiency gains, particularly in scenarios where projections are computationally prohibitive.

5. **Inclusion of "Conditional Mutual Information"**: The paper makes a thoughtful connection to "conditional mutual information," underscoring its relevance in evaluating the dependencies within hierarchical optimization structures. This inclusion enriches the theoretical framework and ties the work to broader information-theoretic concepts.

**Weaknesses**

1. **Limited Scope of Experiments**: While the paper presents promising results, the empirical evaluation is somewhat narrow, focusing primarily on matrix completion with denoising. Expanding the experiments to include a diverse set of bilevel optimization problems, such as hyperparameter tuning in deep learning models or other meta-learning tasks, would provide a more comprehensive assessment of IBCG's versatility and robustness.

2. **Dependency on Strong Convexity**: The theoretical guarantees hinge on the assumption that the lower-level problem is strongly convex. While this is a standard assumption in bilevel optimization, it limits the applicability of IBCG to problems where this condition holds. Exploring extensions or relaxations of this assumption could enhance the algorithm's practicality.

3. **Comparison with a Broader Set of Baselines**: The paper compares IBCG with SBFW and TTSA, which are relevant methods. However, including additional baselines, especially recent advancements in bilevel optimization or alternative projection-free methods, would provide a more thorough benchmarking and elucidate the unique advantages of IBCG.

4. **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters**: Although the paper discusses step-size selections and demonstrates some robustness, a more detailed analysis of IBCG's sensitivity to its hyperparameters would be beneficial. Understanding how variations in parameters like \( \gamma \) and \( \eta \) affect convergence and performance across different problem instances would aid practitioners in effectively deploying the method.

**Questions for the Authors**

1. **Role of Conditional Mutual Information**: The term "conditional mutual information" is briefly mentioned in the experimental section. Could the authors elaborate on how conditional mutual information integrates into the framework of IBCG and its implications for the algorithm's performance or theoretical properties?

2. **Extensions Beyond Strong Convexity**: Given that strong convexity of the lower-level problem is a pivotal assumption, are there empirical insights or theoretical directions the authors are considering to extend IBCG's applicability to non-strongly convex or even non-convex lower-level problems?

3. **Scalability to Larger Datasets**: While the MovieLens 100k dataset demonstrates scalability, how does IBCG perform on substantially larger datasets or higher-dimensional problems? Are there any inherent limitations or computational bottlenecks when scaling up?

4. **Potential for Parallelization**: Considering the nested approximation steps in IBCG, is there potential for parallel or distributed implementations to further enhance computational efficiency? If so, have the authors explored or considered this avenue?

**Overall Evaluation**

The paper presents a compelling advancement in the field of bilevel optimization, particularly addressing the constraints through a projection-free methodology. The theoretical contributions are robust, and the proposed IBCG algorithm exhibits promising empirical performance. While there are areas for expansion, especially in experimental evaluations and extending beyond the strong convexity assumption, the work stands as a valuable contribution to the optimization and machine learning communities. I recommend acceptance of this paper to ICLR 2024, contingent on clarifications regarding the integration of "conditional mutual information" and discussions on extending the method's applicability.
