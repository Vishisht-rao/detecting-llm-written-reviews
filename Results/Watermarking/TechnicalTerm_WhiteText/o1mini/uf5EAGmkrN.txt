**Review of "Dynamical Versus Bayesian Phase Transitions in a Toy Model of Superposition"**

**Summary:**
The paper investigates the phase transitions in a Toy Model of Superposition (TMS) utilizing Singular Learning Theory (SLT). It offers both theoretical derivation and empirical validation of phase transitions associated with critical points represented by regular k-gons within the model, focusing on their relationship to stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training and Bayesian inferences.

**Contribution:**
The authors claim to bridge two approaches to understanding phase transitions in learning dynamics—dynamical and Bayesian—by demonstrating that critical points in the parameter space correlate with transitions in both the loss landscape during SGD and the Bayesian posterior distribution as a function of sample size. The formulation of an internal model selection principle is a noteworthy contribution, enhancing the theoretical framework surrounding the learning processes of neural networks.

**Strengths:**
1. **Theoretical Rigor:** The framework is underpinned by well-established theories such as SLT and provides a fresh perspective on how these theoretical underpinnings relate to practical learning algorithms.
2. **Novel Insights:** The identification of k-gon critical points adds depth to our understanding of how complex behaviors can emerge during learning, suggesting that regions of parameter space can be traversed sequentially as training progresses.
3. **Empirical Validation:** The empirical results supporting theoretical claims serve to bolster the paper's credibility. The experiments are extensive, employing both SGD dynamics and Bayesian sampling to reinforce the findings.
4. **Interactive Visualizations:** The use of figures to illustrate transitions visually aids in conveying complex ideas, enhancing the reader's understanding of the theoretical claims.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity of Analysis:** While the paper provides valuable insights, the heavy reliance on intricate mathematical formulations may pose accessibility challenges for readers unfamiliar with SLT or the mathematical frameworks used.
2. **Limited Generalizability:** The focus on a toy model, while beneficial for clarity, raises questions about how applicable these insights are to more complex and real-world scenarios involving deep learning systems.
3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The reliance on MCMC and the challenge of sampling from the posterior can lead to variability in results, as acknowledged by the authors. This sensitivity can complicate interpretations of results, as minor changes in learning dynamics have been shown to influence critical outcomes significantly.

**Specific Comments:**
- The paper's organization is mostly coherent, although some sections would benefit from clearer summaries of key findings or results to facilitate smoother navigation for the reader.
- More justification regarding the selection of specific hyperparameters for MCMC sampling should be provided, as this could influence the robustness of the empirical findings.
- Future work should explore the implications of these findings in non-linear models or models with larger capacity to assess the discovered relationships' generalizability.

**References to Note:**
- The comparison to existing literature on gradient descent dynamics and phase transitions provides a solid context for the paper's contributions, although more recent references could enhance the literature review component.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents substantial findings regarding the interplay between dynamical and Bayesian learning transitions within a mathematically sound framework. While it is an influential piece in the area of phase transitions in neural networks, some elements could strengthen its impact and accessibility. The insights gained from this study may form a foundational basis for future explorations that bridge theory and practice in machine learning, thereby contributing meaningfully to advancing understanding within the field.
