**Review of "Curvature Explains Loss of Plasticity"**

**Summary:**
The authors present an intriguing paper that investigates the phenomenon of loss of plasticity in neural networks during continual supervised learning. They propose that the underlying mechanism for this loss can be attributed to a reduction in curvature, specifically through a decrease in the rank of the Hessian matrix during training. The paper systematically reviews existing explanations for plasticity loss and subsequently provides experimental evidence to support their hypothesis. They also introduce a novel regularization approach that helps preserve curvature and mitigate plasticity loss.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Contribution**: The assertion that curvature (specifically, the rank of the Hessian) directly influences plasticity loss is a refreshing perspective in the continual learning literature. The paper effectively moves the conversation forward, stepping beyond previous conjectures and providing empirical backing for the proposed mechanism.

2. **Comprehensive Experimental Design**: The study is well-structured, with experiments conducted across multiple benchmarks (MNIST and CIFAR-10) and various activation functions. The comparison against prior explanations for loss of plasticity enhances the credibility of their findings.

3. **Clarity in Presentation**: The writing is clear and organized. The paper effectively guides the reader through the background, methodology, results, and implications of the findings, making it accessible even to readers less familiar with the intricate details of continual learning and optimization landscapes.

4. **Regularizer Innovation**: The introduction of a Wasserstein initialization regularizer is a practical and compelling addition that may have implications for improving the stability of plasticity in neural networks.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limitations on Hessian Approximation**: While the authors discuss the blockwise approximation of the Hessian, they acknowledge that this may limit the generality of their findings. Future work should aim to explore the full Hessian and its dynamics directly for a more comprehensive understanding.

2. **Underlying Mechanisms**: Although the paper identifies a strong correlation between curvature loss and plasticity loss, it does not delve deeply into the broader implications of why curvature decreases during training. Understanding what drives this change in curvature could be pivotal for developing robust continual learning algorithms.

3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Despite the promising results with the Wasserstein regularizer, the paper mentions sensitivity to regularization strength. Insights into optimal tuning strategies or adaptive methods could further enhance the practical application of this regularizer.

4. **Generalization to Other Domains**: The experiments are primarily confined to image data and standard datasets. It would be beneficial for the authors to discuss how their findings might transfer to other domains, particularly given the increasing importance of continual learning in areas like natural language processing and reinforcement learning.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper makes a substantial contribution to the understanding of plasticity in neural networks by tying it to curvature dynamics. The proposed regularization method and empirical findings provide valuable insights that may inspire future research in continual learning. Addressing the identified limitations and further expanding the scope of the research could lead to even more impactful results. I recommend acceptance of this paper at ICLR 2024, pending minor revisions to clarify limitations and implications.
