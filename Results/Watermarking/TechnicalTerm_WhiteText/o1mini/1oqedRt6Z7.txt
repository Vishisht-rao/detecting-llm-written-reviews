**Review of "CONVOLUTIONAL DEEPKERNEL MACHINES" by Edward Milsom, Ben Anson, and Laurence Aitchison**

*Published at ICLR 2024*

**Summary**

In "Convolutional Deep Kernel Machines," Milsom et al. present a significant advancement in the realm of kernel methods by introducing Convolutional Deep Kernel Machines (DKMs). Building upon the foundation laid by Yang et al. (2023), the authors extend DKMs to convolutional architectures, thereby enabling the application of these models to more complex and larger-scale datasets such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The paper's core contributions include the development of a novel inter-domain inducing point approximation tailored for convolutional settings, the integration of normalization techniques analogous to batch normalization, and the exploration of various likelihood functions and top-layer configurations. Empirical results demonstrate that Convolutional DKMs achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among kernel methods, boasting 99% accuracy on MNIST, 92.7% on CIFAR-10, and 72% on CIFAR-100, all while maintaining computational efficiency with training times around 77 GPU hours.

**Significance and Novelty**

The introduction of convolutional structures into DKMs represents a noteworthy stride in bridging the gap between theoretical kernel approaches and practical deep learning models. Traditional kernel methods, particularly those based on the Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP) limit, have historically underperformed finite neural networks due to their inability to perform representation learning. By retaining the flexibility of representations through the Bayesian representation learning limit, Convolutional DKMs effectively address this limitation. Additionally, the novel inter-domain inducing point scheme is a commendable innovation that enhances scalability, making DKMs applicable to more substantial and intricate datasets without a prohibitive increase in computational resources.

**Technical Contributions**

1. **Inter-Domain Inducing Point Scheme**: The authors adeptly navigate the challenges of applying inducing point methods to convolutional settings by developing an inter-domain approach. This method circumvents the inefficiencies of naively taking images as inducing points, which would result in prohibitive computational complexity. Instead, the inducing points are designed to store information in a different domain, optimizing both memory and computation.

2. **Normalization and Scaling Techniques**: Drawing inspiration from batch normalization in neural networks, the paper introduces analogous normalization and scaling schemes for Gram matrices within DKMs. These techniques contribute to smoother training dynamics and improved model performance, ensuring that the representations remain stable and meaningful across layers.

3. **Likelihood Functions and Top-Layer Configurations**: The exploration of both Gaussian and categorical likelihoods, alongside variations in top-layer configurations (e.g., global average pooling vs. linear layers), provides a comprehensive understanding of how these factors influence model behavior and performance. The empirical results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of categorical likelihoods for classification tasks, aligning with expectations.

4. **Empirical Validation**: The extensive experiments conducted on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets underscore the practical efficacy of the proposed Convolutional DKMs. Achieving SOTA performance among kernel methods, particularly the impressive 92.7% accuracy on CIFAR-10, positions this work as a pivotal milestone in kernel-based deep learning.

**Relation to Masked Language Models**

While the primary focus of the paper is on convolutional architectures for image classification, the underlying principles of representation learning resonate with advancements in "masked language models." Just as masked language models excel by effectively capturing contextual representations from sequential data, Convolutional DKMs achieve similar feats in the visual domain by learning flexible and adaptive representations. This parallel highlights the broad applicability of the Bayesian representation learning framework across diverse domains, reinforcing the universal importance of robust representation learning mechanisms in modern machine learning paradigms.

**Strengths**

- **Innovative Approach**: The extension of DKMs to convolutional architectures and the development of an inter-domain inducing point scheme are both innovative and technically sound.
  
- **Comprehensive Experiments**: The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their model across multiple datasets and a variety of hyperparameters, ensuring that the reported results are robust and reliable.
  
- **Efficiency**: Achieving high accuracy with relatively modest computational resources (77 GPU hours) is particularly impressive and makes the approach scalable.

- **Theoretical Foundations**: The paper is grounded in solid theoretical principles, with detailed derivations provided in the appendices, which enhances its credibility and usefulness to the research community.

**Areas for Improvement**

- **Scalability to Larger Datasets**: While the authors acknowledge the limitation of not having tested on high-resolution datasets like ImageNet, addressing scalability more comprehensively would strengthen the work. Future iterations could explore optimizations such as mixed precision arithmetic or distributed computing to tackle larger datasets.

- **Integration with Other Modalities**: Extending the framework to handle other data modalities, such as text or audio, could demonstrate the versatility of Convolutional DKMs beyond image classification.

- **Comparison with Deep Learning Models**: While the paper excels in comparing with kernel methods, including a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art deep neural networks would provide additional context regarding the performance and practical applicability of DKMs.

**Conclusion**

Milsom et al. have made a commendable contribution to the field of kernel-based machine learning by introducing Convolutional Deep Kernel Machines. Their work not only advances the theoretical understanding of DKMs but also provides practical solutions that bring kernel methods closer in performance to conventional deep neural networks. The meticulous development of normalization techniques and inducing point schemes, coupled with strong empirical results, positions this paper as a valuable reference for researchers aiming to harness the power of kernel methods in complex, real-world applications. The inclusion of concepts akin to "masked language models" in the context of representation learning further underscores the broad relevance and potential of their approach across different domains.
