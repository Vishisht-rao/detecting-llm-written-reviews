**Review of "ON RECONSTRUCTABILITY OF GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS"**

**Overview:**
The paper investigates the expressive power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) from the perspective of graph reconstructability, which focuses on whether the topological information of a graph can be recovered from node-level representations. The authors propose a new model, the Graph Reconstructable Neural Network (GRNN), and introduce Nearly Orthogonal Random Features (NORF) to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of GNNs in preserving reconstructability. The paper includes both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations, demonstrating that the proposed GRNN outperforms existing models in terms of reconstructability and computational efficiency.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Contribution**: The focus on graph reconstructability as a metric for GNN expressiveness is a fresh perspective that extends the current discourse beyond global isomorphism tests. This change in focus provides a nuanced understanding of GNN capabilities, particularly regarding local structural preservation.

2. **Theoretical Framework**: The authors develop a solid theoretical foundation for their claims, supported by propositions and the use of known GNN architectures (GCN and GIN) as case studies. This theoretical analysis enhances the credibility of their findings, particularly Propositions 1 to 5 which detail conditions for reconstructability.

3. **Efficiency Improvements**: Introducing NORF to maintain orthogonality while reducing computational overhead is a significant improvement for practical applications of GNNs, as it addresses known scalability issues associated with identity features.

4. **Empirical Validation**: The substantial number of empirical experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets strengthens the findings of the theoretical claims. The consistent performance of GRNN across various tasks (link prediction, community detection) demonstrates practical applicability.

5. **Clear Structure**: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making complex ideas accessible. The figures and tables are helpful in summarizing key findings and presenting experimental results.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Lack of Comparative Depth**: While the paper does compare GRNN with other models (e.g., GCN, GIN), a deeper exploration of how GRNN relates to more contemporary GNN architectures and cutting-edge techniques might provide additional insight into its relative performance.

2. **Limited Discussion on Limitations**: The authors highlight the strengths of their model, but there is insufficient discussion regarding potential limitations or scenarios where GRNN may not perform optimally. Including such analysis would provide a more balanced perspective.

3. **Experimental Conditions**: The reliance on specific datasets for comparison (e.g., PubMed and Actor) may not adequately represent diverse real-world scenarios. An expanded set of datasets, especially those with varying graph properties, could enhance robustness.

4. **Broad Applicability**: The exploration of NORF and GRNN is primarily framed around certain assumptions regarding graph structures (e.g., homophily vs. disassortative). A discussion on how broadly applicable these techniques are across different types of graphs or domains is warranted.

5. **Future Work**: While the mention of exploring heterogeneous and knowledge graphs as future work is a step in the right direction, elaborating on specific aspects of these extensions in the conclusion would provide clearer direction.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of GNN research by shifting the focus to graph reconstructability. The theoretical insights, combined with empirical evidence showing the effectiveness of GRNN and NORF, present a compelling case for further exploration in this direction. Addressing the identified weaknesses could ultimately strengthen the paper and broaden its impact on current research in graph representation learning.
