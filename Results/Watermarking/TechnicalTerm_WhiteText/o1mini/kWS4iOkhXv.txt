**Review of "SCALABLE LIPSCHITZ ESTIMATION FOR CNNs"**

**Summary:**
The authors propose a novel method, referred to as the Dynamic Convolutional Partition (DCP), to estimate the Lipschitz constant of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) efficiently, particularly for networks that are both deep and wide. The Lipschitz constant is an important measure of the adversarial robustness and generalization capability of neural networks. The proposed method effectively partitions large convolutional blocks into smaller blocks, allowing scalability in the computation process, which is a significant limitation of existing methods.

**Strengths:**

1. **Relevance and Importance:** The estimation of the Lipschitz constant is critical in understanding the robustness of neural networks, especially in adversarial settings. The topic is timely and relevant given the increasing deployment of CNNs in safety-critical applications.

2. **Novel Approach:** The DCP method's approach to divide convolutional blocks using joint layer and width-wise partitioning adds a new perspective to the existing methods. This innovation is promising and provides a theoretical foundation for scalability.

3. **Theoretical Contributions:** The authors provide theoretical proofs bounding the Lipschitz constant of larger blocks based on the smaller constituent blocks. The use of relevant lemmas from functional analysis strengthens the paper's contribution to the field.

4. **Empirical Validation:** The experiments demonstrate significant improvements in computation time and scalability without sacrificing the accuracy of the Lipschitz estimates compared to existing methods, making the contributions empirically sound.

5. **Detailed Methodology:** The thoroughness of the methodology, including feasibility evaluation, partition factor impacts, and dynamic partition search strategies, makes the proposed framework robust and well-engineered.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity of Presentation:** The paper is dense and could benefit from improved clarity in explanation, particularly in the methodology sections (Sections 4). Simplifying some complex terms or breaking down results into more digestible parts would enhance accessibility for readers unfamiliar with the technical background.

2. **Limited Testing Scenarios:** While the paper claims advantageous performance in terms of scalability and accuracy compared to benchmark methods, the experiments seem to focus on a few architectures and datasets (e.g., MNIST and CIFAR-10). Broader testing across a variety of CNN architectures or additional datasets could further substantiate the efficacy of DCP.

3. **Real-World Application:** Although theoretical and empirical results are provided, the real-world applicability and performance should be discussed more thoroughly. The paper could mention "online inference" scenarios where these Lipschitz estimates would be critical, as practical deployment involves considerations like efficiency and computation overhead.

4. **Future Work Section:** While future directions are outlined, they could be more specific about potential challenges or limitations they anticipate when applying DCP to more complex network structures (e.g., networks that encapsulate convolutional blocks).

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper presents a strong contribution to the domain of Lipschitz constant estimation for neural networks. The proposed DCP method addresses a fundamental challenge in the scalability of existing methodologies with promising results. With some refinements in clarity and expanded testing, this work could significantly impact both theoretical and practical aspects of neural network robustness assessment. The authors are congratulated on their contributions and encouraged to consider the suggested improvements for future drafts.
