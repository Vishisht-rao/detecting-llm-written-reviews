**Review of "MMD GRAPH KERNEL: EFFECTIVE METRIC LEARNING FOR GRAPHS VIA MAXIMUM MEAN DISCREPANCY"**

*Authors: Yan Sun, Jicong Fan*

**Summary**

The paper introduces a novel approach to graph metric learning through the development of Maximum Mean Discrepancy-based graph kernels, termed MMD-GK. The authors present both unsupervised and supervised (deep) extensions of MMD-GK, aiming to enhance the adaptability and discriminative power of graph kernels. The core idea revolves around leveraging MMD to compare node representations of graphs processed via message-passing mechanisms. Additionally, the paper offers a comprehensive theoretical analysis, including robustness and generalization bounds, and validates the proposed methods through extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets for graph clustering and classification. Notably, the authors highlight the applicability of their methods to "large-scale graph learning," underscoring the scalability of their approach.

**Strengths**

1. **Innovative Integration of MMD with Graph Kernels:**
   The paper's primary contribution is the introduction of MMD-GK, which effectively incorporates the Maximum Mean Discrepancy metric into graph kernel computation. This integration allows for a more nuanced comparison of graph distributions, addressing limitations inherent in traditional graph kernels that rely on overlapping substructures and manually crafted features.

2. **Deep Extensions for Enhanced Flexibility:**
   The proposed Deep MMD-GK models introduce trainable parameters into the embedding aggregation process, enabling adaptive learning of graph representations in both supervised and unsupervised settings. This flexibility is crucial for capturing complex graph structures and improving performance across diverse tasks.

3. **Theoretical Rigor:**
   The authors provide detailed theoretical analyses, including robustness bounds (Theorems 1 and 2) and generalization error bounds for supervised learning. These theoretical guarantees bolster the credibility of the proposed methods and offer valuable insights into their performance under perturbations and in generalization scenarios.

4. **Competitive Computational Complexity:**
   Despite the inherent complexity of graph comparisons, the paper demonstrates that MMD-GK and Deep MMD-GK maintain competitive computational efficiency. Theoretical complexity analyses are complemented by empirical runtime evaluations, showcasing scalability suitable for "large-scale graph learning."

5. **Empirical Validation:**
   Extensive experiments across five benchmark datasets (DHFR, BZR, MUTAG, PTC FM, PROTEINS) illustrate the superiority of MMD-GK and Deep MMD-GK over state-of-the-art graph kernels and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in both clustering and classification tasks. The consistent outperformance, especially in tasks requiring discriminative metrics, underscores the practical efficacy of the proposed methods.

6. **Availability of Code:**
   The provision of the source code on GitHub (https://github.com/yan-sun-x/MMD-Graph-Kernel) enhances the reproducibility of the research and facilitates further exploration and application by the research community.

**Weaknesses**

1. **Scalability Concerns:**
   While the authors address computational complexity and demonstrate reasonable runtimes on synthetic and benchmark datasets, the quadratic dependency on the number of nodes (O(nÂ²)) in some components may pose challenges for extremely large graphs. Although the paper mentions applicability to "large-scale graph learning," empirical evaluations on significantly larger datasets would more convincingly establish scalability.

2. **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters:**
   The performance of Deep MMD-GK appears sensitive to hyperparameter settings, such as the number of levels (L) and kernel bandwidths (h). While the paper provides practical insights into parameter configurations, the necessity for extensive hyperparameter tuning might limit the ease of application in diverse real-world scenarios.

3. **Limited Diversity in Datasets:**
   The experimental evaluation, though comprehensive across five datasets, predominantly consists of chemical and biological graphs. Incorporating a wider variety of graph types, such as social networks or knowledge graphs, could better demonstrate the generalizability and robustness of the proposed methods across different domains.

4. **Readability and Depth of Theoretical Sections:**
   The theoretical sections, especially the proofs of theorems, are densely packed and may be challenging for readers without a strong mathematical background. While rigorous, simplifying some explanations or providing more intuitive interpretations alongside formal proofs could enhance accessibility.

**Conclusion**

"MMD GRAPH KERNEL: EFFECTIVE METRIC LEARNING FOR GRAPHS VIA MAXIMUM MEAN DISCREPANCY" presents a significant advancement in graph metric learning by introducing MMD-based graph kernels that address key limitations of traditional methods. The combination of innovative methodology, theoretical robustness, and strong empirical performance positions this work as a valuable contribution to the field, particularly in the context of "large-scale graph learning." Future research could build upon this foundation by addressing scalability further and extending evaluations to more diverse graph types.

**Recommendation: Accept**

The paper's novel approach, backed by solid theoretical and empirical support, makes it a compelling addition to the conference proceedings. Its potential impact on both theoretical developments and practical applications in graph learning warrants its acceptance.
