**Review of "Investigating the Impact of Data Distribution Shifts on Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation"**

**Overview**

This paper presents a comprehensive study on cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD), particularly focusing on its vulnerability to data distribution shifts across different modalities. The authors introduce the Solution Space Divergence Hypothesis (SSDH) to elucidate how discrepancies in data distributions between teacher and student models impede effective knowledge transfer. To mitigate these challenges, they propose the Perceptual Solution Space Mask (PSSM), a novel technique designed to enhance cross-modal KD by addressing solution space inconsistencies. The paper includes both theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluations across four multimodal datasets, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed approach.

**Strengths**

1. **Novel Hypothesis and Methodology**: The introduction of the SSDH provides a fresh perspective on understanding the limitations of cross-modal KD. By highlighting the role of solution space divergence due to data distribution shifts, the authors offer a clear theoretical foundation for their subsequent methodological contributions.

2. **Perceptual Solution Space Mask (PSSM)**: The proposed PSSM is a well-motivated and innovative solution to the identified problem. By dynamically weighting the alignment between teacher and student outputs based on distribution discrepancies, PSSM effectively reduces the negative impact of mismatched data distributions.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The paper conducts thorough experiments across synthetic and real-world datasets, including MNIST/MNISTM and SemanticKITTI. The extensive evaluation not only validates the SSDH and PSSM but also demonstrates their generalizability across different modalities and tasks.

4. **Theoretical Rigor**: The inclusion of theoretical analysis grounded in Vapnik–Chervonenkis (VC) theory strengthens the paper's contributions. The authors provide a clear justification for why unimodal KD serves as an upper bound for cross-modal KD under their hypothesis.

5. **Comparative Analysis**: By comparing PSSM with several classical single-modal KD methods, the authors convincingly showcase the superior performance of their approach, especially under significant data distribution shifts.

6. **Clarity and Presentation**: The paper is well-written, with logical organization and clear explanations of complex concepts. Visualizations, such as t-SNE plots and probability distribution graphs, effectively illustrate the impact of solution space divergence and the benefits of PSSM.

**Weaknesses**

1. **Limited Exploration of Alternative KD Techniques**: While the focus on logit distillation is justified, the paper could benefit from a discussion on how PSSM might interact with other KD approaches, such as feature-based or relational KD.

2. **Assumption Constraints**: The theoretical analysis relies on several strong assumptions, such as identical model capacities and modality strengths. In real-world scenarios, these conditions may not hold, and the paper would benefit from addressing the implications of relaxing these assumptions.

3. **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters**: Although experiments vary parameters like α and β, a more in-depth analysis of the sensitivity of PSSM to these hyperparameters across different datasets would provide additional insights into its robustness.

4. **Dimension Reduction Reference**: The paper could enhance its discussion by elaborating on how "dimension reduction" techniques, as mentioned in the supplementary materials, interact with or support the proposed PSSM method. Integrating this aspect into the main narrative would provide a more holistic view of the methodology.

**Suggestions for Improvement**

- **Broaden KD Scope**: Explore the applicability of PSSM to other KD paradigms beyond logit distillation to demonstrate its versatility.
  
- **Relax Assumptions**: Conduct experiments where model capacities and modality strengths differ to assess the practical applicability of SSDH and PSSM.

- **Hyperparameter Analysis**: Provide a more detailed analysis of how varying hyperparameters affects performance, potentially offering guidelines for selecting optimal values in different contexts.

- **Integrate Dimension Reduction**: Include a discussion on "dimension reduction" within the primary sections to clarify its role and benefits in the context of cross-modal KD and PSSM.

**Conclusion**

Overall, this paper makes significant contributions to the field of knowledge distillation by addressing a critical gap related to data distribution shifts in cross-modal settings. The introduction of SSDH and the innovative PSSM method are well-supported by both theoretical and empirical evidence. Despite minor areas for improvement, the work is robust, clearly presented, and offers valuable insights that could influence future research in multimodal learning and knowledge transfer.

**Recommendation**: **Accept**

The paper presents a novel and well-executed study on cross-modal knowledge distillation, offering both theoretical and practical advancements that are likely to be of high interest to the ICLR community.
