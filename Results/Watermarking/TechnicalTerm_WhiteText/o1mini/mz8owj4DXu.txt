**Review of "Scalable Language Model with Generalized Continual Learning"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel framework for continual learning in language models called the Scalable Language Model (SLM). The authors introduce two main components: Joint Adaptive Re-Parameterization (JARe) and Dynamic Task-related Knowledge Retrieval (DTKR). The proposed approach aims to effectively manage the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and enhance the capacity for knowledge retention across sequential tasks without relying on traditional methods like experience replay, optimization constraints, or inference task-IDs. The authors claim that their method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach**: The integration of JARe and DTKR is a stimulating idea that tackles the significant issues of catastrophic forgetting in continual learning frameworks. By leveraging dynamic retrieval of task-related knowledge and adaptive parameterization, the authors contribute to an increasingly important area of machine learning research.

2. **Extensive Experiments**: The authors conduct thorough experiments with various model architectures (BERT, T5, LLaMA-2) on several benchmarks. The paper provides comprehensive quantitative results that suggest a substantial improvement in performance compared to existing methods. Additionally, comparisons under both full-set and few-shot scenarios boost the credibility of the findings.

3. **Practical Implications**: The elimination of dependencies on experience replay and task-ID enhances the applicability of continual learning models in real-world scenarios. This addresses a significant pain point in deploying AI systems that learn incrementally and interact with dynamic environments.

4. **Detailed Analysis**: The authors provide a detailed analysis and ablation studies that clarify the contributions of each component of the proposed framework, allowing for a better understanding of its practical advantages.

5. **Code Availability**: Making the code available on a public repository is a commendable choice that encourages further research and application of the proposed method.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Computational Costs**: While the authors briefly acknowledge that their method incurs some additional computational and memory costs, a more rigorous analysis of these costs compared to alternative methods would strengthen their discussion. The balance between performance gains and resource consumption is critical for real-world applications.

2. **Clarifying Terminology**: The introduction of terms such as "Joint Adaptive Re-Parameterization" and "Dynamic Task-related Knowledge Retrieval" could benefit from clearer definitions in the abstract and introduction sections. The paper would be improved if the authors briefly explain these concepts more explicitly for readers less familiar with continual learning methods.

3. **Limited Generalization to Non-Language Tasks**: The focus on language-related tasks is a strength of the paper but also limits its broader applicability. Future iterations of this research could explore the potential of SLM across different domains beyond natural language processing.

4. **Scalability in Real World**: The authors should thoroughly discuss the scalability of their framework in production scenarios, including implications for handling a truly large number of tasks, each with potentially high variability in inputs and outputs.

5. **Omission of Specific Techniques**: While the paper mentions acquiring knowledge through processes such as “triplet loss,” specific implementations and evaluations of those techniques are missing from the core discussion. 

**Overall Evaluation:**
The paper demonstrates a significant contribution to the field of continual learning in language models. With its innovative approach, meticulous experimentation, and practical insights, it positions SLM as a noteworthy step forward in addressing the issues of catastrophic forgetting. The authors should consider addressing the mentioned weaknesses to further enhance the paper's impact and clarity. I recommend accepting the paper for ICLR 2024, pending minor revisions.
