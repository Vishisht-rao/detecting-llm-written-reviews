**Review of "StructChart: Perception, Structuring, Reasoning for Visual Chart Understanding"**

**Summary**

The manuscript presents **StructChart**, a novel framework designed to enhance visual chart understanding by unifying chart perception and reasoning tasks. Recognizing the limitations of existing approaches that treat these tasks separately, the authors propose a structured and label-efficient paradigm that leverages Structured Triplet Representations (STR) in place of traditional Linear CSV Tokens (LCT). Additionally, **StructChart** introduces the Structuring Chart-oriented Representation Metric (SCRM) for comprehensive evaluation of chart perception performance and employs a Large Language Model (LLM)-based self-inspection data production scheme to generate a synthetic dataset, SimChart9K. Through extensive experiments on various chart-related tasks, including question answering, summarization, and redrawing, the framework demonstrates significant performance improvements and enhanced generalizability across different datasets.

**Strengths**

1. **Unified Approach**: By addressing both perception and reasoning in a single framework, **StructChart** effectively bridges the task gap identified in prior works. The introduction of STR as an intermediate representation facilitates a more cohesive transition between extracting chart information and performing downstream reasoning tasks.

2. **Innovative Representation**: The shift from LCT to STR is well-motivated, offering a more robust and position-invariant method for capturing the relationships within chart data. This structured approach not only improves interpretability but also enhances the performance of reasoning modules like GPT-3.5.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation Metric**: The development of SCRM provides a nuanced and flexible means to assess chart perception quality, accommodating various tolerance levels and ensuring applicability across diverse chart types. This addresses a significant gap in existing evaluation methodologies.

4. **Data Augmentation via LLMs**: The use of an LLM-based self-inspection data production scheme to generate SimChart9K is a commendable strategy for overcoming the scarcity and labor-intensive nature of chart data annotation. This augmentation not only enriches the dataset diversity but also contributes to the label efficiency of the learning paradigm.

5. **Empirical Validation**: The extensive experimental results across multiple datasets and tasks convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of **StructChart**. Notably, achieving high performance with as little as 20% of real data highlights the potential of the proposed method in practical, resource-constrained scenarios.

6. **Consideration of "Cross-Modal" Interactions**: The discussion on related works cleverly incorporates the term "cross-modal," situating **StructChart** within the broader context of vision-language pre-trained models (VLPMs) and emphasizing its potential for bridging visual and textual modalities.

**Weaknesses**

1. **Dependence on LLMs for Data Generation**: While the use of LLMs for synthetic data generation is innovative, it may introduce biases inherent in the models. The paper would benefit from a discussion on how such biases are mitigated and the impact they may have on the generalizability of **StructChart**.

2. **Limited Discussion on Chart Types**: Although the paper covers several chart types (e.g., bar, pie, line), it remains unclear how **StructChart** performs on more complex or hybrid charts. An evaluation on a wider variety of chart types, including those with overlapping elements or interactive components, would provide a more comprehensive assessment.

3. **Scalability Concerns**: The framework's scalability to extremely large or diverse datasets is not thoroughly explored. Future work could address how **StructChart** handles scalability issues, especially in real-world applications where charts can vary significantly in design and complexity.

4. **Evaluation of Reasoning Tasks Beyond QA**: While the paper provides qualitative results for summarization and redrawing tasks, a quantitative evaluation would strengthen the claims regarding **StructChart**'s reasoning capabilities. Providing metrics for these tasks or expanding the evaluation to include additional reasoning benchmarks would enhance the robustness of the findings.

**Suggestions for Improvement**

1. **Bias Mitigation Strategies**: Incorporate a section detailing the steps taken to ensure that synthetic data generated by LLMs does not introduce unintended biases, thereby ensuring fair and unbiased performance across diverse real-world charts.

2. **Expanded Evaluation**: Extend the empirical evaluation to include a broader range of chart types and reasoning tasks. Quantitative metrics for all downstream tasks, not just question answering, would provide a more holistic view of **StructChart**'s capabilities.

3. **Scalability Analysis**: Discuss the computational and resource requirements of **StructChart**, especially in the context of scaling to larger datasets or deploying in real-time applications. Providing insights into the framework's efficiency and potential bottlenecks would be valuable for practitioners.

4. **Ablation Studies**: Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of key components, such as STR and SCRM, on overall performance. This would offer deeper insights into which aspects of **StructChart** contribute most significantly to its success.

**Conclusion**

"StructChart" presents a significant advancement in the field of visual chart understanding by effectively unifying perception and reasoning through innovative data representations and efficient data augmentation techniques. The introduction of Structured Triplet Representations and the Structuring Chart-oriented Representation Metric addresses critical gaps in existing methodologies, while the LLM-based data generation strategy enhances label efficiency. Despite some areas for further exploration, the framework's strong empirical performance and thoughtful design principles make it a promising contribution to **cross-modal** vision-language research and practical chart analysis applications.
