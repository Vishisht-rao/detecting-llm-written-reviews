**Review of "Neural Functional A Posteriori Error Estimates"**

**Summary**

The paper introduces a novel loss function, termed **Astral (neurAl a posteriori funcTIONAL Loss)**, designed for both supervised and physics-informed training of neural networks and neural operators aimed at solving partial differential equations (PDEs). The key innovation lies in integrating **functional a posteriori error estimates** into the loss function, enabling the neural network to not only approximate solutions to PDEs but also provide rigorous upper bounds on the approximation error through a computationally efficient post-processing step. The authors provide a solid theoretical foundation based on established error estimation theories and validate their approach through extensive numerical experiments on a variety of elliptic problems. The results demonstrate that training with the Astral loss function yields solutions with better or comparable accuracy to traditional methods while simultaneously enabling the recovery of high-quality error bounds.

**Strengths**

1. **Innovative Approach**: The integration of functional a posteriori error estimates into the loss function is a significant advancement. This approach offers a systematic way to construct loss functions that are agnostic to the underlying approximation method, making it particularly well-suited for neural network-based solvers that often function as "black boxes."

2. **Theoretical Rigor**: The paper builds upon well-established theories in functional a posteriori error analysis, ensuring that the proposed loss function is grounded in solid mathematical principles. The derivation of the Astral loss for elliptic equations is detailed and demonstrates a clear path for extending the methodology to other types of PDEs.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The authors conduct extensive numerical experiments across multiple architectures, including Fourier Neural Operators, Deep Operator Networks, and classical neural network architectures like Dilated Residual Networks and UNet. This breadth of experimentation not only validates the robustness of the Astral loss but also showcases its versatility across different neural network paradigms.

4. **Error Control and Robustness**: One of the standout features of the Astral loss is its ability to provide tight upper bounds on the approximation error, which remains valid irrespective of the quality of the approximate solution. This property is crucial for applications requiring reliable error estimates, such as "biologically inspired modelling" where precision and reliability are paramount.

5. **Applicability to Parametric PDEs**: The paper extends the applicability of the Astral loss to parametric PDEs, addressing important questions related to accuracy, sensitivity to problem parameters, and architectural dependencies. The results indicate that the Astral loss performs consistently well across varying conditions, further underscoring its utility.

**Weaknesses**

1. **Scope of PDEs**: While the paper focuses extensively on elliptic and convection-diffusion equations, it remains unclear how well the Astral loss generalizes to other classes of PDEs, especially those with more complex or non-linear characteristics. Future work could explore this aspect to broaden the applicability of the proposed method.

2. **Computational Overhead for Certificate Prediction**: Although the Astral loss reduces the need for computationally intensive optimization during inference by leveraging neural networks to predict error certificates, there might still be inherent computational costs associated with training dual outputs (approximate solution and certificates). A more detailed analysis of the computational efficiency compared to traditional a posteriori error estimation methods would be beneficial.

3. **Dependency on Functional Error Estimates**: The approach relies on the availability of functional a posteriori error estimates for the PDEs in question. This dependence might limit the method's applicability to scenarios where such error estimates are either unknown or difficult to derive.

4. **Interpretation of "Biologically Inspired Modelling"**: The inclusion of the term "biologically inspired modelling" seems somewhat tangential to the core contributions of the paper. While it's valuable to highlight applications in areas like biological systems where accurate PDE solvers are essential, the connection could be more explicitly drawn and elaborated upon to strengthen the paper's relevance to this domain.

**Relation to Existing Work**

The paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field by bridging the gap between traditional a posteriori error estimation methods and modern neural network-based PDE solvers. It differentiates itself from prior work by offering a loss function that inherently incorporates error bounds, thereby providing both accuracy and reliability. Compared to methods that focus solely on minimizing residuals or employing generalization error analyses, the Astral loss offers a more direct and practical means of controlling approximation errors.

**Impact and Future Directions**

The proposed Astral loss function has the potential to significantly enhance the reliability of neural PDE solvers, making them more suitable for critical applications such as weather forecasting, optimization, and "biologically inspired modelling." By providing rigorous error bounds, practitioners can have greater confidence in the solutions generated by neural networks, facilitating their adoption in fields where precision is non-negotiable.

Future research could focus on extending the Astral loss to a broader range of PDEs, optimizing computational efficiency, and exploring its integration with other advanced neural network architectures. Additionally, a deeper exploration of its applicability in "biologically inspired modelling" scenarios could uncover novel insights and applications.

**Conclusion**

"Neural Functional A Posteriori Error Estimates" presents a compelling and well-structured approach to enhancing the reliability of neural network-based PDE solvers through the innovative Astral loss function. The combination of theoretical soundness, practical robustness, and extensive empirical validation makes this work a substantial contribution to the field. Addressing the outlined weaknesses could further strengthen its impact and applicability across diverse domains.

**Recommendation**: **Accept with Minor Revisions**

The paper is recommended for acceptance after minor revisions, particularly to clarify the connection to "biologically inspired modelling" and to provide additional insights into the computational trade-offs introduced by the dual-output training scheme.
