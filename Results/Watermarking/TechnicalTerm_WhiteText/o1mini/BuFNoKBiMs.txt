**Review of "Decoupled Marked Temporal Point Process Using Neural ODEs"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel framework named Dec-ODE for modeling Marked Temporal Point Processes (MTPP), which aims to disentangle the influences of individual events on the overall dynamics of asynchronous temporal events. The authors leverage Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) to model these dynamics flexibly, addressing multiple inference problems such as density estimation and survival rate computation. They claim that this decoupled approach enhances both computational efficiency and interpretability compared to existing methods.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty of Approach:** The decoupling of individual event influences within MTPP is an innovative contribution to the field. By employing Neural ODEs, the authors provide a unique solution to the challenges of inferring the complex dynamics of asynchronous events.
  
2. **Empirical Validation:** The paper includes comprehensive experiments across various real-world datasets, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of Dec-ODE against state-of-the-art methods. The results show competitive performance in terms of prediction accuracy and computational time, affirming the utility of the proposed framework.

3. **Explainability:** The discussion on model explainability is compelling. The ability to visualize how individual events influence the overall process is crucial for practitioners in real-world applications, and the approach presented enhances this aspect over traditional methods.

4. **Efficiency:** The parallel computation scheme proposed to solve the dynamics independently is a significant improvement, resulting in substantial time savings during training.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Theoretical Foundation:** While the practical applications and results are well articulated, the theoretical justification behind the decoupled dynamics approach could be expanded. A more detailed discussion on the implications of using Neural ODEs for this specific application and their convergence properties would strengthen the paper.

2. **Limited Discussion on Scalability:** Although the current results are promising, the paper does not thoroughly address the scalability of the approach when applied to very large datasets or high-dimensional event types. More discussion on this aspect, along with empirical results from larger datasets, would be beneficial.

3. **Comparison with Other Models:** While the paper compares Dec-ODE with several baseline models, a more extensive analysis of why those particular models were chosen would provide clarity. Additionally, the discussions could delve into failure cases of current methodologies compared to Dec-ODE to highlight its unique advantages more vividly.

4. **Generative Modeling:** The performance of Dec-ODE in the context of generative models is briefly noted, yet it lacks a thorough examination. Expanding on this could provide insights into how the framework can be applied in generative modeling scenarios beyond MTPP.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper introduces a significant advancement in MTPP modeling by utilizing a decoupled Neural ODE framework. The empirical results validate the proposed approach, highlighting its potential for both efficient computation and enhanced interpretability. However, strengthening the theoretical foundation, addressing scalability, and expanding discussions around generative modeling would contribute to its robustness. I recommend this paper for acceptance with minor revisions, focusing particularly on the aforementioned weaknesses.
