**Review of "AVAILABILITY ATTACKS NEED TO CREATE SHORTCUTS FOR CONTRASTIVE LEARNING"**

**Summary:**
The paper explores the landscape of availability attacks in machine learning, especially focusing on the contrastive learning paradigm. The authors argue that existing availability attacks predominantly target supervised learning models and are inadequate when faced with contrastive learning algorithms. They observe that contrastive unlearnability necessitates different shortcuts compared to supervised unlearnability, primarily hinging on alignment and uniformity gaps between clean and poisoned datasets. To address this issue, the authors propose two novel attack methodologiesâ€”Augmented Unlearnable Example attack (AUE) and Augmented Adversarial Poisoning attack (AAP). The empirical results demonstrate that these proposed methods achieve enhanced unlearnability across multiple algorithms, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Contributions:** The paper presents a fresh perspective on availability attacks, providing a clear delineation of the differences in unlearnability strategies between supervised and contrastive learning frameworks. The introduction of AUE and AAP is a substantial contribution to the field.
2. **Robust Methodology:** The threat model and evaluation metrics presented are comprehensive. The introduction of worst-case unlearnability provides a productive approach for the evaluation of unlearnable examples.
3. **Thorough Experiments:** The authors conduct extensive experiments across multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-100) and report results systematically, showcasing the effectiveness of their proposed attacks over existing baseline approaches.
4. **Relevant Discussion:** The detailed exploration of shortcuts required for contrastive learning enriches the paper, making it a valuable resource for researchers looking into data protection strategies in machine learning.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity of Presentation:** The paper's presentation, especially in Sections 4 and 5, could be streamlined. The extensive use of technical jargon and complex mathematical formulations may hinder comprehension for readers not deeply familiar with the underlying concepts. A clearer exposition could significantly enhance readability.
2. **Potential Overfitting:** While the experiments yield strong improvements, it would be beneficial for the authors to include discussions regarding the potential for overfitting on specific datasets or tasks. For instance, do the proposed attacks generalize well to other datasets not covered in the experiments?
3. **Lack of Real-World Data Considerations:** While the theoretical foundation and empirical results are impressive, the paper lacks a thorough discussion of real-world applicability. For instance, how do these attacks behave in dynamic or adversarial real-world scenarios?

**Minor Comments:**
- Some references could be updated to include the most recent literature on availability attacks and contrastive learning.
- The notation in the mathematical formulas could be modified for clarity. Some symbols were not clearly defined at their first appearance, which could lead to confusion for the reader.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents significant findings in the domain of availability attacks against contrastive learning. The contributions are well-founded and clearly articulated, albeit with a complex presentation. With revisions aimed at improving clarity and addressing the points mentioned, this work has the potential to make a substantial impact in the field of machine learning and data protection. I recommend acceptance with the condition that the authors consider the feedback provided in this review.
