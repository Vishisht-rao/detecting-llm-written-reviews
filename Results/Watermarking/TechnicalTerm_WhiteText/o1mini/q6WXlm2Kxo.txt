**Review of "Masked Diffusion as Self-Supervised Representation Learner"**

**Summary:**
The manuscript presents a novel framework, the Masked Diffusion Model (MDM), as a self-supervised representation learning approach primarily aimed at semantic segmentation tasks. This approach substitutes traditional additive Gaussian noise in diffusion models with a masking mechanism, inspired by the successful Masked Autoencoder (MAE). The authors assert that MDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various datasets, especially in few-shot scenarios. The study provides theoretical insights into the interrelation between generative capabilities and representation learning in diffusion models while proposing the utilization of Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) loss in place of the conventional Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss to enhance downstream task performance.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Approach**: The proposal of using masking as an alternative to Gaussian noise in diffusion models is innovative and holds promise within the domain of self-supervised learning.
  
2. **Theoretical Contribution**: The paper provides a thoughtful discussion on the relationship between diffusion models’ generative capacity and their utility as representation learners. This analysis could pave the way for further research in understanding and refining self-supervised techniques.

3. **Strong Experimental Results**: The authors present comprehensive experiments across diverse datasets, showcasing significant improvements in segmentation tasks, particularly in challenging few-shot scenarios. Their results substantiate the efficacy of the proposed model over conventional diffusion models and prior works like MAE.

4. **Practical Implications**: The ability of MDM to perform robustly with limited labeled data is notably valuable for domains such as medical imaging, where acquiring detailed annotations is often labor-intensive and expensive. 

5. **Thorough Ablation Studies**: The manuscript includes extensive ablation studies that clarify the impacts of various configurations and design choices, including the evaluation of different corruption strategies and loss functions, which enhances the credibility of the findings.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Scope of Applicability**: While the approach is promising, the authors have primarily focused on the U-Net architecture. Future work exploring MDM's applicability to other architectures and data modalities may strengthen the framework's relevance and usability.

2. **Loss Function Dynamics**: The findings surrounding the effectiveness of SSIM loss over MSE are intriguing but may benefit from deeper theoretical justification. A more thorough examination of the scenarios where SSIM loss outperforms MSE could provide finer insights into its operational dynamics.

3. **Generalization to Other Tasks**: Although preliminary evaluations on CIFAR-10 indicate that MDM can generalize beyond segmentation, comprehensive investigations across various tasks would reinforce this claim. Expanding generalization studies could enhance the impact and receptiveness of the model in broader applications.

4. **Implementation Details**: The complexity of the proposed model and its training regimen might challenge reproducibility. A clearer outline of hyperparameters, along with possible training pitfalls, would be beneficial for practitioners aiming to implement this approach.

**Conclusion:**
This manuscript presents a well-structured and innovative contribution to the realm of self-supervised representation learning, particularly in the context of diffusion models and semantic segmentation tasks. The promising results, along with the theoretical grounding, position the MDM as a worthwhile avenue for future exploration and application. Nevertheless, addressing the highlighted weaknesses could bolster the paper’s impact and facilitate a broader range of applicability. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, particularly in regard to elaborating on generalization studies and providing additional clarity on implementation details. 

**Rating: Strong acceptance with minor revisions.**
