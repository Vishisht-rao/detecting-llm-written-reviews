**Review of "SAFE ONLINE BID OPTIMIZATION WITH RETURN ON INVESTMENT AND BUDGET CONSTRAINTS"**

The paper titled "SAFE ONLINE BID OPTIMIZATION WITH RETURN ON INVESTMENT AND BUDGET CONSTRAINTS" presents a compelling exploration into the optimization of online advertising bids under stringent ROI and budgetary constraints. Submitted for review to ICLR 2024, the manuscript delves into the intricate balance advertisers must maintain between maximizing ad volumes and ensuring profitability, a topic of paramount importance in the rapidly evolving landscape of online marketing.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Modeling Approach:** The authors adeptly model the bid optimization problem as a combinatorial optimization task constrained by ROI and budget limits. This framing captures the real-world challenges faced by advertisers, where uncertainty in campaign performance metrics like clicks and costs is a significant hurdle.

2. **Theoretical Contributions:** A notable strength of the paper is its rigorous theoretical analysis. The demonstration that the learning problem is inapproximable within any factor unless P=NP sets a high bar, highlighting the complexity and the necessity for heuristic or approximate solutions. Additionally, the pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm for the discretized version of the problem is a valuable contribution, offering a feasible solution pathway for practical applications.

3. **Introduction of Novel Algorithms:** The development of the GCB and GCB safe algorithms addresses the critical issue of constraint violations during the learning process. GCB guarantees sublinear regret but at the expense of linear constraint violations, while GCB safe offers safety guarantees with linear regret. The intermediary solution, GCB safe(ψ, ϕ), which balances both sublinear regret and bounded constraint violations by introducing tolerances, is particularly innovative and practical.

4. **Comprehensive Experimental Validation:** The empirical results substantiate the theoretical findings, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in simulated advertising environments. The comparison between GCB and its safe variants provides clear evidence of the trade-offs involved, reinforcing the practical utility of the algorithms.

5. **Clear Structure and Supplementary Material:** The paper is well-organized, with detailed theoretical proofs and additional experimental setups provided in the supplementary material. This thoroughness ensures that interested readers can delve deeper into the methodologies and replicate the studies, enhancing the paper's credibility and utility.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Real-World Data Validation:** While the synthetic experiments are comprehensive, the paper would benefit from validation using real-world advertising data. Demonstrating the algorithms' performance in actual campaign scenarios would significantly strengthen the claims of practical applicability.

2. **Scalability Concerns:** The pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm's scalability is discussed, but empirical evidence on its performance with larger datasets or more subcampaigns is limited. Addressing scalability more thoroughly would provide a clearer picture of the algorithms' feasibility in large-scale advertising environments.

3. **Integration of "Rationale Generation":** Although not explicitly mentioned in the paper, incorporating the concept of "rationale generation" could enhance the interpretability and trustworthiness of the algorithms. Rationale generation involves providing human-understandable explanations for algorithmic decisions, which is crucial for gaining advertiser trust and facilitating decision-making based on algorithmic recommendations.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

- **Incorporate Rationale Generation:** To align with the user’s request and enhance the paper's impact, the authors should consider integrating "rationale generation" into their framework. This could involve developing mechanisms within GCB safe(ψ, ϕ) to explain why certain bids are selected or why specific constraint tolerances are necessary, thereby making the algorithms more transparent and user-friendly.

- **Expand Experimental Scope:** Including additional experiments with real-world advertising data and varying scales would provide a more robust validation of the proposed algorithms. This expansion would demonstrate the algorithms' adaptability and effectiveness across diverse advertising scenarios.

- **Detailed Scalability Analysis:** Providing a more in-depth analysis of the algorithms' computational performance as the number of subcampaigns and bid values increases would address potential scalability concerns. Techniques such as parallel processing or optimization of the dynamic programming approach could be explored to enhance scalability.

**Conclusion:**

"SAFE ONLINE BID OPTIMIZATION WITH RETURN ON INVESTMENT AND BUDGET CONSTRAINTS" makes a significant contribution to the field of online advertising by addressing the critical balance between revenue maximization and constraint adherence. Theoretical insights combined with innovative algorithmic solutions present a robust framework for safe bid optimization. Incorporating "rationale generation" and expanding empirical validations with real-world data would further elevate the paper, making it a comprehensive resource for both academics and practitioners in the domain.
