**Review of "Active Domain Adaptation of Medical Images Using Feature Disentanglement"**

**Summary**

The paper presents a novel approach to address the challenge of domain shifts in medical image analysis through active domain adaptation (ADA). The authors introduce a feature disentanglement network (FDN) that decomposes image features into domain-specific and task-specific components, facilitating the identification of informative samples for active learning. By defining multiple cost functions based on uncertainty, domainness, density, and novelty, the method selectively annotates target domain samples to enhance model performance while minimizing annotation costs. The proposed method is evaluated on the CAMELYON17 histopathology dataset and two chest X-ray datasets (NIH ChestXray14 and CheXpert), demonstrating state-of-the-art performance compared to existing domain adaptation and active learning techniques.

**Strengths**

1. **Innovative Feature Disentanglement Approach:** The decomposition of features into domain-specific and task-specific components is a significant contribution. This separation allows the model to better handle domain shifts by focusing on task-relevant features while mitigating the influence of domain-specific variations.

2. **Comprehensive Informativeness Metrics:** The integration of multiple criteria—uncertainty, domainness, density, and novelty—in determining sample informativeness provides a robust framework for active learning. This multifaceted approach ensures that selected samples are both informative and representative of the target domain.

3. **Extensive Experimental Validation:** The method is thoroughly evaluated on multiple datasets, including CAMELYON17 and chest X-ray datasets, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness across different medical imaging modalities. The comparisons with various state-of-the-art methods, along with detailed ablation studies, strengthen the validity of the proposed approach.

4. **Practical Relevance:** Addressing domain shifts is crucial in medical imaging, where data variability due to different imaging protocols, devices, and institutions is common. The proposed ADA method offers a practical solution to enhance model performance in real-world deployments without the need for extensive labeled data.

**Weaknesses**

1. **Limited Discussion on Clinical Relevance:** While the paper effectively addresses technical aspects of domain adaptation, it lacks a thorough discussion on the clinical implications of the approach. For instance, the impact of "vasopressor and fluid administration" data on model performance and how the ADA method integrates such physiological parameters could provide deeper insights into its applicability in clinical settings.

2. **Assumption of Feature Disentanglement Efficacy:** The method relies heavily on the assumption that the FDN can perfectly disentangle domain-specific and task-specific features. However, the paper does not provide an in-depth analysis or visualization of the disentangled features to substantiate this claim. Additional experiments or qualitative assessments could enhance the understanding of the feature disentanglement quality.

3. **Scalability Concerns:** Although the method shows promising results on the evaluated datasets, the scalability to larger and more diverse datasets is not explored. Medical imaging data can be vast and varied, and it remains unclear how the proposed ADA framework performs under such conditions.

4. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The approach involves multiple hyperparameters for both feature disentanglement and sample selection. The paper outlines the hyperparameter tuning process but does not discuss the sensitivity of the model performance to these parameters. Insights into how variations in hyperparameters affect the outcomes would be valuable for practitioners seeking to apply this method.

**Suggestions for Improvement**

1. **Incorporate Clinical Data Integration:** Including physiological data such as "vasopressor and fluid administration" could enhance the model's predictive capabilities. Future iterations of the paper could explore how integrating such clinical parameters with image data affects domain adaptation and overall model performance.

2. **Feature Visualization and Analysis:** Providing visualizations of the disentangled features would offer tangible evidence of the FDN's effectiveness. Techniques like t-SNE or PCA plots could illustrate the separation between domain-specific and task-specific features, reinforcing the methodological claims.

3. **Expand Experimental Scope:** Evaluating the method on a broader range of datasets, including those with different imaging modalities and clinical conditions, would demonstrate the generalizability and robustness of the ADA approach.

4. **Address Hyperparameter Robustness:** Conducting experiments to assess the sensitivity of the model to various hyperparameters would provide guidance on parameter selection and enhance the method's reproducibility.

**Conclusion**

The paper makes a noteworthy contribution to the field of medical image analysis by introducing a feature disentanglement-based active domain adaptation method. Its strengths lie in the innovative decomposition of features and the comprehensive approach to selecting informative samples, backed by extensive experimental validation. However, addressing the discussed weaknesses—particularly the integration of clinical data like "vasopressor and fluid administration," providing deeper analyses of feature disentanglement, and ensuring scalability—would further solidify the method's impact and applicability. Overall, the proposed approach holds significant promise for enhancing the generalizability and efficiency of deep learning models in medical imaging under domain shifts.
