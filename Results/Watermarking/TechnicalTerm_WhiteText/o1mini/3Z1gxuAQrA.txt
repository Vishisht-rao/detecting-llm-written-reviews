**Review of the Paper: "PoSE: Efficient Context Window Extension of LLMs via Positional Skip-wise Training"**

The paper "PoSE: Efficient Context Window Extension of LLMs via Positional Skip-wise Training" presents a novel approach to extending the context window of large language models (LLMs) efficiently. The authors propose a training technique named Positional Skip-wise Training (PoSE), which allows for the simulation of longer inputs while maintaining a fixed training context size. This submission is timely, given the increasing interest in LLMs with extended context capabilities relevant to tasks requiring long inputs.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach**: The concept of decoupling training length from target length is compelling. By manipulating position indices and introducing skipping bias terms, PoSE allows models to learn from a fixed context window but generalize to longer sequences effectively. This innovative perspective addresses challenges that arise from traditional methods, which often lead to significant computational costs and performance issues.

2. **Empirical Validation**: The experimental results corroborate the claims made by the authors. Demonstrating a successful extension of the LLaMA model to a context of 128k tokens with a mere 2k training context window is impressive and suggests significant practical implications. The authors provide a thorough evaluation using multiple datasets and tasks, including language modeling and passkey retrieval, showcasing consistent improvements over baselines.

3. **Compatibility**: The claim that PoSE is compatible with all RoPE-based LLMs and various position interpolation strategies adds to its utility. This broad applicability could facilitate adoption and adaptation across different models in existing research.

4. **Efficient Resource Usage**: The reported reductions in memory and time overhead are crucial for advancing the usability of LLMs for broader applications. In resource-constrained environments, the ability to use PoSE can enable researchers and practitioners to achieve state-of-the-art performance without the need for extensive fine-tuning.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Theoretical Understanding**: While the empirical results are strong, the theoretical underpinnings of PoSE could be elaborated further. A more in-depth exploration of why the proposed method preserves pre-trained language model capacities could strengthen the paper. Currently, some sections feel somewhat rushed, particularly in theoretical discussions.

2. **Discussion on Limitations**: Although the paper mentions the potential for infinite context lengths, it would benefit from a more explicit discussion regarding practical limitations, such as memory constraints during inference beyond the reported 128k tokens. Additionally, the discussion around the "sparsistency" of the method could be deeper; an explanation of how sparsistency impacts the model's performance would contribute to understanding the method's robustness.

3. **Lack of Comparative Analysis**: While benchmarking against traditional full-length fine-tuning and RandPos is commendable, more comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art methods for context extension could further contextualize the significance of PoSE. The landscape of context management is evolving rapidly, and situating the contributions of this work within that landscape would benefit readers seeking to navigate various methodologies.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, this paper is a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing and the development of LLMs. The Positional Skip-wise Training (PoSE) method presents a highly efficient and empirically validated approach to extending the context window of LLMs, showcasing a substantial reduction in resource requirements while maintaining performance. Future work could explore the theoretical implications of the proposed method further and expand comparative benchmarks to strengthen the findings. The insights provided in the paper are likely to foster further research and development in the efficient scalability of LLMs, addressing a pressing need in the field.

**Recommendation**: Given the strengths in innovation, empirical validation, and practical implications, I recommend this paper for presentation at the conference, subject to minor revisions to address the aforementioned weaknesses.
