### Review of "Benchmarking Deletion Metrics with the Principled Explanations"

#### Summary
The paper proposes a novel framework, TRAjectory importanCE (TRACE), to evaluate and improve upon existing insertion/deletion metrics used for assessing attribution-based explanation methods in deep neural networks (DNNs). The authors argue that current insertion/deletion metrics lack comprehensive analysis and they provide a structured approach aimed at scrutinizing the intricacies involved in these metrics. TRACE is presented as a principled framework that seeks to enhance the understanding of feature importance through deletion metrics while addressing key concerns such as out-of-distribution (OOD) issues that arise during feature deletion.

#### Strengths
1. **Novelty and Significance**: The introduction of TRACE as a framework is compelling and responds to significant gaps in the evaluation of deletion metrics. The examination of common pitfalls in current methodologies and the proposal of a more rigorous analysis is valuable for the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI).

2. **Rigorous Theoretical Foundation**: The authors build a solid theoretical foundation for TRACE, introducing combinatorial optimization to determine near-optimal deletion trajectories. This approach demonstrates a deep understanding of the mathematical intricacies involved in deletion metrics.

3. **Practical Implications**: The practical benchmarks for applying deletion metrics in various settings, particularly in relation to the OOD problem, can benefit researchers and practitioners aiming to utilize attribution methods effectively. The guidelines provided could aid in making informed choices regarding feature deletion and the settings of their evaluation.

4. **Empirical Validation**: The extensive experiments conducted with different models and settings provide empirical support for the claims made regarding TRACE's effectiveness over existing methods. The results convey a clear performance advantage of TRACE in demonstrating principled explanations for model predictions.

5. **Comprehensive Benchmarking**: By systematically comparing TRACE against other explanation methods, the paper adds depth to its findings and highlights the inadequacies of existing attribution methods.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Complexity and Accessibility**: While the theoretical rigor is commendable, the complexity of the TRACE optimization problem (shown to be NP-hard) may hinder accessibility for some researchers not well-versed in combinatorial optimization. More intuitive explanations or visual aids could help readers grasp the concepts more easily.

2. **Assumptions and Rigor**: Some assumptions underlying the framework, such as the independence of feature contributions, may not always hold in practical scenarios or with certain types of data. A discussion addressing these limitations and the conditions under which TRACE might falter would strengthen the manuscript.

3. **Breadth of Contexts**: The experimental validation primarily focuses on image data. While the authors assert that TRACE is applicable across various input data types, additional experiments with different domains (e.g., text or structured data) could reinforce the generalizability of their findings.

4. **Details on Integration**: Though TRACE is said to be compatible with various types of input data, the paper could provide more specifics on how TRACE can be integrated into existing XAI frameworks or processes without extensive re-engineering.

5. **Lack of Comparison with "decoder-only transformer" Models**: The manuscript would benefit from discussing how TRACE applies to or could enhance the interpretability of models using "decoder-only transformer" architectures. Given the rise of transformer-based methods in various applications, this would be a significant addition.

#### Conclusion
Overall, the paper presents a significant advancement in the study and application of deletion metrics in the context of attribution-based explanation methods. The TRACE framework serves as a promising direction for future research in XAI by providing principled insights and practical guidelines. Addressing the highlighted weaknesses would further enhance the impact and utility of this work. I recommend this paper for acceptance, as it makes a meaningful contribution to the field and invites further research and validation.
