**Review of "TACT IS-2: Better, Faster, Simpler Attentional Copulas for Multivariate Time Series"**

**Summary:**

The paper presents TACT iS-2, an innovative model for multivariate probabilistic time series prediction that builds upon the recently developed transformer-based attentional copulas (TACT iS). The authors aim to improve computational efficiency and model flexibility by proposing a new objective function and a two-stage optimization process that reduces the number of distributional parameters from factorial to linear scaling with respect to the number of variables. The model is empirically validated across multiple real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of training dynamics, accuracy, and its ability to handle complex time series characteristics such as unaligned and unevenly-sampled data.

**Strengths:**

1. **Significant Contribution to the Field**: The authors address important limitations of existing multivariate time series models, particularly those related to training dynamics and flexibility. By introducing a two-stage training curriculum, they provide a more efficient training process that leads to improved performance.

2. **Theoretical Foundation**: The paper is grounded in copula theory and includes theoretical propositions that support the validity of the learned copulas. This theoretical rigor adds robustness to the advances presented.

3. **Comprehensive Empirical Validation**: A thorough evaluation on multiple datasets demonstrates the model's state-of-the-art performance in both forecasting and interpolation tasks. The use of various metrics, including continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) and negative log-likelihood (NLL), highlights the model's effectiveness across different settings.

4. **Practical Implications**: The availability of code fosters reproducibility and encourages further research in this area. The findings can have real-world applicability in fields requiring accurate multivariate time series predictions, such as finance, energy management, and supply chain optimization.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Lack of Direct Comparison with Baselines**: While TACT iS-2 outperforms previous models such as TACT iS and others in certain parameters, the paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with a broader range of existing methodologies. This would provide a clearer context regarding the model's performance in relation to state-of-the-art approaches.

2. **Complexity of Implementation**: Although the proposed model shows better training dynamics and outcomes, the changes to architecture and the introduction of curriculum learning could pose challenges for practitioners looking to implement the model in practical scenarios. More detailed implementation guidelines or examples would be beneficial.

3. **Data Requirements**: The paper discusses the infinite expressivity assumption for the learned distributions, which could imply that the model's performance would be sensitive to data quantity and quality. A discussion regarding scenarios with limited data or non-ideal conditions would provide valuable insights into the model's applicability.

4. **Feature Analysis**: The paper mentions aspects related to "feature analysis" in the discussions of model flexibility. However, a dedicated analysis focusing on how different features impact model performance could enrich the findings and enhance understanding of model behavior.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, "TACT IS-2: Better, Faster, Simpler Attentional Copulas for Multivariate Time Series" marks an important step forward in multivariate time series prediction. The improvements in computational efficiency and model flexibility combined with a rigorous validation across diverse datasets position this work as a notable contribution to the field. While some areas could be strengthened, the foundational ideas and practical implications of TACT iS-2 are commendable and have significant potential for future research and application. 

I recommend acceptance of this paper at ICLR 2024, subject to minor revisions addressing the highlighted weaknesses.
