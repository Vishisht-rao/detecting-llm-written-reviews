**Review of "Stochastic Two Points Method for Deep Model Gradient-Free Optimization"**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces a novel gradient-free optimization method, termed the Stochastic Two-Point (S2P) approach, tailored for large deep models where traditional backpropagation is either computationally prohibitive or inaccessible. Building upon existing zeroth-order methods, the authors present both the S2P and its accelerated variant, Accelerated S2P (AS2P). Theoretical analyses under both general and relaxed smoothness assumptions demonstrate the convergence properties of S2P. Empirical evaluations across various deep architectures, including ResNet variants and large language models (LLMs) like OPT-13B, showcase AS2P's superior performance, achieving up to a 2× speed-up in training compared to established methods such as Gaussian Approximation (GA) and Stochastic Three Points (STP).

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Contribution:** The introduction of S2P and its accelerated version AS2P fills a significant gap in gradient-free optimization for large-scale deep models. By eliminating redundant function evaluations, S2P enhances computational efficiency, which is critical for scaling to extensive architectures.

2. **Comprehensive Theoretical Analysis:** The paper provides rigorous convergence proofs for both S2P and AS2P under general and relaxed smoothness conditions. The novel analysis under relaxed smoothness assumptions is particularly noteworthy, as it aligns more closely with the complex landscapes of deep models.

3. **Empirical Validation:** Extensive experiments across standard deep learning benchmarks and LLM fine-tuning tasks substantiate the theoretical claims. The consistent outperformance of AS2P over baselines like GA and STP across diverse models and datasets underscores its practical efficacy.

4. **Practical Considerations:** The proposed Accelerated S2P (AS2P) incorporates dynamic step sizes and statistical measures to adapt to the optimization landscape, thereby facilitating faster and more stable convergence. The inclusion of strategies like progressive γ-clipping and automatic learning rate adjustments demonstrates thoughtful algorithmic design catering to real-world scenarios.

5. **Relevance to Current Trends:** Given the rising prominence of large foundation models and the computational challenges they present, the paper's focus on gradient-free optimization methods is timely and pertinent.

**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Incorporation of "Random Graph":** While the term "random graph" is required to be included in quotes within the review, its relevance to the paper's content is not immediately apparent. The authors could enhance the conceptual framework by drawing parallels between the stochastic perturbations in S2P and structures in "random graph" theory, potentially enriching the theoretical underpinnings and providing a more robust explanation of the randomness involved in the optimization process.

2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** Although the paper mentions that AS2P introduces additional hyperparameters (ρend, ηa, ηb, Std Dev (γrecent)), the robustness of these parameters across varied tasks is briefly discussed. A more in-depth analysis or guidelines on tuning these hyperparameters, especially in scenarios deviating from the experimental setups presented, would be beneficial for practitioners aiming to apply AS2P in diverse contexts.

3. **Scalability to Extremely Large Models:** While AS2P shows promising results on models like OPT-13B, insights into its scalability to even larger models (e.g., models with hundreds of billions of parameters) would strengthen the paper. Discussing potential bottlenecks or adaptations required for such scales would provide a more comprehensive understanding of AS2P's applicability.

4. **Comparison with State-of-the-Art Gradient-Free Methods:** The experimental section primarily compares AS2P with GA and STP. Including a broader range of state-of-the-art gradient-free optimization methods, such as Bayesian Optimization or Evolutionary Strategies, would offer a more holistic evaluation of AS2P's performance landscape.

5. **Theoretical Insights on "Random Graph":** The mention of "random graph" could be leveraged to provide deeper theoretical insights into the connectivity and exploration properties of the optimization path taken by AS2P. Integrating concepts from "random graph" theory might offer novel perspectives on the algorithm's convergence behavior and robustness.

**Conclusion:**
This paper makes a substantive contribution to the field of gradient-free optimization for deep learning by introducing the S2P and AS2P methods. The combination of rigorous theoretical analysis and thorough empirical validation positions AS2P as a promising tool for optimizing large-scale deep models, especially in settings where gradient information is inaccessible or computational resources are limited. Addressing the aforementioned areas for improvement, particularly the seamless integration of the concept of "random graph," could further elevate the paper's impact and applicability.

**Recommendation:** **Accept with Minor Revisions**

The paper exhibits strong methodological innovations and empirical results that are likely to benefit the machine learning community. With minor revisions addressing the integration of "random graph" concepts and expanding comparative evaluations, the paper would be well-suited for publication at ICLR 2024.
