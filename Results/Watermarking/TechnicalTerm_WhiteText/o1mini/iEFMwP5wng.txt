**Review of "Reliable Test-Time Adaptation via Agreement-on-the-Line"**

**Summary:**
The submitted paper addresses the challenges of test-time adaptation (TTA) in machine learning, specifically focusing on how to make TTA methods more reliable amidst various distribution shifts. The authors leverage the phenomena of agreement-on-the-line (AGL) and accuracy-on-the-line (ACL) to propose novel methods for estimating out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracy, calibrating TTA models without labeled data, and tuning hyperparameters reliably. Their experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods across different models and datasets, showing that TTA can achieve performance estimation comparable to systems that rely on ground-truth labels.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Insight**: The discovery and verification of AGL and ACL in TTAed models provide a fresh perspective on the relationship between in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance. The empirical results convincingly support this novel observation.
   
2. **Practical Applications**: The proposed methods for OOD accuracy estimation, calibration without labeled data, and hyperparameter tuning have significant practical implications. This is essential for deploying machine learning models in real-world applications where labeled data may not be readily available.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The authors perform extensive experiments across several datasets (both synthetic and real-world) and various TTA methods, providing a robust evaluation of their approach. The inclusion of real-world shifts adds critical relevance to the findings.

4. **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is well-structured, making it easy to follow. The clear articulation of challenges in TTA sets a strong foundation for presenting the authorsâ€™ contributions.

5. **Relevance**: The topic is highly relevant in the context of current challenges in machine learning concerning model robustness and adaptability under distribution changes.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Lack of Theoretical Foundation**: While the observations regarding AGL and ACL are compelling and substantiated through experiments, the paper could benefit from a stronger theoretical explanation of why these phenomena occur, especially after TTA. A deeper investigation into the mechanisms behind these correlations could enhance the contributions.

2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Although the paper discusses the sensitivity of TTA to hyperparameters, it would be beneficial for the authors to include more quantitative analysis of how varying individual hyperparameters (not just combinations) affects performance. The significance of specific choices (e.g., learning rates) could be further highlighted.

3. **Limited Insights on Constraints**: Sections discussing limitations introduce a few constraints associated with the approach, such as reliance on labeled ID data for ACL. However, elaborating on potential ethical concerns, particularly concerning the dynamic object generation context mentioned, could add depth to the discussion. 

4. **Missing Conclusive Insights**: The investigation into failures (e.g., the negative correlation between learning rates and performance in certain models) brings important considerations to light but lacks detailed discussion on how future research might address these pitfalls.

**Overall Evaluation:**
This paper makes significant contributions to improving TTA methods through practical and empirical approaches. The exploration of AGL and ACL phenomena in the context of TTA is particularly noteworthy. Despite a few theoretical and analytical gaps, the practical implications of this work are substantial, making it a valuable addition to the field. I recommend acceptance at ICLR 2024, with suggestions for addressing the noted weaknesses in the future version.

**Recommendation**: Accept with minor revisions.
