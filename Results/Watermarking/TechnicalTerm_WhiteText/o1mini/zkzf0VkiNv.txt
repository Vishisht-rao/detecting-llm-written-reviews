**Review of "CERTIFIED ROBUSTNESS ON VISUAL GRAPH MATCHING VIA SEARCHING OPTIMAL SMOOTHING RANGE"**

The paper presents a noteworthy contribution to the field of visual graph matching (GM) by introducing a certified robustness method, termed Certified Robustness based on Optimal Smoothing Range Search (CR-OSRS). This approach addresses the significant challenge of ensuring robustness against adversarial attacks in deep visual GM, which is critical for the reliability of various downstream applications.

**Strengths**:

1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The authors successfully identify and tackle two pivotal aspects of certified robustness in deep visual GM: managing paired inputs with their inherent structural constraints and addressing the computational complexity intrinsic to the permutation output space. The proposed method effectively advances certified robustness mechanisms in a previously unexplored area, highlighting its significance.

2. **Methodology**: The use of joint Gaussian distributions for random smoothing showcases a clever adaptation of existing techniques, making it specifically suitable for the structural characteristics of GM. This methodological innovation allows the authors to capture correlations between keypoints and enhance the model's robustness while improving matching performance.

3. **Theoretical Foundation**: The paper provides a robust theoretical framework, including the derivation of an ℓ2-norm certified space that is well-articulated. The inclusion of two quantification methods for the certified space—sampling and marginal radii—adds depth to the evaluation of robustness.

4. **Experimental Validation**: The extensive set of experiments across multiple datasets indicates a thorough validation process. The results demonstrate that CR-OSRS outperforms existing methods, including directly applying randomized smoothing techniques. The use of various GM solvers also broadens the applicability of the proposed method.

5. **Public Accessibility**: The commitment to make the source code publicly available is commendable, facilitating further research and potential applications in the community.

**Weaknesses**:

1. **Complexity of Presentation**: While the theoretical and methodological foundations are strong, certain sections, particularly the mathematical formulations and proofs, may benefit from clearer explanations or visual aids. They could present a barrier to understanding for readers less familiar with the specific nuances of graph matching and certified robustness.

2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: The paper discusses multiple hyperparameters impacting model performance; however, it would be beneficial to provide additional insights or guidance on hyperparameter tuning to aid practitioners in applying CR-OSRS in real-world scenarios.

3. **Limited Applicability beyond GM**: While the paper delineates its focus on visual GM, a discussion regarding the broader applicability of the CR-OSRS approach to other combinatorial optimization domains (or a lack thereof) could enrich the paper’s impact. This particularly applies to the potential use of similar "tensor methods" that could benefit from this framework.

4. **Experimental Scope**: While the presented experiments are comprehensive, including additional datasets with diverse visual characteristics could strengthen the claims regarding the generality of the proposed methods.

**Conclusion**:

Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the certified robustness of visual graph matching, presenting a novel approach that promises to enhance the reliability of deep visual GM in adversarial settings. With considerations for the clarity and depth of certain sections and broader applicability discussions, it stands as a strong candidate for acceptance at ICLR 2024. The potential for future research building off this foundation is substantial, and the authors are encouraged to consider the suggestions provided in this review.
