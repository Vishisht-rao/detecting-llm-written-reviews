**Review of "Predicting the Performance of Foundation Models via Agreement-On-The-Line"**

**Summary**

The paper presents a novel approach to estimating the out-of-distribution (OOD) performance of foundation models (FMs) using the "Agreement-on-the-Line" (AGL) phenomenon. Building upon the work of Baek et al. (2022), which demonstrated the reliability of AGL for predicting OOD accuracy in ensembles of CNNs trained from scratch, the authors extend this methodology to the context of lightly fine-tuned FMs. Given the prevalent use of fine-tuning in adapting large pre-trained models to specific downstream tasks, this extension is both timely and highly relevant. The authors investigate various sources of randomness—namely, random linear head initialization, data shuffling, and data subsetting—to induce the necessary diversity among fine-tuned models. Remarkably, they find that random linear head initialization alone suffices to achieve strong AGL behavior across multiple modalities, including image classification with CLIP and question answering/text classification with large language models (LLMs) like GPT and OPT. Additionally, the paper explores the application of AGL to ensembles of FMs pretrained on diverse datasets, demonstrating consistent AGL behavior and enabling reliable OOD performance estimation without labeled data.

**Strengths**

1. **Addressing a Critical Problem:** Estimating OOD performance is paramount for the safe deployment of machine learning models. The ability to do so without labeled OOD data significantly reduces practical barriers, making this work highly impactful.

2. **Extension of Existing Paradigms:** By adapting AGL to fine-tuned FMs, the authors bridge a gap between traditional ensemble methods and modern foundation model utilization. This extension is non-trivial and opens avenues for broader applicability of AGL-based methods.

3. **Empirical Rigor:** The paper conducts extensive experiments across multiple datasets and model architectures, including CLIP for image classification and various LLMs for question answering and text classification. This breadth of evaluation strengthens the validity of the findings.

4. **Unexpected Insights:** The discovery that random linear head initialization alone can induce sufficient diversity for AGL behavior, even in linear models built on pre-trained features, challenges existing assumptions and contributes to a deeper understanding of model robustness.

5. **Practical Relevance:** The proposed methods are computationally tractable and applicable in real-world scenarios where only a single base FM is available, enhancing the practicality of AGL-based OOD estimation.

**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Theoretical Foundations:** While the empirical results are compelling, the paper would benefit from a more thorough theoretical exploration of why random linear head initialization is particularly effective in inducing AGL behavior. Insights into the underlying mechanisms could provide a stronger foundation for the observed phenomena.

2. **Limited Discussion on "Poisoned Sample Detection":** Although the methodology shows promise for OOD performance estimation, the paper does not explicitly address "poisoned sample detection." Integrating a discussion on how AGL-based methods could be extended or adapted for detecting poisoned samples would enhance the practical utility and scope of the research.

3. **Scalability Considerations:** While the proposed methods are computationally feasible, the paper does not extensively discuss scalability issues when applying AGL to extremely large ensembles or in resource-constrained environments. Addressing potential scalability challenges would broaden the applicability of the approach.

4. **Subpopulation Performance:** The authors rightly caution that AGL may not capture performance variations across different subpopulations within the OOD data. Future work could delve deeper into methodologies for ensuring that AGL-based estimates are robust across diverse subgroups, thereby addressing fairness and reliability concerns.

**Recommendations**

- **Incorporate "Poisoned Sample Detection":** Given the growing concerns around model security and the potential for adversarial attacks, it would be valuable to explore how AGL-based performance estimation methods can be leveraged for "poisoned sample detection." This integration could position the work at the intersection of robustness and security in machine learning.

- **Enhance Theoretical Insights:** Providing a theoretical framework or proofs explaining the efficacy of random linear head initialization in achieving AGL would strengthen the paper's contributions and offer deeper insights into model behavior under distribution shifts.

- **Expand on Practical Implementations:** Including case studies or practical implementations in real-world scenarios would demonstrate the utility of the proposed methods beyond benchmark datasets, showcasing their applicability in diverse domains.

**Conclusion**

This paper makes significant strides in extending the applicability of AGL for OOD performance estimation to the realm of fine-tuned foundation models. With thorough empirical validation and unexpected yet insightful findings regarding sources of model diversity, the work holds substantial promise for enhancing the reliability and safety of deploying large-scale machine learning models in diverse, real-world settings. Addressing the highlighted areas for improvement, particularly the integration of "poisoned sample detection," could further elevate the impact and breadth of this research.
