**Review of "Exploring Modality Collaboration with Modality-Agnostic Transformers in Multi-Modal Federated Learning"**

**Overall Impression:**
The paper presents an innovative approach to addressing the challenges in multi-modal federated learning (FL) through the introduction of a novel setting, Modality-Collaborated Federated Learning (MCFL), and a framework called Federated Modality Collaboration (FedCola). The proposal aims to enable collaboration among uni-modal clients, allowing them to benefit from shared knowledge without requiring multi-modal data. The comprehensive evaluation, including various experimental settings and comparisons with existing approaches, demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.

**Figurative Presentation:**
The paper is structured coherently, with a clear flow that guides the reader from the introduction of the problem, an overview of existing solutions, the formulation of the proposed framework, and a thorough experimental validation. The figures, especially those elucidating the differences between traditional federated learning and the proposed MCFL, are informative and aid in understanding the concepts discussed.

**Scientific Contribution:**
1. **New Setting and Framework**: The introduction of MCFL is a significant contribution to the field, as it fills a gap in existing literature focusing primarily on multi-modal tasks. The motivation to involve uni-modal clients broadens the applicability of federated learning and is particularly relevant in scenarios such as healthcare.
  
2. **Innovative Methodology**: The use of a modality-agnostic transformer to cope with model heterogeneity and modality gaps shows promise. The paper provides a sound theoretical foundation for the proposed framework and aligns well with the challenges faced in traditional multimodal systems.

3. **Empirical Evaluation**: The experimental results substantiate the claims of the paper, showing substantial improvements in performance metrics across both uni-modal and average accuracy. The comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, like CreamFL, highlight the benefits of the proposed methods without incurring additional computational costs.

**Strengths:**
- The proposed methodology is novel and timely given the increasing prevalence of federated learning applications in sensitive areas like healthcare and finance.
- The extensive range of experiments enhances the reliability of results, showcasing performance across various datasets with different levels of correlation.
- The thorough examination of the effects of different parameter-sharing and aggregation strategies provides valuable insights for future research.

**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Generalizability**: While the framework's results are promising, further validation across additional datasets and more diverse modalities would strengthen the claim of its wide applicability. The authors should consider discussing the limitations in model performance when subjected to data that deviates significantly from the presented configurations.

2. **Handling System Heterogeneity**: Although it is acknowledged in the paper that the proposed framework does not tackle system heterogeneity, it may be beneficial to at least outline potential strategies to address this issue in subsequent research. 

3. **Resource Usage and Costs**: While the paper mentions minimal computational and communication costs compared to existing methods, concrete figures or a detailed resource analysis would provide clarity on these claims, especially in practical applications.

4. **Clarity in Presentation**: Some sections could benefit from clearer explanations, particularly around the computational implications of different parameter-sharing strategies. Simplifying the discussion about the aggregation methodologies could help make the paper more accessible.

**Conclusion:**
The paper substantially advances the field of federated learning by introducing MCFL and FedCola, offering a new perspective on leveraging cross-modal knowledge without the need for multi-modal data. Its strengths lie in its innovative approach and thorough empirical validation. However, to fully establish itself as a cornerstone in multi-modal federated learning, it must address the outlined weaknesses, particularly concerning generalizability and heterogeneity issues. Overall, the paper is a valuable contribution and provides a solid foundation for future research efforts in the realm of federated learning and multi-modal collaboration.
