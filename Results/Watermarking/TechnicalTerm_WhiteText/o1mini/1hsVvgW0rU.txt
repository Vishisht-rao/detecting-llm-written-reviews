**Review of "Sample-Efficient Learning of POMDPs with Multiple Observations in Hindsight"**

The paper presents a novel approach to improving sample efficiency in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) through a new feedback model called "multiple observations in hindsight" (k-MOMDP). This innovative framework allows reinforcement learning agents to gain additional observations emitted from the latent states they encounter after each episode, without directly observing the latent states. The authors aim to address the well-documented challenges associated with learning optimal policies in POMDPs, which are typically known to require exponentially many samples in the worst case.

### Summary of Contributions

1. **Introduction of k-MOMDPs**: The authors propose the k-MOMDP feedback model, which enables the learner to collect k-1 additional observations after each episode. This model effectively augments traditional trajectory feedback and is positioned as a potential solution to circumvent the inherent difficulties of POMDP learning.

2. **Two New Classes of POMDPs**: The paper defines two subclasses: k-MO-revealing POMDPs and tabular distinguishable POMDPs. These subclasses facilitate sample-efficient learning and provide a clearer understanding of structural requirements for learning under k-MOMDP feedback.

3. **Algorithms and Theoretical Guarantees**: The authors present learning algorithms such as k-Optimistic Maximum Likelihood Estimation (k-OMLE) and OST (Optimism with State Testing). They derive sample complexity guarantees for both low-rank and tabular settings, demonstrating that these classes yield polynomial sample complexities under the proposed feedback model.

4. **Related Work and Novelty**: The paper situates itself within existing literature by comparing k-MOMDPs with prior work on revealing POMDPs and Hindsight Observable POMDPs (HOMDPs). The distinction made by the authors—that k-MOMDPs are a relaxation of HOMDPs—adds depth to the contribution but also raises questions about the practical implications of this trade-off in terms of learning efficiency and model applicability.

### Strengths

- **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is well-structured and clearly articulates its objectives, methodologies, and theoretical results. It provides a comprehensive overview of related work and situates the proposed model within that context.
  
- **Innovative Approach**: The introduction of k-MOMDPs and the exploration of additional structural conditions for learning reflect a significant advancement in the field of reinforcement learning, particularly in POMDP settings.

- **Rigorous Theoretical Guarantees**: The authors offer solid theoretical underpinnings for their algorithms, providing bounds on sample complexity that are relevant for both academic and practical applications.

### Weaknesses

- **Complexity of Implementation**: While the theoretical results are promising, the practical implementation of k-MOMDPs and the proposed algorithms may present challenges. The learning algorithm’s reliance on the assumption of collecting additional observations could complicate real-world applicability, especially in domains where such hindsight is not easily available.

- **Empirical Validation**: The paper would benefit from empirical evaluations demonstrating the performance of the proposed algorithms across varying settings. Future studies should include experiments to validate the theoretical claims and showcase the advantages of k-MOMDPs over traditional methods.

- **Scope for "Algebra"**: The paper mentions the concept of “algebra” in the context of the underlying mathematical discussions, but the connection to the proposed framework could be made clearer. Specifically, delineating how algebraic structures may play a role in the observation gathering or state testing would strengthen the paper's theoretical foundations.

### Conclusion

Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of reinforcement learning by proposing an innovative feedback model for POMDPs, elucidating new classes of learnable POMDPs, and providing theoretical validation for sample-efficient learning under these frameworks. Despite some concerns regarding implementation and empirical support, the foundational work sets the stage for future research that could shape the understanding and practical application of reinforcement learning in partially observable environments. The proposed algorithms promise to advance the state-of-the-art in sample-efficient learning and invite further exploration in the interplay between observation feedback and algorithmic design.
