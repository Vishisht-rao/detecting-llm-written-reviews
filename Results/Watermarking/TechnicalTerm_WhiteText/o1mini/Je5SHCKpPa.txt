**Review of the Paper: "Multimodal Patient Representation Learning with Missing Modalities and Labels"**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces MUSE, a novel framework aimed at learning multimodal patient representations, specifically addressing the challenges of missing modalities and labels in clinical datasets. The authors argue that traditional multimodal approaches often assume complete data availability, which is rarely the case in real-world healthcare settings. MUSE employs a mutual-consistent graph contrastive learning method that utilizes a bipartite graph structure to represent patient-modality relationships. The framework's primary strength lies in its ability to learn modality-agnostic and label-decisive features even when patient data is incomplete. Extensive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets (MIMIC-IV, eICU, and ADNI), demonstrating that MUSE outperforms existing baseline methods, especially in scenarios with missing data.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The problem of missing modalities and labels is crucial in the healthcare domain, and the proposed solution is timely and relevant. By introducing a framework that accounts for this complexity, the authors directly contribute to the ongoing discourse in multimodal representation learning.

2. **Methodological Rigor**: The design of MUSE, including the bipartite graph representation and the mutual-consistent contrastive loss, is a thoughtful approach to addressing both modality collapse and missing data issues. The methods employed for learning representations, especially the dual focus on modality-agnostic and label-decisive features, are well justified.

3. **Empirical Evaluation**: The authors provide a comprehensive empirical evaluation across multiple datasets, which adds to the robustness of their claims. The performance metrics used (AUC-ROC and AUC-PR) are appropriate for the clinical tasks at hand.

4. **Clarity of Presentation**: The paper is well-structured, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology and results. Figures and tables effectively illustrate key concepts and findings, making it accessible to readers with varying degrees of familiarity with the topic.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Generalizability**: While the results on the three datasets are promising, the paper could benefit from a discussion of the generalizability of the MUSE framework. It remains to be seen how the method would perform in other domains or with different types of data.

2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: The limited tuning of hyperparameters may raise concerns about the full optimization of the model. It would be helpful to see more extensive experiments exploring how sensitive MUSE is to different hyperparameter settings.

3. **Comparison with More Baselines**: While the paper compares MUSE against various baselines including imputation, direct prediction, and graph-based methods, additional contemporary methods—particularly those from the generative modeling domain—could enhance the evaluation.

4. **Missing Label Simulation**: The paper simulates missing labels in the evaluation, but a more thorough exploration of how MUSE performs under more realistic missing data mechanisms would strengthen the analysis. Including different types of missing data patterns, such as "missing not at random," could provide valuable insights into the framework's robustness.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

- The authors may consider conducting additional experiments with more diverse datasets and incorporating more recent models to elaborate on MUSE's comparative performance.
  
- Including a dedicated section on the limitations and assumptions made in the study could provide clarity.

- It would be beneficial to discuss the implications of using MUSE in real-world clinical settings, addressing potential implementation challenges.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of multimodal patient representation learning. While it effectively addresses the critical issues of missing modalities and labels, further validation and exploration of the model’s limitations would enhance its impact. The work is well-grounded in both theory and practice, paving the way for future research in this important area of healthcare informatics. I recommend acceptance of this paper with minor revisions.
