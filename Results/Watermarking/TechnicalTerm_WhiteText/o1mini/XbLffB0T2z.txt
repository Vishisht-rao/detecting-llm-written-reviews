**Review of "Transferable Availability Poisoning Attacks"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel approach to availability data poisoning attacks in machine learning, particularly focusing on the transferability of such attacks across different learning paradigms. The authors argue that existing poisoning attack strategies often assume that the victim uses the same learning method as the adversary, which is a strong and potentially unrealistic assumption. 

They propose a new method, Transferable Poisoning (TP), designed to improve the transferability of poisoning perturbations by generating high-frequency perturbations using the gradient information from both supervised and unsupervised contrastive learning paradigms. The experiments demonstrate that TP significantly outperforms existing poisoning methods in terms of transferability across several benchmark datasets.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Contribution**: This work addresses an important gap in the current understanding of availability poisoning attacks by explicitly considering the scenario where victims may use different learning methods. The introduction of Transferable Poisoning as a method to generate perturbations that maintain effectiveness across paradigms is highly relevant and timely given the increasing diversity of machine learning methods.

2. **Empirical Validation**: The authors provide extensive empirical results across multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet) to validate their approach. The clear comparison with existing methods and the presented results (e.g., improvements in decreasing accuracy) strengthen the reliability of their claims.

3. **In-depth Analysis**: The paper includes a thoughtful analysis of the characteristics of poisoning perturbations, indicating how the frequency characteristics correlate with the transferability of attacks. This theoretical underpinning adds depth to the findings and helps explain the effectiveness of their approach.

4. **Visualizations**: The inclusion of visualizations for perturbation characteristics (Figures 1 and 2) provides meaningful insights into the attack mechanisms, especially regarding the linear separability and frequency characteristics of the poisons generated.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Clarity and Organization**: The paper could benefit from improved clarity and organization in certain sections. The flow of information is sometimes convoluted, particularly when discussing the different algorithms and their comparisons. Clearer section headings and summaries might enhance readability.

2. **Limitations and Scalability**: While the results demonstrate significant improvements in transferability, the paper does not extensively discuss the potential limitations of the Transferable Poisoning approach in more complex, real-world scenarios, including the scalability of the method with larger datasets or higher-dimensional data.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: The comparison against existing poisoning methods, although extensive, could be supplemented with a more detailed analysis of why certain methods fail (e.g., low-frequency characteristics) but could not succeed in terms of transferability. This would provide an even deeper understanding of the method's contribution.

4. **Defense Mechanisms**: The paper does not elaborate on potential defenses against the Transferable Poisoning attack or propose how to mitigate its effects within training pipelines, which would be a critical aspect for real-world applications.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of adversarial machine learning, particularly regarding availability poisoning attacks. It presents a novel framework with strong empirical support that effectively challenges existing assumptions in poisoning attack strategies. Addressing the weaknesses noted will enhance the clarity and applicability of the research, making it an essential read for those working on adversarial robustness in machine learning systems. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions focused on clarity and the discussion of limitations and potential defenses.
