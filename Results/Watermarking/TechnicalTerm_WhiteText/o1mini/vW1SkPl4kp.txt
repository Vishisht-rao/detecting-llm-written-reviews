### **Summary**

The paper presents a comprehensive study on risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) by introducing a novel framework that leverages Iterated Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) objectives. The authors address both linear and general function approximation settings and incorporate human feedback, bridging the gap between algorithmic decision-making and human-in-the-loop systems. They propose three algorithms: ICVaR-L for linear function approximation, ICVaR-G for general function approximation, and ICVaR-HF for risk-sensitive reinforcement learning with human feedback. Theoretical analyses are provided, including regret bounds and a matching lower bound to demonstrate the optimality of their approach. Additionally, empirical experiments validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

### **Strengths**

1. **Novel Framework:** The integration of Iterated CVaR with both function approximation and human feedback is a significant advancement in risk-sensitive RL. This multifaceted approach addresses practical scenarios where risk management and human oversight are crucial.

2. **Theoretical Rigor:** The paper excels in its theoretical contributions, offering provably sample-efficient algorithms with rigorous regret analyses. The establishment of a lower bound further substantiates the optimality of the proposed methods.

3. **Algorithmic Innovations:** The introduction of ICVaR-L, ICVaR-G, and ICVaR-HF showcases thoughtful algorithmic design tailored to different approximation settings. The novel techniques, such as the efficient approximation of the CVaR operator and the refined elliptical potential lemma, demonstrate deep technical insight.

4. **Empirical Validation:** The numerical experiments, though limited in scope, effectively illustrate the practical efficiency of ICVaR-L compared to existing baselines. The consistent sublinear regret observed aligns well with the theoretical guarantees.

5. **Relevance to "Code Representation Learning":** Although not explicitly detailed, the incorporation of "code representation learning" within the context of human feedback implies potential applications in scenarios where human inputs can be represented as code, enhancing interpretability and adaptability of RL policies.

### **Weaknesses**

1. **Limited Experimental Scope:** The empirical evaluation focuses primarily on a synthetic MDP environment with relatively small state and feature dimensions. It would strengthen the paper to include experiments on more complex and diverse tasks, possibly integrating aspects of "code representation learning" to demonstrate real-world applicability.

2. **Human Feedback Integration Details:** While the paper introduces ICVaR-HF, the mechanisms by which human feedback influences the learning process, especially in relation to "code representation learning," are not thoroughly elucidated. Clarifying this interaction could provide clearer insights into practical implementations.

3. **Computational Complexity:** Although the authors discuss the space and computational complexities of their algorithms, practical implications of these complexities in large-scale environments remain unclear. Additional analysis or optimizations for scalability would enhance the applicability of the proposed methods.

4. **Assumptions and Realism:** The theoretical results rely on certain assumptions, such as the availability of a finite feature basis and the properties of the link function σ in human feedback. Discussing the realism of these assumptions in practical settings would provide a more balanced perspective.

### **Comments and Suggestions**

- **Clarification on "Code Representation Learning":** The mention of "code representation learning" could be better integrated into the framework, possibly by detailing how human feedback can be encoded or interpreted through code representations to enhance learning efficiency and policy robustness.

- **Broader Application Domains:** Expanding the experimental section to include applications in areas like autonomous driving, finance, or healthcare—where risk-sensitive RL and human feedback are paramount—would demonstrate the versatility and impact of the proposed framework.

- **Ablation Studies:** Conducting ablation studies to isolate the contributions of different components (e.g., function approximation vs. human feedback) would provide deeper insights into the strengths and potential limitations of each aspect of the framework.

### **Recommendation**

The paper makes significant theoretical and algorithmic contributions to the field of risk-sensitive reinforcement learning, particularly through the integration of Iterated CVaR with function approximation and human feedback. While the theoretical rigor is commendable, enhancing the empirical evaluation and providing more detailed discussions on practical implementations, especially concerning "code representation learning," would substantially elevate the paper. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the highlighted weaknesses and incorporate the suggested clarifications.
