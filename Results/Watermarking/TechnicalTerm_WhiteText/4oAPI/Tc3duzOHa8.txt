**Review of "RODEO: Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection via Exposing Adaptive Outliers"**

The paper proposes a novel method for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, termed RODEO, which aims to improve robustness against adversarial attacks by leveraging an adaptive outlier exposure (OE) strategy. The approach is built on the hypothesis that adaptive OE should involve outliers possessing characteristics of diversity and conceptual differentiability from inliers but remain near the in-distribution. The method combines text and image information to condition the generation process of outliers, thereby creating a set of near-distribution and diverse auxiliary samples.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Clarity:** 
   - The paper identifies a significant gap in current OOD detection models concerning performance under adversarial attack settings. It introduces an innovative approach that leverages both textual and visual information, aiming for a unified solution across various OOD detection setups.

2. **Methodological Contributions:**
   - The approach uses a pre-trained generative diffusion model conditioned on textual information extracted from the normal class labels to generate near-distribution OOD samples. This is a promising direction that utilizes multi-modal sampling for robust adversarial training.

3. **Empirical Validation:**
   - The paper includes comprehensive experiments across several benchmark datasets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and various high-resolution datasets, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method over existing techniques. The AUROC improvements reported, particularly in adversarial settings, are significant (up to 50% better in some cases).

4. **Ablation Studies:**
   - The inclusion of ablation studies strengthens the claims about the necessity of both diversity and proximity in the generated OOD samples. The studies are thorough and help in understanding the contributions of different components of the RODEO pipeline.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity and Reproducibility:**
   - The combination of diffusion models with text-based guidance, while innovative, adds complexity to the implementation. More detailed procedural steps or a repository of the code would help in replicating the results and making the method more accessible to researchers.

2. **Sensitivity to Parameters:**
   - The paper mentions setting thresholds for filtering generated data, such as τLabel and τImage, but does not provide a systemic exploration of how sensitive the performance is to these parameters. It might be beneficial to assess this sensitivity in supplemental materials.

3. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - While AUROC is a standard metric, it would be beneficial to consider other metrics like F1-score or precision-recall curves which can offer additional insights, especially where class imbalance exists in test scenarios.

**Conclusion:**

This paper addresses an important challenge in OOD detection by proposing a robust, adaptive approach that integrates "multi-modal sampling" techniques. The approach is well-justified, and empirical evaluations indicate its potential to significantly improve robustness against adversarial attacks in various settings. With some further work on reproducibility and parameter sensitivity, this method is likely to impact the field positively. The paper is a valuable contribution and should be of interest to researchers in the areas of machine learning safety, anomaly detection, and adversarial robustness.
