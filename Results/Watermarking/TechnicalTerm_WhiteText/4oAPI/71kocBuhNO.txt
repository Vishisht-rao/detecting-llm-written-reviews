**Title**: SCORE-BASED MULTIMODAL AUTOENCODERS

**Review**:

The paper presents a novel approach to enhancing Multimodal Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) by introducing Score-Based Models (SBMs) to improve the generative quality and coherence across modalities. The method offers a fresh perspective on dealing with the decline in generative quality seen in traditional multimodal VAEs as the number of modalities increases, something noted by Daunhawer et al. (2022). The paper is structured clearly, and the contributions are methodologically sound, providing empirical results supporting their claims. Below are the key aspects of the review:

1. **Innovativeness and Contribution**:
   - The introduction of SBMs to model the joint latent space of unimodal VAEs is innovative. This move away from constructing a joint posterior is well-motivated by the limitations identified in existing approaches.
   - The concept of coherence guidance adds an interesting layer to the SBM framework, aiming to improve the consistency of generated outputs, especially when fewer modalities are observed.

2. **Relevance and Significance**:
   - Multimodal learning is critical for many applications due to the ubiquity of data with multiple modalities. Solving the scalability and quality issues in existing multimodal generative models is of significant importance.
   - The paper's focus on maintaining scalability and improving quality as more modalities are observed addresses a gap in current research, potentially impacting real-world multimodal applications.

3. **Theoretical Foundation**:
   - The paper provides a strong theoretical basis for its approach. The methodological transition from a joint posterior to a joint latent space using SBMs is well-explained.
   - The derivation of the variational lower bound and the discussion on conditional independencies give the paper solid theoretical footing.

4. **Experimental Validation**:
   - Experiments on the extended PolyMNIST and CelebAMask-HQ datasets are comprehensive, highlighting the advantages of the proposed approach regarding generative quality and scalability.
   - The evaluation metrics (such as FID and conditional coherence) are appropriate, and the comparison with well-chosen baselines (e.g., MVAE, MMVAE, MoPoE) strengthens the case for the new method.
   - The inclusion of scalability tests with increasing numbers of modalities is valuable, reinforcing the paper's claims about the model's efficiency.

5. **Clarity and Presentation**:
   - The paper is well-structured, with clear sections delineating each stage of the methodology and results. The use of figures and tables effectively illustrates the performance and impact of the proposed approach.
   - The paper could benefit from clearer notation in some mathematical formulations for better accessibility.

6. **Weaknesses and Concerns**:
   - The "plug-and-play" nature of the model, as it integrates score-based models with pre-trained unimodal VAEs, might present challenges in achieving optimal results across various datasets without extensive tuning.
   - The paper states that the SBM's requirement for all modalities during training is a limitation, which suggests that further work is necessary to address scenarios with partially available modalities.
   - The computational cost of the approach, especially during inference, is highlighted as a trade-off; addressing this aspect more explicitly could enhance the paper's practical relevance.

**Overall Assessment**:
The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of multimodal generative modeling by integrating score-based models with VAEs. Its approach is both innovative and impactful, addressing key limitations in current models. Despite some limitations regarding computational demand and training requirements, the work is a noteworthy step forward in improving the quality and scalability of multimodal generative models. The paper is suitable for acceptance, with minor revisions suggested for clarity and practical considerations.
