**Review Summary for "Efficient Unsupervised Knowledge Distillation with Space Similarity"**

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Contribution:** The paper introduces a novel approach to unsupervised knowledge distillation that eliminates the need for large feature queues, which are prevalent in existing methods. This approach, titled CoSS (Cosine Space Similarity), presents a straightforward yet effective mechanism for aligning the student and teacher's embedding spaces.

2. **Efficiency:** CoSS is notably more efficient in terms of computational resources and training time compared to current state-of-the-art methods like BINGO and SEED. The results demonstrate a reduction in Total-Training-Resources (TTR) while maintaining competitive or improved distillation performance.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The authors conducted extensive experiments across various architectures (e.g., ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, ViT-Tiny) and benchmark datasets (e.g., ImageNet, CIFAR-100) to validate the efficacy and efficiency of CoSS. The inclusion of both linear evaluation and KNN classification provides a broader understanding of model performance.

4. **Robustness and Transfer Learning:** CoSS-trained models demonstrate improved robustness under data distribution shifts and transfer well to downstream tasks, suggesting that the learnt representations are more generalized.

5. **Theoretical Insight:** The paper provides a theoretical insight into why conventional contrastive learning with large feature queues might not preserve the teacher's manifold due to the lack of homeomorphism in normalization steps. The discussion using the notion of "posterior networks" and local Euclidean space is quite informative.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Comparison with Supervised Methods:** While the paper does attempt to adapt supervised distillation methods for the unsupervised setting, many methods fail or underperform. More discussion on the fundamental reasons these supervised techniques donâ€™t translate well could provide deeper insights.

2. **Ablation Studies:** Although some ablation studies are present, more detailed ablations on design choices, such as different values of lambda and comparison on segmentation tasks, could strengthen the argument for the chosen configurations. There could also be a clearer breakdown of the computational savings related to the removal of feature queues.

3. **Additional Benchmarks:** The focus on standard datasets like ImageNet and CIFAR-100 is beneficial; however, inclusion of performance on more diverse real-world datasets could better showcase the versatility of CoSS in practical applications.

4. **Qualitative Analyses:** While quantitative results are robust, providing more qualitative analyses (e.g., visualizations of learned features or self-attention maps) could offer complementary insights into what the models learn and retain from the teacher.

5. **Clarity in Some Sections:** Certain sections, particularly involving mathematical formulations and theoretical insights, could benefit from clearer explanations or additional diagrams for accessibility to a broader audience.

**Overall Evaluation:**
The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of unsupervised distillation with a method that is both innovative and computationally efficient. The empirical results are promising, indicating that CoSS is a step forward in making unsupervised distillation more practical for deployment. Addressing the above weaknesses in future iterations could further enhance the paper's impact and clarity.
