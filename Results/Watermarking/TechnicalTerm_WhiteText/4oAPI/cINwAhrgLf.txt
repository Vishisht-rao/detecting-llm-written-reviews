OUTPUT:
The paper titled "AUX-NAS: Exploiting Auxiliary Labels with Negligibly Extra Inference Cost" introduces an architecture-based approach to auxiliary learning aimed at enhancing the performance of primary tasks while maintaining comparable inference costs to single-task networks. This research appears to be well-motivated, as it addresses the limitations of existing optimization-based auxiliary learning (AL) methods that struggle with negative transfer issues when merging conflicting gradients from different tasks. The authors propose a method centered on Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to evolve a network that exploits auxiliary labels through a one-directional flow from primary to auxiliary tasks. This allows the method to sidestep computational costs during inference by removing the auxiliary-related computations.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Approach**: The paper presents a novel architecture-based paradigm that leverages a soft parameter sharing scheme, distinct from prevalent optimization-based or hard parameter sharing methods in multi-task learning (MTL).

2. **Innovative NAS Utilization**: The methodology employs a NAS algorithm to discover optimal architectures while imposing constraints to prune unnecessary auxiliary-to-primary connections. This ensures that the resulting models retain single-task inference efficiency.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments**: Extensive experimental validation across multiple datasets (NYU v2, CityScapes, and Taskonomy), tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation, depth estimation), and backbones (VGG-16, ResNet-50, ViTBase) showcases the proposed method's efficacy in boosting primary task performance.

4. **Integration with Optimization Methods**: Demonstrating the compatibility of the proposed framework with existing optimization-based AL approaches adds practical value and shows its adaptability across various learning paradigms.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Lack of Comparison with Recent Works**: While comparisons with state-of-the-art methods like Adashare and PCGrad exist, the evaluation could be extended to include more recent advancements in architecture-based MTL, especially those focusing on efficiency and scalability.

2. **Complexity in NAS Design**: Although the paper claims linear scalability concerning the number of auxiliary tasks, the implementation specifics might pose challenges for practitioners unfamiliar with NAS or those dealing with large-scale network architectures.

3. **Generalization Concerns**: The paper briefly mentions the importance of ensuring generalization from mixed models to single architectures. However, the paper could further detail how the NAS algorithm ensures the generalization of learned architectures, specifically when integrated with other optimization methods.

4. **"Proper Scoring Rule"**: The paper does not explicitly discuss the concept of "proper scoring rule," which is often considered in scenarios where model confidence and accuracy interpretations are critical. Introducing this concept could potentially enhance the evaluation criteria for models dealing with auxiliary tasks.

**Conclusion:**

The paper contributes a significant approach to handling auxiliary learning by focusing on architecture design rather than conventional optimization strategies. The intelligent use of NAS to mitigate negative transfer without inflating inference costs is robust and demonstrates the potential to impact various real-world applications. However, fine-tuning certain aspects, like comprehensive comparisons and theoretical underpinnings for generalization, could improve the depth and applicability of this research. Overall, "AUX-NAS" presents an important exploration of evolving networks for efficient multi-task and auxiliary learning.
