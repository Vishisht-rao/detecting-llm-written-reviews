**Review of "Expressive Losses for Verified Robustness via Convex Combinations"**

This paper proposes a class of loss functions termed "expressive losses" to improve the trade-off between adversarial robustness and standard accuracy in neural networks. The authors argue that current methods often choose between robust (but less accurate) or accurate (but less robust) models. They introduce a single parameter, the over-approximation coefficient, that allows for seamless transitions between the adversarial and verified loss, thus making the training adaptable to the desired robustness-accuracy trade-off. This is explored through several instantiations, such as CC-IBP, MTL-IBP, and Exp-IBP, all designed to be conceptually simple yet effective.

**Strengths:**

1. *Novel Approach*: The introduction of "expressive losses" is innovative, providing a new perspective on how coupling adversarial attacks with over-approximations can yield improved robustness-accuracy trade-offs.
   
2. *Extensive Experimental Validation*: The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation across multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10, TinyImageNet, and downscaled ImageNet. The proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing approaches in several cases.

3. *Clear Explanation*: The exposition of the proposed methods is generally clear, with an in-depth discussion of the trade-offs and the impact of the hyper-parameter  \( \beta \).

4. *Theoretical Underpinning*: The theoretical foundation supporting the idea of expressivity through convex combinations is well-presented, making the case for their implementation robust.

**Weaknesses:**

1. *Lack of Comparison with "Principled Methods"*: While the paper shows strong experimental results, it would have been beneficial to compare the proposed methods against "principled methods" (if such are defined) that focus on theoretical guarantees of robustness in a more formalized setting.

2. *Sensitivity to Hyper-Parameters*: Although the paper tunes the over-approximation coefficient \( \beta \), there is limited discussion on the sensitivity to other hyper-parameters such as the attack strength or initialization strategies. More insights into the robustness of the tuning process would be valuable.

3. *Computational Resource Details*: The paper describes various computational setups but lacks a comprehensive discussion of the computational resources required for both the training and verification processes across different setups.

4. *Complexity of Interpretability*: While the paper is conceptually simple in theory, the practical implementation of each "expressive loss" method, including the interaction with adversarial examples, could be presented in a more simplified manner to encourage adoption.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the paper presents a compelling addition to robust training literature by addressing the longstanding trade-off between accuracy and robustness. The "expressive losses" approach is not only theoretically sound but also demonstrates efficacy in practice. While improvements could be made in contextualizing the approach within broader frameworks and addressing the computational aspects, the paper is well-suited for presentation at a prestigious conference like ICLR. It advances the discussion on neural network robustness and sets a strong foundation for future exploration in this area.
