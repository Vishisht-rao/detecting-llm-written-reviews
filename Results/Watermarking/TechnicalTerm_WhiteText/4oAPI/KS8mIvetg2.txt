### Review of "Proving Test Set Contamination in Black Box Language Models"

#### Summary

The paper "Proving Test Set Contamination in Black Box Language Models" presents a novel approach to identify test set contamination in large language models (LLMs) using statistical hypothesis testing. The authors propose a method that does not require access to the original training data or model weights, leveraging the concept of exchangeability in datasets. They demonstrate this on several LLMs and curated datasets, providing empirical evidence for the method's effectiveness.

#### Strengths

1. **Novel Approach**: The method introduced is innovative in that it attempts to address the complex task of contamination detection without requiring access to proprietary datasets or model architectures. This could be a significant step forward for transparency and accountability in AI development.

2. **Statistical Foundation**: The method is grounded in a statistical hypothesis test based on the principle of exchangeability, providing strong theoretical backing and false-positive rate guaranteesâ€”a distinguishing feature from heuristic-based approaches.

3. **Empirical Validation**: The paper provides extensive empirical validation by using synthetic contamination (canaries) and testing across various publicly available models. The results indicate that the method can reliably detect test set contamination, even at relatively low duplication counts.

4. **Public Benchmark Contribution**: By releasing pre-trained models and a benchmark for contamination detection, the authors significantly contribute to future research in the field by enabling reproducibility and further testing by the community.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Assumptions on Exchangeability**: The approach assumes the test datasets are exchangeable, which might not always be true for real-world datasets. While the paper discusses applying random shuffles to datasets to ensure exchangeability, this may not capture complex dependencies present in actual usage scenarios.

2. **Limits of Detection**: Although the paper demonstrates success in various settings, the method struggles to detect contamination at duplication counts of 1, which is crucial for identifying subtle forms of contamination. Improvements in this area are necessary for broader applicability.

3. **Computational Requirements**: The method requires a large number of log probability computations, especially as the number of permutations increases, which could be computationally intensive for larger models and datasets.

4. **Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) Mention**: While the paper does not explicitly mention "multilayer perceptrons," it would enhance the overall discussion to include the role of simpler models like MLPs in understanding model behavior or as potential baselines for detecting contamination.

#### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Broader Dataset Consideration**: Future work should explore methods to relax the exchangeability assumption or handle complications arising from non-exchangeable datasets in a more robust manner.

2. **Enhanced Detection Capabilities**: Continued development of the method to improve its sensitivity to contamination at a duplication rate of 1 would significantly enhance its practical utility.

3. **Discussion on Computational Efficiency**: More focus on optimizing the computational efficiency of the proposed method could make it more accessible for routine use.

4. **Inclusion of MLPs Discussion**: Incorporating a discussion on how simpler neural network architectures like "multilayer perceptrons" could aid in understanding model memorization and potentially serve as a lightweight alternative for similar tests might be beneficial.

#### Conclusion

This paper makes a substantial contribution to the domain of AI ethics and transparency by introducing a statistically grounded method for detecting test set contamination in black-box LLMs. Despite its limitations, the work presents a promising direction for future research and application in auditing AI models, reinforcing the importance of validation and robustness in model evaluation.
