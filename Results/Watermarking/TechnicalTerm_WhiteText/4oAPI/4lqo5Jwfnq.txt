**Title:** Class-Incremental Learning with Parameter-Efficient Cross-Task Prompts

**Summary:**

The paper presents a novel framework, the Parameter-Efficient Cross-Task Prompt (PECTP), for addressing Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) scenarios. The proposed solution targets the challenges of rehearsal-free and memory-constrained CIL by introducing a mechanism to learn fixed numbers of prompts. To enhance the adaptability and effectiveness of these prompts across multiple tasks, the authors introduce a Prompt Retention Module (PRM). This module operates on two levels: Outer Prompt Granularity (OPG) and Inner Prompt Granularity (IPG), ensuring the learned prompt parameters maintain robustness across task evolution. The manuscript includes extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating that PECTP offers improved performance and efficiency compared to existing prompt techniques.

**Strengths:**

1. **Problem Relevance:** The paper addresses a critical issue in incremental learning, especially in scenarios where data privacy limits rehearsal methods. The focus on memory constraints is timely, given the increasing size and complexity of contemporary machine learning models.

2. **Innovative Approach:** The dual-level constraints (OPG and IPG) applied to prompt evolution present a novel mechanism that balances learning new tasks while retaining old ones. This potentially mitigates catastrophic forgetting effectively.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Experiments conducted across diverse datasets highlight the effectiveness of the PECTP framework. The results illustrate consistent improvements over baseline and state-of-the-art methods, reinforcing the viability of the proposed solution.

4. **Methodological Contribution:** By exploring the initialization strategies for classification layers, the paper offers additional insights into optimizing prompt-based models for CIL tasks.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Clarity of Presentation:** While the core contributions are outlined, certain sections, notably those detailing implementation specifics and the PRM components, could benefit from clearer exposition. Figures and equations, although present, occasionally lack direct interpretation within the text, potentially confusing readers.

2. **Ablation Details:** The ablation study offers insights into the operation of the PRM module, but further exploration of the trade-offs between memory costs and accuracy (e.g., prompt-length configurations) would enhance understanding.

3. **"Hardness Characterization":** Although the paper effectively extends current methodologies, it lacks direct attention to the "hardness characterization" of different tasks and how this might influence prompt retention or recall capabilities across distinct datasets.

4. **Generalization:** While the results are promising, the adaptability of the PECTP framework to real-world, highly dynamic environments remains speculative due to the controlled nature of the benchmark datasets utilized.

**Recommendations for Future Work:**

1. **Real-World Applications:** Future works should explore the application of PECTP in real-world scenarios where data arrives in a less structured or predictable manner than in the current experimental setup.

2. **Benchmark Expansion:** Including a broader range of datasets, especially in areas with significant domain shift or where tasks overlap, could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the framework's effectiveness.

3. **Exploration of Hardness Measures:** Incorporating explicit "hardness characterization" of tasks in the learning process might further refine the adaptability and performance of prompt-based strategies.

In conclusion, the paper provides a thoughtful and innovative approach to tackling CIL in memory-constrained environments. By focusing on parameter-efficient methods and a robust evaluation on diverse datasets, the authors contribute valuable insights into the incremental learning field. Addressing the noted areas could heighten the impact and applicability of this emerging framework.
