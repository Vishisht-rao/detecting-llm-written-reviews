Title: "Visual Prompting Reimagined: The Power of Activation Prompts"

**Summary and Contributions**:
The paper introduces a novel concept dubbed "activation prompt" (AP), designed to enhance visual prompting (VP) methodologies in adapting large pre-trained models to specialized vision tasks. This methodology moves beyond traditional input-level VP by incorporating perturbations directly into activation maps within intermediary model layers. The authors demonstrate that AP achieves superior performance and efficiency compared to VP by establishing its interplay with normalization tuning, particularly batch and layer normalization. Extensive experiments are conducted across 29 datasets with various architectures, showcasing that AP consistently outperforms VP in accuracy and computational efficiency.

**Strengths**:

1. **Novel Approach**: The introduction of an "activation prompt" is an innovative step beyond traditional VP, addressing inherent limitations of input-level perturbations.

2. **Thoroughness**: The paper presents comprehensive experiments on 29 datasets, providing a robust performance comparison between AP, VP, and several PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) methods.

3. **Theoretical Backing**: The paper offers a theoretical rationale for AP's superior performance, analyzed through the perspective of global feature extraction across model layers.

4. **Practical Impact**: Given the high efficiency in terms of parameters, memory, and computation, AP has significant implications for deploying pre-trained models on resource-constrained devices.

5. **Clear Insights**: The authors successfully clarify the weaknesses of traditional VP and detail the advantages that AP holds in various architectural contexts.

**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement**:

1. **Lack of Baseline Diversity**: While the paper thoroughly compares AP with input-level VP and some PEFT methods, it could benefit from comparisons with other "energy-based-models" and attention-based prompting approaches, if applicable, to provide a broader competitive landscape.

2. **Complexity of Theoretical Analysis**: The theoretical explanations, while insightful, require a deep understanding of normalization tuning and architecture-specific layer properties, which might be overly complex for readers new to the subject.

3. **Generalization to Other Modalities**: The paper focuses primarily on vision tasks. It would be interesting to explore whether AP could be effectively employed in other modalities like text or multimodal scenarios, further increasing its applicability.

4. **Potential for Overfitting**: While AP's reduced parameters are generally a strength, the risk of overfitting, especially in scarce data regimes, should be discussed further.

5. **Discussion on Pre-trained Model Size**: The paper briefly mentions AP's reliance on model size for accuracy. A more detailed analysis could provide deeper insights into its applicability across models of various scales.

**Clarity and Presentation**:

- The paper is well-organized, making a complex topic accessible. However, some sections of the theoretical analysis could benefit from simplification or additional intuitive explanations.
  
- Figures and tables effectively illustrate the empirical results, though more diagrams comparing architecture-specific differences in AP implementation would be beneficial.

**Conclusion**:
This paper presents a significant advance in the realm of visual prompting by transitioning from input to activation prompts. Its contributions to understanding and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of adaptation strategies for large pre-trained models are valuable. Despite some opportunities for enrichment in terms of theoretical simplification and broader applicability, the work is robust and holds promising implications for future research and practical applications in the fast-evolving field of pre-trained model deployment.
