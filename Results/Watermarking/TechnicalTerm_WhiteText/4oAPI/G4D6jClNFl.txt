### Review of "Deepfake Detection with Contrastive Learning in Curved Spaces"

#### Summary

The paper presents a novel method for detecting deepfakes termed CTru (Contrasted learning in opposite-curvature space), which leverages both hyperbolic and hyperspherical spaces to enhance the feature representation for facial images. The core innovation lies in representing facial geometry in multiple-curvature spaces, tackling the limitations of Euclidean assumptions in current deepfake detection methods. This approach integrates self-supervised learning with anomaly detection, primarily using pristine (real) face images during training. The detector achieves superior generalization capabilities across various datasets and manipulation techniques, establishing new state-of-the-art results. 

#### Strengths

1. **Novel Representation Learning**:
   - The utilization of diverse geometric spaces (hyperbolic and spherical) and integrating Busemann distance is innovative. This approach seems to robustly capture the complex geometrical properties of human faces and distinguishes them effectively from deepfakes.

2. **Strong Generalization**:
   - The proposed method outperforms contemporary methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation scenarios, suggesting it generalizes well to different forms of deepfakes and unseen data.

3. **Efficiency and Simplicity**:
   - The method doesn't rely on deep networks like ViT or even require access to fake examples for training, simplifying the training process while achieving noticeable speed in inference.

4. **Comprehensive Evaluation**:
   - The paper validates CTru's performance with extensive experiments, covering various scenarios and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, enhancing the credibility of the reported results.

5. **Robustness**:
   - The study includes robustness analysis against various perturbation methods, exhibiting consistent performance even under alterations.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Explanation of "Model Based Optimization"**:
   - The paper doesn't clearly mention or utilize "model based optimization," focusing more on representation learning techniques. Clarification on optimization strategies could enhance understanding.

2. **Complexity of Curved Spaces**:
   - While the approach leverages complex geometric spaces quite effectively, it introduces significant complexity in understanding and could benefit from more intuitive explanations or visual aids to convey the concepts clearly to a diverse audience.

3. **Applicability**:
   - The paper focuses heavily on the theoretical and technical framework. It might benefit from a discussion about real-world deployment challenges or computational resource requirements for real-time applications.

4. **Ablation Studies**:
   - The ablation study provides some insights into the individual components of the method (e.g., different loss functions), but further exploration of how each geometric space specifically contributes to fraud detection could be beneficial.

5. **Dependence on Prototypes**:
   - The reliance on evenly distributed prototypes for learning could imply constraints or limitations concerning scalability or adaptability to other domains, which isn't addressed in detail.

#### Conclusion

Overall, the paper presents a compelling contribution to deepfake detection, especially in tackling the geometric richness of human facial structures. The novel combination of hyperspherical and hyperbolic spaces alongside rigorous experimental validation places CTru as a significant advancement in the field. However, there is room for improvement in making the complex concepts more accessible and addressing potential limitations in real-world settings. Addressing these points will further strengthen the applicability and understanding of the proposed method.
