Title: Reducing Atomic Clashes in Geometric Diffusion Models for 3D Structure-Based Drug Design

Summary:
This paper addresses the problem of atomic clashes in the Geometric Diffusion Model (GDM) utilized for generating 3D molecular geometric structures in Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD). The authors propose a methodological enhancement to the existing sampling process, introducing a constrained sampling procedure using proximal regularization techniques. This method ensures adherence to physical constraints, reduces atomic clashes, and does not necessitate additional training of the GDM. The authors validate their approach through empirical evaluations, demonstrating a significant reduction in atomic clashes.

Strengths:
1. **Novelty**: The paper introduces an innovative constrained sampling process that tackles the issue of atomic clashes, a common challenge in data-driven GDMs.
2. **Empirical Evaluation**: The authors perform comprehensive evaluations on standard datasets (CrossDocked2020), showcasing a reduction in atomic clashes and maintaining model performance.
3. **Theoretical Foundation**: The use of proximal operators to handle non-smooth constraints is well-grounded, and convergence analysis is provided to support the proposed method's efficacy.
4. **Practicality**: The approach enhances the GDM without requiring retraining, making it practical for real-world applications.

Weaknesses:
1. **Complexity**: The presentation of the method might be overwhelming for readers without a strong mathematical background, particularly the integration of proximal operators and the convergence analysis.
2. **Visualization and Explanation**: While the paper includes visual representations and figures, they could be more intuitively explained, providing clearer insights into how proximal regularization mitigates clashes.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: The introduction of new metrics such as Clash Ratio and Stability is beneficial, but it might be useful to provide more context on how these metrics translate to real-world drug design applications.
4. **Generality**: Although the method demonstrated improvements on noted GDMs like TargetDiff, its adaptability and effectiveness need assessment across a broader range of models and datasets.

Suggested Improvements:
1. **Clarification of Concepts**: Simplifying or supplementing the explanation of key concepts such as proximal regularization and Langevin dynamics might broaden accessibility.
2. **Additional Comparisons**: Incorporating comparisons with alternative methods or benchmarks in managing atomic clashes could provide a more robust validation of the proposed approach.
3. **Future Directions**: Providing clearer future research directions or potential integrations with "interactive theorem proving" could highlight both the current study's significance and its implications for future advancements in drug design.

Overall, this paper contributes valuable insights and advancements in the realm of SBDD by addressing critical limitations of existing SOTA methods in handling molecular geometric representations, offering an approach that enhances reliability without necessitating additional model training.
