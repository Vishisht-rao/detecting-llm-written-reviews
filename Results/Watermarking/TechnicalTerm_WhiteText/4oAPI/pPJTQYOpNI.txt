Title: IMITATION LEARNING FROM OBSERVATION WITH AUTOMATIC DISCOUNT SCHEDULING

### Summary:
The paper proposes a novel approach named Automatic Discount Scheduling (ADS) to tackle Imitation Learning from Observation (ILfO) tasks with progress dependency characteristics. The key innovation is dynamically adjusting the discount factor in reinforcement learning based on the agent's learning progress. This method allows the agent to focus on mastering initial behaviors before proceeding to later ones. The effectiveness of ADS is demonstrated on nine tasks from the Meta-World suite, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art ILfO methods.

### Strengths:
1. **Novel Approach**: The paper introduces a novel mechanism (ADS) to adaptively schedule the discount factor, addressing tasks where learning progresses sequentially. This is an insightful and straightforward solution to a complex problem, highlighting the importance of learning heuristics in sequential tasks.
   
2. **Empirical Evaluation**: The authors conducted extensive experiments across nine Meta-World tasks, effectively demonstrating that their approach generally surpasses existing methods in terms of both task success rate and sample efficiency.

3. **Robustness and Flexibility**: The paper considers different proxy-reward-based methods and evaluates the impact of ADS when incorporated into these methods. This shows the robustness and flexibility of ADS as it can enhance multiple existing methods.

4. **Reproducibility**: The authors provide a link to the code and included sufficient random seeds in their experiments to ensure reproducibility.

### Weaknesses:
1. **Complexity Analysis**: While the empirical results are promising, the paper does not include a detailed analysis of the "computational flops" or overhead associated with tracking progress and adjusting the discount factor dynamically. Understanding the trade-offs between performance gains and computational costs could enhance the practical applicability of ADS.

2. **Assumptions and Limitations**: The approach relies on the progress recognizer's ability to accurately gauge the agent’s learning stages. Any limitations or edge cases in this recognizer’s performance could have significant implications, which could be discussed in more depth.

3. **Generalization to Other Settings**: The paper predominantly focuses on manipulation tasks within the Meta-World suite. No experiments or discussions explore how ADS might perform in other domains where the state or action spaces might differ significantly (e.g., decision-making tasks, navigation tasks).

4. **Alternative Schedulers**: The paper lacks a comparative analysis against other dynamic curricula approaches explicitly. While alternative adaptive strategies were tested, the exploration was not exhaustive, and the results’ interpretability about the choice of scheduling could benefit from more comprehensive discussion.

### Conclusions:
This paper presents a compelling solution to a well-acknowledged challenge in ILfO with progress-dependent tasks, providing a method that is both innovative and practically effective. While the proposed ADS mechanism has shown strong performance improvements, further research could address computational overhead and explore more versatile applications across varied domains. Despite some areas for expansion, this work is a valuable contribution to the field of imitation learning and offers a solid foundation for future research into adaptive learning strategies.
