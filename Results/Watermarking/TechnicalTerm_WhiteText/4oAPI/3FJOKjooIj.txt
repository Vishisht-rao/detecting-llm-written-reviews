The paper titled "SELF-SUPERVISED HETEROGENEOUS GRAPH LEARNING: A HOMOPHILY AND HETEROGENEITY VIEW," presents an innovative framework, HERO, for self-supervised learning in heterogeneous graphs. It addresses critical challenges in existing methods, such as the dependency on human-defined meta-paths and the underutilization of the graph's inherent heterogeneity.

### Summary

The authors propose a method that avoids pre-defined meta-paths by using a self-expressive matrix to capture homophily in the subspace and nearby neighbors. It also introduces a heterogeneous encoder to capture the heterogeneity from nodes of different types. The method incorporates a consistency loss to extract invariant information between homophily and heterogeneity, and a specificity loss to maintain their distinct task-related information in the latent space. Theoretical analyses are provided to support the grouping effect of the learned representations and the informational advantages of considering both homophily and heterogeneity. The experimental results on various tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to existing methods.

### Strengths

1. **Novelty and Contribution**: The paper makes significant strides in removing the need for predefined meta-paths, thus reducing expert knowledge dependency and the associated computational costs. The novel framework that simultaneously accounts for both homophily and heterogeneity is a substantial contribution.

2. **Theoretical Underpinning**: The authors provide thorough theoretical proofs, such as the grouping effect in Theorem 2.2 and the informational content of concatenated features in Theorem 2.3. This strengthens the credibility of their method.

3. **Experimental Validation**: Extensive experiments on multiple heterogeneous graph datasets and the inclusion of both node classification and similarity search tasks present a comprehensive evaluation. The method's performance aligns with its theoretical advantages.

4. **Scalability**: The analysis of HERO's time complexity suggests that it is computationally efficient and well-suited for large-scale applications, which is corroborated by its application on datasets like Freebase.

### Weaknesses

1. **Lack of Clarity on Feature-less Graphs**: While the paper relies on node features for calculating feature distances, it does not provide a solution for graphs that lack inherent node features, which could limit its applicability.

2. **Complexity of Understanding**: The introduction of multiple new mechanics and the dual-layered approach of integrating homophily and heterogeneity might render the paper complex to readers not deeply familiar with graph learning concepts.

3. **Parameter Sensitivity**: Although the paper reports comprehensive experimental results, it acknowledges the sensitivity of parameters such as γ, η, and λ, without giving detailed guidance on setting these parameters optimally across diverse scenarios.

### Suggested Improvements

1. **Exploration of Feature-less Nodes**: Future work could look into integrating methods that automatically construct features for nodes lacking them, potentially broadening the method's application scope.

2. **Parameter Tuning**: Including an empirical study or heuristic approaches to determine parameter settings across different datasets would make the framework more user-friendly.

Overall, the paper provides a substantial advancement in heterogeneous graph learning by effectively capturing homophily and heterogeneity without resorting to manually defined meta-paths. The proposed method, HERO, is theoretically well-founded and experimentally validated, making it a significant contribution to the field of graph representation learning. The few limitations mentioned open avenues for further research and refinement.
