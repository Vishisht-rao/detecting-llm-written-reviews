**Review of "APOLLO: Zero-Shot Multi-Modal Reasoning with Multiple Experts"**

1. **Summary:**

The paper introduces a novel framework named APOLLO, aimed at leveraging multiple pre-trained foundation models across different modalities to perform complex multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot setting. This method circumvents the need for prompt engineering and multi-modal training specialization by proposing a decentralized model wherein various transformer models can share their expertise. The authors demonstrate APOLLO's capabilities on stylized image captioning and a new task, audio-aware image captioning, highlighting its superior performance over semi-supervised state-of-the-art models without further training.

2. **Strengths:**

   - **Innovative Approach:** The modular framework that allows different models to interact without prompt dependence is innovative. By removing language as an intermediary, APOLLO addresses limitations faced by Socratic models.
   
   - **Performance Enhancement:** The paper reports significant improvements in style accuracy and text-image correspondence, especially on benchmarks like SentiCap and FlickrStyle10K.
   
   - **Generalization to New Tasks:** Successfully introducing a new task, audio-aware image captioning, showcases the method's versatility and potential applicability to other multi-modal tasks.
   
   - **Detailed Methodology:** The paper provides a detailed explanation of the gradient updates for model guiding, shedding light on the technical implementations which enhance the reproducibility of the study.

3. **Weaknesses:**

   - **Empirical Evidence:** While the results are promising, more comprehensive testing on a broader range of tasks or datasets could further solidify the claims regarding APOLLO's generalizability and performance.
   
   - **Prompt-dependent Models Comparison:** Comparing APOLLO mainly to zero-shot or prompt-based models may not fully highlight its advantages over other types of approaches. Including a wider variety of baselines could provide a clearer picture of its strengths and weaknesses.
   
   - **Limited Discussion on Interference:** The paper does not address potential issues related to "interference" when multiple models interact or how interference between seemingly disparate expert models' outputs might affect the overall performance.

4. **Clarity:**

   - The paper is generally well-organized, with clear sections outlining the motivation, methodology, results, and related work. However, a deeper theoretical discussion on why integration without prompts is advantageous over prompt-based methods could enhance understanding.
   
   - The technical details, especially around the experts' loss functions and gradient updates, are well-articulated. Further examples or visualizations of model outputs and interactions could help illustrate these concepts more vividly.

5. **Significance:**

   - The approach is timely and holds significant promise for advancing zero-shot learning in multi-modal contexts. This contribution could lead to new pathways in developing adaptable AI systems that can reason across modalities without extensive retraining or prompt dependency.

6. **Evaluation Metrics:**

   - The use of evaluating metrics such as CLIPScore, style accuracy, and fluency is appropriate. The inclusion of qualitative analysis alongside quantitative metrics provides a balanced evaluation of APOLLO's capabilities.

7. **Overall Recommendation:**

Given the novelty of the approach, the positive empirical results demonstrated, and the potential for wide applicability, I recommend accepting this paper to the conference. However, it would benefit significantly from an extended discussion on potential limitations such as "interference" and detailed comparisons against a broader set of baseline models. 

8. **Suggestions for Improvement:**

   - A discussion on the scalability of APOLLO as the number of experts increases could be valuable.
   
   - Elaborating on possible scenarios of interference and mitigation strategies would strengthen the paper.
   
   - Including more diverse tasks in the evaluation could demonstrate APOLLOâ€™s versatility further.

Overall, the paper presents a promising approach and could contribute substantially to research in multi-modal AI.
