### Title & Abstract:
The paper titled "FedJETs: Efficient Just-In-Time Personalization with Federated Mixture of Experts" introduces an innovative approach to enhancing federated learning (FL) by incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to achieve just-in-time personalization. The abstract clearly outlines the motivation and design of FedJETs, emphasizing its ability to handle non-homogeneous data distributions and improve state-of-the-art performance without additional labeled data or fine-tuning. The reported improvements (up to 18% in accuracy) sound promising, although these claims will need rigorous validation.

### Introduction:
The introduction effectively frames the challenges and motivations behind using MoEs within FL. It correctly identifies the scalability limitations of traditional monolithic models and suggests that specialized models can better utilize computational resources. The discussion regarding the "grandmother cell hypothesis" in neuroscience provides an intriguing perspective, though it could be connected more directly to the workings of machine learning models.

### Methodology:
The proposed FedJETs system is thoroughly detailed:
- **Mixture-of-Experts Design:** The integration of MoEs into the FL framework is a novel idea, and the explanation of using a pretrained common expert to guide the routing function is well-developed. It might benefit from a deeper explanation of how expert specialization aligns with the "grandmother cell hypothesis" conceptually.
- **Gating Function and Training Process:** The method of selecting and specializing experts using gated functions is clear. The introduction of anchor clients aids in stabilizing expert specialization, although the ratio between anchor and normal clients seems critical and possibly sensitive to dataset distribution—a point that could be explored further.
- **Privacy and Efficiency:** The paper claims privacy preservation due to non-need for additional labeled data and a reduction in communication costs, but this claims require quantification against baselines in diverse settings.

### Experiments:
- **Experimental Setup:** The experiments are solidly grounded in standard datasets like CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, with appropriate baselines for comparison. However, a broader range of datasets or tasks (e.g., in natural language processing) might better illustrate the method’s generalizability.
- **Results:** The increase in model accuracy for zero-shot personalization is noteworthy. The inclusion of multiple baselines like FedAvg, FedProx, and others provides robust context. However, the explanation of how these improvements translate in practical terms, e.g., resource consumption or deployment constraints, could be expanded.
- **Ablation Studies:** The ablation studies are commendably detailed, analyzing the impact of different initializations and configurations on performance. However, the cause-effect relationship between specific factors and outcome improvements could be more analytically developed.

### Recommendations:
1. **Clarify Theoretical Contributions:** While the practical advances are significant, a more thorough theoretical analysis of why MoEs coupled with FL outperform standard methods might be beneficial.
2. **Additional Datasets and Tasks:** Extending experiments to other domains could bolster claims about generalizability and robustness.
3. **Comparison Depth:** Providing deeper insights into the trade-offs between computational cost, communication efficiency, and personalization performance compared to existing FL approaches would be valuable.
4. **Discussion of Failure Cases:** Addressing scenarios where FedJETs might not perform well, or explicitly stating the limitations, could help balance the reader’s expectations.

### Presentation and Writing:
- The figures and tables are informative but could be better integrated into the narrative. More alignment between figures and the text discussing them would be helpful.
- The paper maintains a formal structure conducive to scientific communication. Minor proofreading could address any typographical errors or disjoint references.

Overall, the paper presents a compelling approach to improving federated learning through the innovative use of MoEs. With some enhancements in connecting theoretical insights to experimental results and exploring broader applicability, it has the potential to make a substantial impact in the field.
