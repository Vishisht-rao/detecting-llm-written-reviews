**Review of "Protein Language Models Enable Accurate Cryptic Ligand Binding Pocket Prediction"**

1. **Summary and Contributions**  
   The paper presents "Efficient Sequence-based cryptic Pocket prediction" (ESP), a novel approach leveraging Protein Language Models (PLMs) to predict cryptic ligand binding pockets with increased accuracy and computational efficiency. The authors claim significant improvements over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) ML-based cryptic pocket prediction algorithms, particularly PocketMiner, showing enhancements in predictive metrics such as ROCAUC (0.93 vs 0.87).

2. **Technical Soundness**  
   The approach is technically sound, aligning well with current trends of applying transformer-based architectures in the biological domain, evidenced by their success in natural language processing. Utilizing PLMs to bypass the need for extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations represents a significant advancement in reducing computational costs and time, addressing scalability issues associated with traditional methods.

3. **Experimental Methodology**  
   - The paper utilizes several PLMs, including Ankh-Large and ESM-2, for cryptic pocket identification.
   - The experiments are well-formulated, testing predictive efficacy using variations in sequence identity as a threshold, which demonstrates the model's generalization capacity.
   - The use of the PDBBind dataset to train ESP without focusing on cryptic-pocket-specific data enhances evidence of the model's robustness.

4. **Results and Comparisons**  
   - The comparison with PocketMiner is thorough, detailing specific cases where ESP provides clearer, spatially-focused predictions. The results presented in ROC and PR curves effectively demonstrate the improvement over SOTA.
   - However, the term "mixing rate" is not adequately explored in the context of comparing signal distribution of predictions, potentially an oversight in discussing convergence efficiencies or integration of dynamic protein behavior. 

5. **Clarity and Presentation**  
   The paper is mostly clear and logically structured, with sections that guide the reader through the background, methodology, results, and conclusions. Diagrams of protein structures showcasing prediction outcomes enhance comprehension. Despite this, the inclusion and detailed explanation of "mixing rate," if relevant to model assessment or comparison, would benefit the reader's understanding of temporal aspects in model prediction distribution.

6. **Relevance and Impact**  
   Identifying cryptic pockets is critical to drug discovery, and strategies that mitigate the need for cumbersome MD simulations are highly relevant. The ability to accurately predict these pockets from sequence data alone could meaningfully accelerate drug discovery timelines and resource allocation.

7. **Limitations and Future Work**  
   - The study could expand on addressing false-negative rates, as these have implications for prioritizing valid drug discovery targets.
   - The notion of integrating MD data with PLM outputs remains unexplored, yet it could propose an intriguing hybrid model for future improvement.

8. **Conclusion**  
   Overall, the paper presents a compelling advance in using PLMs for cryptic ligand binding pocket prediction, successfully demonstrating increased accuracy and efficiency compared to current SOTA methods. Some areas, such as the lack of discussion on the "mixing rate" and further exploration of dynamic protein features, could provide a more comprehensive picture of the model's capabilities and limitations. Nonetheless, this study is a noteworthy contribution to computational biology and drug design.
