**Review of the Paper: "NEURREV: TRAIN BETTER SPARSE NEURAL NETWORK PRACTICALLY VIA NEURON REVITALIZATION"**

**Summary:**
The paper proposes NeurRev, a framework aimed at improving Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) by addressing the issue of dormant neurons through a concept termed Neuron Revitalization. The key innovation is optimizing the often-overlooked pruning aspect within DST and reducing the prevalence of dormant neurons, thereby enhancing neuron learning efficiency. The results indicate that NeurRev achieves superior accuracy while significantly reducing system overhead and training time, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. Experiments are conducted across multiple datasets and network architectures to validate the proposed approach.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach:** The introduction of Neuron Revitalization offers a fresh perspective in the DST realm by tackling dormant neurons. Instead of focusing solely on traditional weight-growing strategies, the paper emphasizes the importance of effective pruning, which is often neglected.
  
2. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper presents thorough evaluations on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet) and network architectures (ResNet-32/34/50, VGG-19). This breadth provides robust evidence of the framework's effectiveness and versatility.
  
3. **System Level Suitability:** The focus on reducing system overhead and enhancing training speed aligns well with practical deployment needs, particularly on edge devices. This aspect is convincingly showcased with experiments on a mobile platform (Samsung Galaxy S21).

4. **Quantitative Demonstration of Improvements:** Empirical results demonstrate improvements in both accuracy and computational efficiency, supporting the claims. The inclusion of ablation studies further clarifies the impact of various hyperparameters.

5. **Software-Hardware Co-design Perspective:** The discussion around ReLU's prominence and the software-hardware integration provides a holistic view, addressing both algorithmic and practical deployment considerations.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Clarity in Explanation:** Some sections, especially concerning the detailed mechanisms behind dormant neurons’ identification and revitalization, could benefit from clearer explanations or visualizations. The reasons behind some design choices could be elaborated further.

2. **Comparison with More Baselines:** While the paper covers several existing methods, it would benefit from a broader comparison with state-of-the-art static sparse training techniques as well, to fully showcase NeurRev’s relative advantages and applicability.

3. **Lack of Theoretical Analysis:** The paper is largely empirical, which is essential, yet a theoretical examination of why NeurRev outperforms existing "primal algorithm" approaches in handling dormant neurons might provide deeper insights and strengthen the narrative.

4. **Potential Generalization:** Although results are promising, the paper focuses on specific network types (e.g., ReLU-based CNNs). Exploration or discussion of applicability to other network types or tasks would address concerns about generalization.

**Conclusion:**
The paper presents a compelling framework, NeurRev, that addresses a novel and impactful area within sparse neural network training. Its focus on dormant neurons and the practical benefits it offers, particularly for edge computing devices, are major contributions. Enhancements in clarity, broader baseline comparisons, and potential theoretical underpinnings could further elevate its impact and comprehensibility. However, as it stands, NeurRev appears to offer practical improvements over existing DST methodologies, making it a noteworthy contribution to the field.
