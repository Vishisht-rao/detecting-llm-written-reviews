Title: Benchmarks for Reinforcement Learning with Biased Offline Data and Imperfect Simulators

Review:

1. **Summary:**
   The paper addresses the prevalent issue in reinforcement learning (RL) of training agents using offline data and imperfect simulators. It outlines four primary challengesâ€”simulator modeling error, partial observability, state and action discrepancies, and confounding bias. To advance research in this domain, the authors propose the "Benchmarks for Mechanistic Offline Reinforcement Learning" (B4MRL), which consists of datasets and simulators designed to evaluate these challenges systematically. Additionally, they introduce a hybrid RL method, HyCORL, which combines offline data with imperfect simulators, and compare it with other existing RL approaches across various scenarios.

2. **Strengths:**
   - **Relevance:** The paper addresses critical issues in the RL domain where exploration in the real world is infeasible, making it highly relevant for real-world applications.
   - **Comprehensive Benchmarking:** The introduction of B4MRL is a significant contribution, providing a structured way to evaluate RL methods across key challenges in combining offline data with simulators.
   - **Empirical Evaluation:** The paper includes extensive experiments comparing various offline, online, and hybrid RL algorithms, providing valuable insights into their relative performance under different conditions.
   - **Clarity and Structure:** The paper is well-structured, with clearly defined sections outlining the motivation, challenges, benchmarks, and experimental results.

3. **Weaknesses:**
   - **Novelty of the Hybrid Approach:** While HyCORL is positioned as a novel approach, there is limited discussion on its uniqueness compared to existing hybrid RL methods. More emphasis on the specific innovations and theoretical underpinnings of HyCORL would strengthen the paper.
   - **Complexity of Confounding Bias:** The paper effectively describes the impact of confounding bias; however, the solutions proposed (i.e., benchmarks) focus more on evaluation rather than providing concrete methodologies to address confounding bias.
   - **Limited Theoretical Analysis:** The paper could benefit from more in-depth theoretical analysis of the proposed benchmarks and hybrid approach, such as discussing the "mixing rate" of hybrid RL algorithms mentioned for evaluation consistency.
   - **Scalability and Generalization:** The paper could expand on the discussion of the scalability and generalization of the proposed benchmarks and approach to different RL environments beyond those tested.

4. **Suggestions for Improvement:**
   - **Detailed Comparison:** Provide a more detailed comparison between HyCORL and existing hybrid algorithms, highlighting unique contributions.
   - **Methodological Advances:** Explore potential methodological advancements to counteract confounding bias, possibly drawing from causal inference methods.
   - **Theoretical Insights:** Incorporate a theoretical analysis of the hybrid combination strategies and "mixing rate" implications in hybrid RL.
   - **Broader Applications:** Test and discuss the applicability of B4MRL in broader and more diverse RL settings to demonstrate its versatility and practicality.

5. **Recommendation:**
   I recommend the paper for acceptance after minor revisions. It presents an important step in addressing key challenges in RL with offline and simulator data, backed by a solid experimental framework. Addressing the highlighted areas would further enhance its contribution to the field.
