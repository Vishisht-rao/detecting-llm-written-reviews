OUTPUT:
This paper addresses a critical and timely question in the context of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI): Can large language models (LLMs) infer causation from correlation? The study is innovative in its approach by introducing the novel task of correlation-to-causation inference, termed as CORR2CAUSE, which aims to assess the pure causal reasoning abilities of LLMs independently of empirical knowledge.

### Strengths:

1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The authors tackle an underexplored problem in the realm of AI and NLP. Existing research primarily focuses on leveraging empirical common-sense knowledge, while this study investigates formal causal reasoningâ€”a critical hallmark of human intelligence.

2. **Comprehensive Dataset**: The authors construct a large-scale dataset comprising over 200K samples, meticulously curated based on causal discovery frameworks like the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm. This dataset is vital for evaluating the causal inference capabilities of LLMs and can serve as a benchmark for future research.

3. **Thorough Evaluation**: The study evaluates a wide range of models, from BERT-based to more recent GPT versions (including GPT-4), providing a comprehensive analysis of current LLM capabilities in causal reasoning.

4. **Insightful Findings**: The results reveal a significant shortcoming in existing LLMs' capabilities to perform causal inference, showing performance close to random guessing. Moreover, this deficiency persists even after fine-tuning, highlighting a lack of generalization, particularly in out-of-distribution settings.

5. **Future Directions**: The paper provides clear suggestions for future research, including the exploration of larger graphs and the incorporation of "hidden confounding" to create more challenging datasets. This could lead to significant improvements in developing more robust AI systems capable of reasoned decision-making.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Baseline and Evaluation Concerns**: While the empirical results indicate poor performance of LLMs in causal reasoning, the choice of evaluation metrics could be expanded. For instance, incorporating specialized causal inference metrics might provide deeper insights.

2. **Grounding in Real-World Scenarios**: While the paper includes a section on extending to natural stories, the practical application of this dataset remains somewhat abstract. Providing more examples or case studies demonstrating real-world applicability could enhance the paper's impact.

3. **Complexity and Scalability**: The authors acknowledge the current limitation of graphs with 2 to 6 nodes. Exploring scalability to larger, more complex causal graphs remains a vital future direction, which the paper only briefly touches upon.

4. **Potential Solutions**: While identifying the problem is crucial, the paper could be improved by providing more concrete strategies or methodologies to address these identified shortcomings in LLMs.

### Conclusion:

The paper presents a foundational step in exploring the causal reasoning capabilities of LLMs, an aspect crucial for advancing AI systems' decision-making abilities. While it highlights significant gaps in current models, it lays a strong foundation for future work in enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities beyond empirical knowledge databases. The proposed dataset and task are valuable contributions to the NLP community, opening new avenues for research with practical implications in developing more intelligent AI systems.
