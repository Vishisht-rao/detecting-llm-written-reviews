**Review of "DeepDRK: Deep Dependency Regularized Knockoff for Feature Selection"**

**Summary**

The paper introduces Deep Dependency Regularized Knockoff (DeepDRK), a deep learning-based feature selection method that aims to control the false discovery rate (FDR) while optimizing for selection power. Built upon the Model-X knockoff framework, DeepDRK leverages a transformer-based generative model to generate knockoffs, which purportedly satisfy the swap property better than existing methods. The authors introduce novel regularization techniques, including a multi-swapper adversarial training procedure and dependency regularization based on sliced-Wasserstein metrics, to reduce reconstructability. Experiments on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets suggest that DeepDRK outperforms existing deep learning-based knockoff methods, especially in cases of small sample size and complex data distributions.

**Strengths**

1. **Innovative Approach**: The use of transformer architectures in generating knockoffs is novel and leverages recent advances in deep learning for better capturing dependencies.

2. **Focus on Reconstructability**: The paper addresses the issue of reconstructability, which is an important factor in feature selection power, especially in high-dimensional settings.

3. **Robust Evaluation**: The proposed method is tested on a variety of datasets, including synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world data, providing a comprehensive evaluation of performance.

4. **Detailed Analysis**: The paper provides a thorough exploration of the theoretical background, methodology, and experimental setup, along with detailed appendices offering further insights.

**Weaknesses**

1. **Complexity**: The introduction of multiple new components, such as multi-swapper adversarial training and sliced-Wasserstein-based metrics, increases the complexity. While each component is individually justified, the combination may present significant training overhead and could potentially complicate reproducibility and practical implementation.

2. **Baseline Comparison**: Although the paper compares DeepDRK against several state-of-the-art methods, it does not explicitly mention if traditional statistical methods or simpler knockoff mechanisms were included as baselines. This could provide a more rounded view of the relative performance gain.

3. **Quantitative Interpretability**: While the paper discusses dependency regularization, more intuition could be provided on how specific regularization strengths affect the FDR and power trade-off empirically.

4. **Absence of "Mirror Prox"**: The paper does not mention the term "mirror prox," which could be relevant if discussing optimization techniques related to game theory frameworks or adversarial training.

**Clarity**

- The paper is generally well-written, with a logical structure and clear explanations of most concepts. However, the authors assume reader familiarity with advanced topics in statistical learning and optimal transport, which could be challenging for less experienced readers.

- The figures and tables are well-utilized for illustrating results and performance metrics.

**Recommendations**

1. **Simplify where possible**: Consider simplifying the framework or clearly distinguishing core components from additional enhancements to make the proposed method more accessible.

2. **Additional Baselines**: Include traditional and more straightforward models in the baseline comparison to highlight the true value added by DeepDRK.

3. **Theoretical Insights**: Expand on the theoretical insights concerning the regularization techniques employed, potentially providing bounds or guarantees if possible.

4. **Broader Impact and Limitations**: Discuss potential application domains thoroughly, alongside a candid assessment of limitations, particularly regarding computational requirements.

In conclusion, DeepDRK presents a promising direction for feature selection under the Model-X knockoff framework. It effectively utilizes modern machine learning techniques to address challenges related to complex data distributions and small sample sizes. With some refinements and broader comparisons, it could offer substantial contributions to the field of feature selection.
