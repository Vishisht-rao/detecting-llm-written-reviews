**Review of "ODEFormer: Symbolic Regression of Dynamical Systems with Transformers"**

This paper presents ODEFormer, a novel Transformer-based model for symbolic regression of multidimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs) from observed trajectory data. The authors claim this to be the first Transformer capable of inferring ODE systems in symbolic form, offering improved robustness to noisy and irregularly sampled observations over existing methods. They evaluate ODEFormer on two datasets: the "Strogatz" dataset and a newly introduced "ODEBench" dataset, which consists of a diverse collection of ODEs from one to four dimensions.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Scope:** The introduction of ODEFormer and its application to symbolic regression of ODEs is a significant advancement. The model's ability to handle multidimensional systems is an important capability that distinguishes it from prior work primarily focusing on simpler or univariate systems.

2. **Robustness:** The evaluations demonstrate that ODEFormer is more robust to noise and irregular sampling compared to existing methods. This robustness is crucial for real-world applications where data is often imperfectly collected.

3. **Scalability and Performance:** The authors conduct extensive evaluations showing that ODEFormer consistently outperforms other approaches, with faster inference times and lower complexity in the symbolic expressions it generates. These aspects are well illustrated through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies.

4. **Dataset Contribution:** The introduction of "ODEBench" addresses the limitations of the "Strogatz" dataset by providing a more holistic benchmark comprising a wider array of real-world dynamic systems. This contribution is valuable for the research community for future benchmarking efforts.

5. **Practical Considerations:** The paper outlines practical implementations, such as handling different scales of initial conditions through an affine rescaling mechanism during inference. The optional parameter optimization step to refine constants post-prediction is another practical enhancement.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limitations in Chaotic Systems:** Despite successfully handling a range of dynamic systems, ODEFormer struggles with chaotic systems, as seen in the ODEBench evaluation. Addressing these limitations in future work would be beneficial, especially given the significance of chaotic systems in modeling complex real-world phenomena.

2. **Handling of Unobserved Variables:** The current model requires all variables to be observed, which may not always be feasible in many real-world scenarios. The authors mention this as a potential future direction, but addressing this could substantially increase the model's applicability.

3. **Scalability with Higher Dimensions and Orders:** Although ODEFormer can handle up to four-dimensional systems, its scalability to higher-dimensional or non-first-order ODEs remains unexplored in this work. Future exploration into this area could provide insights into extending the model's capabilities further.

4. **Generality and Real-world Application:** While the results on synthetic data and curated benchmarks are promising, it would be beneficial to see applications to real-world datasets or collaborations with domain experts to validate the method's utility in practical settings.

**Discussion and Future Directions:**

The paper appropriately acknowledges its limitations and outlines interesting directions for future research, including the potential adaptation of the model to higher-order or partial/stochastic differential equations. Furthermore, developing methods to handle trajectories with unobserved variables through techniques like masking, as mentioned by the authors, could greatly enhance the utility of ODEFormer.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, "ODEFormer: Symbolic Regression of Dynamical Systems with Transformers" is a well-executed study that pushes the boundaries of applying Transformer models to the challenging task of symbolic regression in dynamical systems. Its contributions to model architecture, benchmark datasets, and experimentations underline its relevance and potential in advancing both theoretical and practical aspects of symbolic regression. The paper fits well within the scope of accelerating scientific discovery through modern machine learning methods, as it alludes to recent triumphs in the field, citing references like Davies et al. (2021), Jumper et al. (2021), and Degrave et al. (2022).

In conclusion, the paper makes significant strides in the symbolic regression of dynamical systems, and the authors have successfully opened up several avenues for future exploration in the field. The integration of "nlp; recursive neural network; multi-grain representation; compositional representation; span labeling; relation extraction; grammar induction; language understanding" in such a sophisticated model as ODEFormer reflects the broader trend of utilizing advanced neural network architectures for complex scientific tasks.
