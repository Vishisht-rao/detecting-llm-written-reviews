Review of "ADAM THROUGH A SECOND-ORDER LENS"

Summary:
The paper presents a novel optimizer called AdamQLR, which integrates techniques from both first-order and second-order optimization methods. The core idea is to enhance the Adam optimizer's capability by incorporating learning rate selection and damping strategies from the K-FAC (Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature) method. This new approach intends to offer a balance between computational efficiency and optimization accuracy that stands out against traditional first-order and quasi-Newton methods. The authors provide an empirical evaluation across a variety of tasks and datasets to validate the performance of AdamQLR.

Strengths:
1. **Innovation**: The approach of combining first-order and second-order optimization techniques is compelling, as it seeks to harness the benefits of both worlds in a unified framework.
2. **Empirical Evaluation**: The paper includes an extensive set of experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of AdamQLR across different datasets and tasks, highlighting its robustness and competitive performance against well-tuned benchmarks.
3. **Broad Applicability**: The proposed method is applicable to a wide range of machine learning problems, including regression and classification tasks. The scalability of AdamQLR to different problem sizes is a notable strength.
4. **Hyperparameter Robustness**: The claim that the untuned version of AdamQLR can compete with hyperparameter-tuned baselines is well-supported by the reported results, offering a practical advantage for users seeking to minimize tuning efforts.

Weaknesses:
1. **Complexity of Implementation**: While the algorithm is presented as a simple wrapper around Adam, the actual implementation details, particularly those around using the Fisher matrix, might be complex for practitioners less familiar with second-order methods.
2. **Evaluation on Large-Scale Problems**: While experiments on datasets like CIFAR-10 offer insights, the paper could benefit from a more thorough evaluation on larger-scale datasets, such as ImageNet, to better gauge scalability and computational efficiency in large-scale settings. The brief assessment on ImageNet hinted at limitations of the current approach.
3. **Comparison with Other Second-Order Methods**: Although the paper compares AdamQLR with K-FAC, other second-order methods, especially in reinforcement learning (for instance, those involving "regularization in reinforcement learning") are not considered. This could offer a more comprehensive view of its position in the optimization landscape.

Discussion Points:
- **Learning Rate Adaptation**: The decision to include learning rate adaptation inspired by second-order methods is a central claim, yet the discussion around its potential pitfalls or scenarios where it might not perform as well is somewhat limited. Further exploration into the conditions or limitations where this adaptation could fail would be insightful.
- **Stability Versus Speed**: The paper balances the stability provided by second-order methods with the speed of first-order methods. However, the trade-offs between stability, speed, and memory consumption (noted as an approximate fourfold increase over SGD) might warrant further discussion, especially regarding practical deployment considerations.
- **Theoretical Justification**: While empirical results are promising, there seems to be a lack of theoretical insights concerning why and how the combined features of AdamQLR lead to superior performance. A deeper theoretical exploration could augment the empirical findings.

Conclusion:
"ADAM THROUGH A SECOND-ORDER LENS" presents a meaningful contribution to the domain of optimization for deep learning. The innovative integration of first-order and second-order techniques offers a promising direction for developing efficient yet powerful optimizers. The robustness claims, backed by extensive experiments, make AdamQLR an attractive tool for machine learning practitioners, although further exploration into its theoretical and large-scale applications could enhance its impact.
