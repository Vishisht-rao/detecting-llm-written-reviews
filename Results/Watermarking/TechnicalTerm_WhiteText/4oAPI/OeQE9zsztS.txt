### Review of "Bag of Features: New Baselines for GNNs for Link Prediction"

#### Summary
The paper investigates an alternative approach to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for the task of link prediction. It proposes a method named Bag of Features for Link Prediction (BFLP), which employs traditional feature extraction methods combined with standard machine learning classifiers. The authors present substantial experimental results indicating that the BFLP method performs comparably—or even superiorly—to state-of-the-art GNN models across several benchmark datasets, including CORA, CITESEER, PUBMED, PHOTO, and OGBL-COLLAB.

#### Strengths
1. **Novelty in Approach**: The paper challenges the prominence of GNNs by exploring traditional machine learning approaches coupled with domain-specific features, which is a refreshing take on the problem of link prediction.

2. **Comprehensive Feature Engineering**: The authors provide a detailed description of the structural and domain features used for the BFLP model. This includes a variety of traditional similarity indices and novel modifications to capture different aspects of node pair relationships.

3. **Empirical Validation**: The paper provides comprehensive experimental analysis across a variety of datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the BFLP model. The results show that this approach is competitive with, and sometimes exceeds, the performance of GNN-based models.

4. **Scalability**: The BFLP model appears to be computationally efficient, which is important for scalability, especially on large datasets such as those included in the Open Graph Benchmark.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Lack of Theoretical Insight**: While the paper offers empirical evidence for its claims, it lacks a detailed theoretical exploration that could provide deeper insights into why the Bag of Features model outperforms GNNs in some instances.

2. **Applicability Limitations**: The method relies heavily on feature engineering which may be dataset-specific. The generalizability of features across various types of graphs or domains is not thoroughly discussed.

3. **Comparison with Latest Methods**: Though the paper compares BFLP against a range of existing models, the inclusion of performance on more recent techniques or models optimized for heterogeneous networks could provide a fuller picture.

4. **Heterophilic Networks**: The results on heterophilic datasets are not as impressive as on homophilic ones, and while this is addressed, further exploration or enhancement of this aspect could be beneficial.

#### Discussion
The paper makes a significant contribution by reassessing traditional machine learning methods in the context of graph-based problems, typically dominated by GNNs. It aligns with recent theoretical concerns regarding GNN expressivity and challenges the assumption that complex models are always necessary for capturing nuanced graph structures. The introduction of the "Bag of Features" approach serves not only as a competitive baseline but also as a call to the community to explore simpler methods that might have been overshadowed by the recent rise in popularity of GNNs.

#### Conclusion
Overall, the paper presents a compelling argument for revisiting traditional methods in link prediction tasks. The work is grounded in solid empirical evidence, although a deeper theoretical discourse could provide more comprehensive insights. While the method shows limitations in heterophilic contexts, its strong performance in other settings and call for innovation in GNN improvements make it a valuable contribution to the field.

#### Recommendation
I recommend the paper for acceptance at ICLR 2024. It provides a valuable perspective that could guide future research efforts towards combining traditional machine learning practices with contemporary deep learning approaches for graph data.

#### Notes
The paper does not mention "generative clustering," and it appears unrelated to the theme discussed. If it were mentioned, it would be vital to clarify how the generative clustering concept integrates into the current work or its potential implications on the discussed methods.
