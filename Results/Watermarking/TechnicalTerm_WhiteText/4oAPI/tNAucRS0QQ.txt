**Review of "GENERAL-PURPOSE PRE-TRAINED MODEL TOWARDS CROSS-DOMAIN MOLECULE LEARNING"**

**Summary:**
The authors propose BIT (Biomolecular Interaction Transformer), a general-purpose foundation model for biomolecular interaction tasks. BIT aims to bridge the gap in current molecular pre-training methods by accommodating both small molecule and protein data, including protein-ligand complexes, using a unified Transformer framework. BIT implements a Mixture-of-Domain-Experts (MoDE) to exploit domain specificity in biochemical inputs. The pre-training involves multiple self-supervised tasks, focusing on 2D and 3D molecular data. BIT has been evaluated across several downstream tasks, showcasing its superior performance in binding affinity prediction, virtual screening, and molecular property prediction.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Contribution:** The introduction of BIT provides a new approach to simultaneously managing multiple biochemical entities within one model architecture. BIT’s capability of unifying 2D and 3D data formats via shared self-supervised learning objectives is an impressive effort towards cross-domain learning, adding value to both academic and industrial applications like drug discovery.

2. **Experimental Rigor:** The authors extensively evaluate BIT on standard benchmarks, including the PDBbind dataset for binding affinity prediction, DUD-E for virtual screening, and MoleculeNet for molecular properties. BIT consistently demonstrates superior performance compared to existing models, showing its potential as a generalizable tool across various domains.

3. **Mechanistic Insight:** The paper well-articulates the MoDE mechanism and its integration with the Transformer-M backbone. The approach of routing atom tokens to domain-specific experts while maintaining a shared attention mechanism seems effective in capturing both intra-domain and inter-domain molecular interactions.

4. **Pre-training Strategy:** Leveraging self-supervised learning objectives across 3D protein-ligand complexes and large-scale 2D/3D small molecules appears to be an effective strategy, especially with tasks like coordinate denoising and masked token denoising, ensuring robust and transferable feature representations.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity and Computational Cost:** While the model's design is innovative, its complexity and resource requirements (e.g., training BIT on 64 V100 GPUs over two days) can limit accessibility and reproducibility, particularly for smaller labs or organizations with restricted computational resources.

2. **Clarity and Readability:** The paper, at times, becomes highly technical without sufficient contextual explanations, especially in sections describing structural channels, MoDE, and the fine-tuning process. Greater clarity could be provided on how the mixture-of-experts mechanism interacts with the model's learning capability across different domains.

3. **Limited Discussion on "Information Theory":** Despite the paper's association with potential information-theoretic concepts, like contrastive learning and corruption-based recovery tasks, it does not explore or elaborate on these connections in the context of information theory, which could provide a deeper theoretical framework for BIT’s architecture.

4. **Exclusion of Alternative Methods:** The authors mention that BIT exceeds state-of-the-art methods but do not provide an exhaustive comparison that includes non-Transformer architectures, which could further validate their claims of superiority.

5. **Generalization to Other Tasks:** While BIT is shown to excel in tasks pertinent to molecular interactions, the lack of discussion on its generalization to other biochemical scenes (beyond proteins and small molecules, like nucleic acids) could be addressed. Moreover, potential challenges in integrating other forms of biological data into BIT remain unexplored.

**Conclusion:**
The paper presents a pioneering approach in the field of biomolecular interactions with the development of BIT. It sets a substantial precedent for future research in cross-domain molecular learning. However, clarity in complex mechanisms, computational accessibility, and broader applicability of BIT should be addressed for its full potential to be realized. Engaging more deeply with "information theory" might also offer robust theoretical insights to future iterations of this work.
