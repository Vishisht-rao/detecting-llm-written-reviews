**Title**: Estimating Uncertainty from Feed-forward Network Based Sensing Using Quasi-Linear Approximation

**Summary**: The authors of this paper address a key challenge in using neural networks for sensing in safety-critical environments: estimating real-time confidence. They propose an innovative methodology that leverages quasilinear approximation, adapted from control engineering, to propagate dynamics of environmental uncertainty through neural networks. This approach facilitates the integration of neural network-based sensing with Bayesian (Kalman-style) filtering, enabling "real-time detection" of uncertainty in high-dimensional networks without the computational load of sampling-based methods.

**Strengths**:

1. **Novel Approach**: The introduction of a quasilinear approximation to estimate uncertainty in neural networks is a novel step forward. This methodology is well-formulated and appears, at least theoretically, to overcome some of the limitations inherent in Jacobian linearization and nonlinear sampling-based approaches.

2. **Relevance**: With the increasing use of neural networks in safety-critical applications, the ability to estimate uncertainty accurately and in real-time is crucial. The paper demonstrates an awareness of the broader context and importance of the proposed solution.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The authors conduct extensive experiments, both on a controlled approximation accuracy setting and in a simulated target-tracking application, demonstrating the potential improvements in predictability and computational efficiency.

4. **Integration with Kalman Filtering**: By marrying the proposed approximation method with Kalman filtering, the authors provide a practical method that can be readily applied in scenarios requiring continuous monitoring and decision-making.

**Weaknesses**:

1. **Complexity and Assumptions**: The proposed approach, while innovative, relies on several assumptions, such as Gaussian noise and certain forms of activation functions (e.g., tanh, softplus, ReLU). It would be helpful to discuss the scenarios where these assumptions might break down and the performance implications.

2. **Limited Scope of Results**: While the improvement over existing methods is demonstrated, the practical impact of this methodology in large-scale, real-world scenarios remains to be validated. The simulated environment, although useful for proof-of-concept, may not capture the full complexity of dynamic real-world applications.

3. **Lack of Comparative Baseline**: The comparison primarily focuses on Jacobian and proposed SL methods. It would be valuable to include a broader baseline comparison, possibly with other state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation frameworks, to contextualize the performance improvements.

4. **Clarity of Presentation**: The mathematical formulations are dense and might benefit from additional explanatory text to ensure comprehension by a wider audience including those less familiar with control theory.

5. **Scalability Concerns**: Although the proposed method can outperform sampling-based approaches in terms of computational efficiency, thereâ€™s limited discussion on how this scales as network architectures grow larger or more complex.

**Conclusion**: The paper presents a promising method for real-time uncertainty estimation in neural network-based sensing systems, with potential broad applications in safety-critical domains. However, further empirical testing and clarity in presenting methodology would strengthen its contributions. If successful in practical scenarios, this work could significantly impact how uncertainty is treated in systems relying heavily on neural network-based data processing.
