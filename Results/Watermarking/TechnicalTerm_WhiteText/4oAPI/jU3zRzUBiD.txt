**Title:** Compensating for Nonlinear Reduction with Linear Computations in Private Inference

**Summary:**

The paper presents "Seesaw," a novel neural architecture search (NAS) method designed for privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML). The primary goal of Seesaw is to enhance PPML's performance by reducing the computational cost associated with nonlinear operations, which are typically resource-intensive when secured through cryptographic methods. By strategically increasing linear computations and reusing the outputs of existing nonlinear operations, Seesaw aims to mitigate the accuracy loss caused by the reduction of nonlinear components. The approach introduces a new design space with sampling and aggregation blocks that prioritize linear operations while effectively reusing nonlinear outputs, ultimately pushing the Pareto frontier in terms of accuracy versus computational cost.

**Strengths:**

1. **Relevance and Timeliness:** The topic is of high significance due to growing concerns over data privacy in machine learning. The paper addresses a critical challenge in PPML by seeking efficient trade-offs between accuracy and computational overhead.
   
2. **Innovative Approach:** Seesaw's integration of additional linear operations and efficient reuse of nonlinear results is a novel and promising direction for optimizing PPML systems.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper provides thorough evaluations using datasets like CIFAR100 and ImageNet, showing Seesaw's competitive edge compared to state-of-the-art methods.

4. **Detailed Methodology:** The newly introduced concepts, such as the sampling and aggregation blocks and the pruning techniques, are well-detailed, aiding in understanding their contribution to the overall performance improvements.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity of Implementation:** The proposed method involves substantial architectural changes and may require significant computational resources and expertise to implement effectively, which the paper does not fully address.

2. **Generality of Results:** While the paper shows compelling results, these are primarily demonstrated on image classification tasks. It would strengthen the work's impact to include additional application domains or explicitly discuss the method's adaptability to various tasks.

3. **Comparative Limitations:** The paper could benefit from a deeper exploration of why Seesaw achieves better performance than SENet and SNL, especially regarding the "spatio-temporal grounding" of its methodology, since this aspect seems unaddressed.

4. **Scalability Concerns:** Although Seesaw is shown to reduce ReLU operations effectively, the paper lacks a discussion on how well the method scales with significantly larger models or datasets beyond the mentioned benchmarks.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Broader Evaluation:** Consider extending experiments to additional domains and tasks to verify the general applicability of Seesaw.

2. **Implementation Insights:** Provide more practical insights or guidelines on implementing Seesaw in real-world scenarios, possibly including a reference implementation or open-source code.

3. **Clarify "Spatio-Temporal Grounding":** If relevant, elaborating on how Seesaw addresses or benefits from spatio-temporal grounding could enhance clarity and breadth of understanding regarding its application to dynamic or sequential data.

4. **Scalability Tests:** Include tests on larger models/datasets to demonstrate the robustness and scalability of Seesaw, or discuss potential strategies to handle such scenarios.

Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of PPML by addressing a critical bottleneck in current systems with an innovative and effective approach. However, clarifying certain aspects and expanding evaluations could further increase its impact and utility.
