**Review of "Counterfactual Density Estimation Using Kernel Stein Discrepancies"**

**Summary:**
The paper proposes a novel approach for modeling counterfactual distributions using Kernel Stein Discrepancies (KSD) within a doubly robust framework. It tackles a crucial challenge in causal inference: effectively estimating the full distribution of potential outcomes (counterfactuals) beyond mean effects. By minimizing KSD between a parametric class of distributions and the counterfactual distribution, while incorporating double robustness against sampling bias, the authors offer a method that does not necessitate known normalizing constants for probability density functions. The paper provides theoretical analyses demonstrating the consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator and evaluates its empirical performance through simulation studies.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty and Scope**: The paper addresses a significant gap in counterfactual distribution estimation by introducing a method that accommodates densities known only up to normalization constant. This covers a wide range of models, particularly energy-based models, which are typically challenging due to their intractable normalizing constants.

2. **Theoretical Contributions**: The authors present sufficient conditions for the consistency and asymptotic normality of their estimator. The incorporation of double robustness is well-explained and theoretically justified within the procedure, a crucial advantage when dealing with bias in treatment assignment.

3. **Comprehensive Analysis**: The paper includes rigorous proofs for its theoretical claims, offering mathematical depth and a solid foundation for its results. The effective use of cross-validation ensures that the novelty does not come at the cost of practical applicability.

4. **Empirical Validation**: Several experiments using synthetic and semi-synthetic data illustrate the estimator’s performance. The paper also cleverly uses the MNIST dataset to simulate real-world scenarios, showcasing potential applications.

5. **Interest in Causal Inference Community**: The approach could prove highly beneficial for practitioners in causal inference interested in distributional effects rather than merely average treatment effects.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Computational Complexity**: While the authors mention the O(n²) complexity of evaluating gn, there is limited discussion about mitigating this for large datasets. In many practical scenarios, real-time calculations or very large datasets are common, and addressing this concern could enhance the method's applicability.

2. **Optimization Challenges**: Despite acknowledging non-convex optimization challenges, the authors do not provide a detailed strategy for overcoming these when estimating parameters θ, particularly in high-dimensional spaces.

3. **Empirical Comparisons**: The paper claims that no direct competitors exist for estimating unnormalized densities in the counterfactual setting. While this may be true, a comparison with existing density estimation methods (even if indirect) could provide readers with a clearer understanding of the advantages introduced by this method.

4. **Assumptions and Scope**: While the authors provide sufficient conditions for their theoretical results, there is limited discussion on the practical plausibility of these assumptions in real-world applications, which could inform readers about potential limitations.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of causal inference by innovatively extending kernel methods to model counterfactual densities without requiring normalizing constants. Its robust theoretical framework, combined with experimental validation, suggests it could significantly impact how counterfactual modeling is approached. However, attention to computational scalability and practical optimization strategies would enhance its application potential. The paper is well-suited for ICLR 2024, promoting cross-disciplinary interest in applying modern machine learning techniques to classical statistical problems.
