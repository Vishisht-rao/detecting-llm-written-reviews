## Review: Structured Packing in LLM Training Improves Long Context Utilization

This paper tackles a critical issue in long-context language models (LCLMs): the underutilization of extended context. The authors convincingly argue that the lack of long-range semantic dependencies in typical training data is a significant bottleneck. They propose a novel approach, SPLICE (Structured Packing for Long Context), which leverages retrieval methods to construct training examples containing multiple related documents.  The paper presents a strong empirical validation of SPLICE, demonstrating improved perplexity and downstream task performance.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses an important problem:** The paper focuses on a relevant and timely problem in the field of LCLMs, namely, poor context utilization despite large context windows.
*   **Clear and well-motivated approach:** The authors clearly articulate the rationale behind SPLICE and provide compelling intuition for its effectiveness. The connection to work on retrieval-augmented language models and dependency density is well-established.
*   **Novel method:** SPLICE is a novel and interesting method for creating training examples that promotes long-range dependency learning. The tree-based construction and flexible parameterization (k) are strengths.
*   **Strong empirical results:** The paper presents a comprehensive set of experiments across multiple datasets (code, WebText) and model sizes (270M, 3B, 7B).  The results consistently demonstrate that SPLICE outperforms the baseline, particularly on tasks requiring long-context understanding. The ablation study on SPLICE parameters is also valuable.
*   **General applicability:** The paper effectively demonstrates the general applicability of SPLICE, unlike methods that rely on dataset-specific structure (e.g., repository-level code data). The results showing improved performance even on non-code datasets after training on code using SPLICE are particularly compelling.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors provide sufficient details about the data preparation, model architecture, and training procedure, including pseudocode for SPLICE and code in supplementary materials, which enhances the reproducibility of their work.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Retrieval Quality:** The paper acknowledges that the success of SPLICE hinges on the quality of the retrieval method. While BM25 and Contriever-MSMARCO are reasonable choices, a more thorough investigation of different retrieval strategies and their impact on model performance would be beneficial.  Specifically, the paper mentions that BM25 is not guaranteed to return semantically related documents. This concern could be allayed with analysis of the similarity of the retrieved documents and how it relates to the final performance.
*   **Limited Analysis of "Adaptive Moving Mesh":** The paper does not explore the use of "**adaptive moving mesh**" techniques to dynamically allocate computational resources during long-context processing, potentially leading to inefficiencies.
*   **Parameter Tuning and Data Mixtures:** The results with StackExchange are promising, but the paper suggests that better data mixtures could further improve performance. A systematic study of different data mixtures and their impact on performance across different tasks would strengthen the paper.
*   **Scaling Limitations:** The paper acknowledges limitations in scaling the context length and model size. While the results with a 7B model are encouraging, further experiments with larger models and longer contexts are needed to fully assess the potential of SPLICE.
*   **Context Extension Methodology:** While the paper shows that SPLICE works with various context extension methods, the analysis of the interaction between SPLICE and different extension techniques could be more extensive. A deeper dive into how SPLICE complements or interacts with the specific inductive biases of each method would be valuable.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Retrieval Method Analysis:** Include a more detailed analysis of the retrieval quality of BM25 and Contriever-MSMARCO, potentially with visualizations or metrics that quantify the semantic relatedness of retrieved documents. Consider exploring other retrieval methods, particularly those designed for semantic similarity.
*   **Data Mixture Experiments:** Conduct a more systematic study of different data mixtures and their impact on model performance. Explore techniques for optimizing the data mixture based on task-specific requirements.
*   **Scaling Experiments:** Perform experiments with larger models and longer context lengths, if computationally feasible. This would provide a better understanding of the scaling properties of SPLICE.
*    **Include a discussion of "adaptive moving mesh"** techniques, or at least acknowledge this aspect of computational resource allocation during long-context processing.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach for improving long-context utilization in LLMs. The empirical results are compelling, and the method has broad applicability. Addressing the limitations and suggestions outlined above would further strengthen the paper. I recommend acceptance, pending minor revisions.
