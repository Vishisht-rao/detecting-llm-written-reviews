## Review of "IMPROVING GENERALIZATION FOR MISSING DATA IMPUTATION VIA DUAL CORRUPTION DENOISING AUTOENCODERS"

This paper proposes a novel approach, Dual Corruption Denoising AutoEncoders (DC-DAE), for missing data imputation. The core idea revolves around augmenting inputs with dual corruptions (masking and noise) during training and utilizing a balanced loss function to control reconstruction versus denoising. The paper argues that this approach improves generalization by preventing reliance on fixed missingness patterns. The empirical results presented on multiple tabular datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to GAN, DAE, and VAE baselines under various missingness scenarios.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The concept of dual corruption (masking and additive noise) is a relatively simple yet effective technique for improving the robustness and generalization of autoencoders for imputation. The balanced loss function adds another layer of control and adaptability.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The architecture and training process are clearly explained with the help of a figure.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The paper presents comprehensive experimental results on five real-world tabular datasets with varying missing rates. The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the contribution of each component of the proposed method. The comparative analysis with multiple baselines (GANs, DAEs, VAEs) strengthens the claims of state-of-the-art performance.
*   **Reproducibility Efforts:** The authors address the challenge of reproducibility in deep learning imputation by standardizing the experimental procedure across all algorithms and adjusting baseline architectures for a fair comparison.
*   **Analysis:** The ablation studies are well-designed and insightful. They help to understand the impact of the dual corruption and balanced loss mechanisms. The discussion of overcomplete representations is a valuable consideration for future improvements.
*   **Simple and Effective:** The authors repeatedly highlight the simple nature of their method as an advantage. In the context of complex models which often add attention and complex latent spaces, a simple approach that works well is welcomed.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Missingness Mechanisms:** While the paper evaluates performance under MCAR and MNAR mechanisms, a more comprehensive analysis including MAR data would further strengthen the claims of robustness and generalizability. Discussing the theoretical limitations of DC-DAE under different missingness assumptions could also be valuable.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The optimal value of the denoising loss weight (α) varies considerably across datasets. A more in-depth investigation of the factors influencing this parameter and potential automated tuning strategies would enhance the practicality of the method.
*   **Limited Discussion of Computational Cost:** While the paper emphasizes the lightweight architecture of DC-DAE, a quantitative comparison of the computational cost (training time, memory usage) with the baselines would be beneficial, especially for large datasets.
*   **Lack of Connection to "inverse dynamics models":** The current method focuses solely on static data imputation. The paper does not consider temporal dependencies or the potential application of the proposed technique in domains that would benefit from learned "inverse dynamics models" applied to time series imputation or control problems.
*   **Limited Feature Interactions:** The architecture is a very simple fully connected network. This restricts the degree to which the model can capture higher-order feature interactions. Adding some attention mechanisms or perhaps more complex architectures may help.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand the Evaluation:** Include a more comprehensive evaluation of different missingness mechanisms (including MAR) and potentially more diverse datasets (e.g., time series data). Consider a theoretical discussion of the limitations under different missingness mechanisms.
*   **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning:** Explore automated hyperparameter tuning strategies for the denoising loss weight (α) to improve the ease of use and robustness of the method.
*   **Computational Cost Analysis:** Provide a quantitative comparison of the computational cost of DC-DAE with the baselines, especially for large datasets.
*   **Discuss Limitations:** Add more discussion of the limitations of the current approach and the potential directions for future work. For example, is it possible to extend this approach to other modalities.
*   **Explore Time Series Extensions:** While out of the scope of the current work, briefly mentioning how DC-DAE could be adapted for time series imputation by incorporating recurrent layers or temporal convolutions would be valuable.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach for missing data imputation. The dual corruption and balanced loss mechanisms provide a significant improvement over existing methods, as demonstrated by the comprehensive experimental results. While there are some areas for improvement, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field and is worthy of acceptance.
