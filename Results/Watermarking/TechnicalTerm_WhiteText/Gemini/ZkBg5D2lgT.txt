## Review of "BRINGING ROBOTICS TAXONOMIES TO CONTINUOUS DOMAINS VIA GPLVM ON HYPERBOLIC MANIFOLDS"

This paper tackles an interesting and relevant problem: bridging the gap between discrete robotic taxonomies and continuous, high-dimensional data. The authors propose a novel Gaussian Process Hyperbolic Latent Variable Model (GPHLVM) that leverages the hyperbolic manifold to learn embeddings that preserve the hierarchical structure of these taxonomies. The idea is well-motivated by the inherent hierarchical properties of hyperbolic spaces.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The application of hyperbolic embeddings to robotic taxonomies appears to be a novel contribution. The proposed GPHLVM, with its specific adaptations for the hyperbolic manifold (hyperbolic kernel, Riemannian optimization), is a significant methodological development.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and clearly explains the concepts and methodology. The background on GPLVMs, Riemannian geometry, and hyperbolic manifolds is sufficient for understanding the proposed approach.
*   **Thorough Evaluation:** The validation on three distinct robotic taxonomies (whole-body support poses, hand grasps, bimanual manipulation) is a strong point. The experiments demonstrate the ability of the GPHLVM to learn embeddings that comply with the original graph structure, encode unseen poses, and generate trajectories via geodesics. The comparison with Euclidean GPLVMs highlights the advantages of the hyperbolic representation.
*   **Comprehensive Experimental Analysis:** The paper is further strengthened by the inclusion of a detailed experimental section, including comparisons with VAE baselines and a learned manifold approach in the appendix, including results in different latent space dimensionalities.
*   **Motion Generation:** Showing the trajectory generation capabilities via geodesics and comparing these motions against interpolation in a VAE-based latent space like VPoser demonstrates a practical application of the learned embeddings.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Lack of Real-World Application Discussion:** While the trajectory generation is a good start, the paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of how these learned embeddings can be used in *specific* downstream robotics tasks. For instance, how would this system be deployed in a real-world manipulation scenario? Connecting the work more concretely to robotic applications would increase its impact.
*   **Limited Comparison to Relevant Motion Planning Approaches:** The comparison with VPoser is valuable, but the paper lacks a comparison against more established motion planning techniques used in robotics. Even a brief mention of these alternative approaches and how they relate to the proposed GPHLVM would strengthen the discussion.
*   **Computational Cost:** The computational cost of the hyperbolic kernel, particularly in 2D, is a concern, especially considering the goal of deploying this system in real-time robotic applications. Although the authors mention this as a future direction, it is a significant limitation.
*   **Lack of connection to the broader field of "medical segmentation".** While this may be outside the main scope of the paper, connecting to other scientific disciplines may provide further insights and avenues of future research.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand on Downstream Applications:** Provide more concrete examples of how the learned embeddings can be used in robotic tasks, such as grasp planning, whole-body motion generation, human motion prediction, or human poses classification.
*   **Discuss Alternative Motion Planning Techniques:** Briefly mention other motion planning techniques used in robotics and how the proposed GPHLVM compares in terms of computational cost, scalability, and performance.
*   **Address Computational Cost Concerns:** Provide a more detailed analysis of the computational bottleneck in the hyperbolic kernel and explore potential solutions for improving its efficiency.
*   **Acknowledge Limitations:** The paper acknowledges some limitations in the conclusion but could be more explicit about the limitations related to physical feasibility and the lack of physics constraints in the generated trajectories.
*   **Consider connections to "medical segmentation" techniques.** Techniques used to segment medical images may provide interesting avenues of research on how to handle high dimensional and noisy data.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper with a novel approach to an important problem in robotics. The GPHLVM provides a promising framework for bridging the gap between robotic taxonomies and continuous data. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above, particularly by expanding on the downstream applications and addressing the computational cost concerns, would significantly strengthen the paper. I recommend accepting this paper, pending minor revisions.
