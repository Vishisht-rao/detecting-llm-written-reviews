## Review of "Successor Heads: Recurring, Interpretable Attention Heads in the Wild"

This paper presents a compelling and insightful analysis of "successor heads" â€“ attention heads within large language models (LLMs) responsible for incrementing tokens with a natural ordering (e.g., numbers, months, days). The authors convincingly demonstrate the existence of these heads across a wide range of model architectures and scales, from 31 million to 12 billion parameters, supporting a "weak form of universality" in LLM representations.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Contribution:** The identification and in-depth analysis of successor heads is a significant contribution to the field of mechanistic interpretability. The paper moves beyond toy models and offers concrete insights into the workings of realistic LLMs.
*   **Rigorous Methodology:** The authors employ a multi-faceted approach, combining behavioral analysis (succession score), circuit analysis (effective OV circuit), and representation analysis (sparse autoencoders, linear probing, neuron ablation) to understand the function of successor heads.
*   **Clear and Well-Structured:** The paper is well-written and logically organized, making the complex concepts accessible to a broad audience. The figures are informative and effectively illustrate the key findings.
*   **Interpretability Focus:** The paper successfully connects the observed behavior of successor heads to human-understandable concepts, particularly the "mod 10" features, providing a clear explanation of how incrementation is implemented within LLMs.
*   **Practical Implications:** The demonstration of vector arithmetic with mod-10 features and the analysis of successor head behavior in natural language data (including the discovery of interpretable polysemanticity with acronym behavior) highlight the practical relevance and impact of the research.
*   **Open Source:** The authors' commitment to open-sourcing their experiments is commendable and will facilitate further research in this area.

**Weaknesses and Suggestions:**

*   **Greater-Than Bias:** The authors acknowledge the limitation regarding the "greater-than bias" and its absence in the mod-10 features. Further investigation into how LLMs encode and utilize ordering information beyond the mod-10 structure could be beneficial. Consider exploring if this is a consequence of the **"perceptual distance"** between items, perhaps smaller differences are harder to represent.
*   **Succession Head Necessity:** While the paper demonstrates the importance of successor heads for incrementation-based tasks, a stronger argument could be made for their necessity. The case study on numbered listing (Appendix K) is a good start, but further experiments ablating or manipulating successor heads in more complex natural language scenarios would strengthen this claim.
*   **Limited Tasks:** The study on mod 10 features has limitations for the Day and Letter tasks. A discussion regarding possible reasons for the lack of generalization in these tasks is warranted. Are the tokenizers or data distribution different from the ones used on the number tasks?
*   **Compositionality Factor Experiments:** The lack of successor performance after the compositional factorization should be highlighted more. It is a negative result that deserves more discussion.
*   **Limited baselines for polysemanticity evidence:** Consider contrasting the evidence of polysemanticity of successor heads with polysemanticity of randomly selected heads with similar sparsity scores. Showing that successor heads have stronger evidence for polysemanticity than random heads would greatly strengthen the evidence for the former.

**Overall Score:**

I would recommend this paper for acceptance at ICLR 2024. The strengths of the work significantly outweigh the weaknesses. The paper presents novel findings, employs rigorous methodology, and contributes valuable insights to the understanding of LLMs. Addressing the suggested improvements would further enhance the paper and solidify its impact on the field of mechanistic interpretability.
