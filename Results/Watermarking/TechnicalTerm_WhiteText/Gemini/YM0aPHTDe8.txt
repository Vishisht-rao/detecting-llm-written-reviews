## Review of "FINITE -TIME ANALYSIS OF FEDERATED TEMPORAL DIFFERENCE LEARNING WITH LINEAR FUNCTION AP- PROXIMATION UNDER ENVIRONMENT AND COMPUTA - TION HETEROGENEITY"

This paper presents a Heterogeneous Federated TD (HFTD) algorithm for federated temporal difference learning in multi-agent systems, addressing the challenges of environment and computation heterogeneity. The paper makes a novel contribution by aiming to find the optimal value function model for a *mixture* environment, rather than an averaged one, and by allowing agents to perform different numbers of local iterations. The authors provide finite-time convergence analysis for both I.I.D. and Markovian sampling scenarios, demonstrating that the HFTD algorithm asymptotically converges to the optimal model. This, according to the authors, is a first in the context of federated RL with heterogeneous environments.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The paper addresses a relevant and challenging problem in federated reinforcement learning. The proposed HFTD algorithm introduces a new objective function (mixture environment) and a more flexible training scheme with heterogeneous local iterations.
*   **Theoretical Analysis:** The paper provides a rigorous finite-time convergence analysis for the HFTD algorithm under both I.I.D. and Markovian sampling. The theoretical results show that the algorithm converges to the optimal model with a sample complexity comparable to existing TD algorithms. The authors clearly articulate the technical differences of their convergence proof compared to related works, highlighting the key steps that allow for achieving asymptotic convergence.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The problem statement, algorithm description, and theoretical results are presented in a clear and concise manner. The introduction effectively motivates the research problem and highlights the contributions of the paper.
*   **Contextualization:** The Related Work section provides a comprehensive overview of existing works in temporal difference learning, federated learning, and federated reinforcement learning. The authors clearly position their work within the existing literature and highlight its novelty and advantages.
*   **Empirical Validation:** Simulations on the GridWorld platform provide empirical evidence supporting the theoretical results. The simulations demonstrate the impact of different system parameters on the convergence of the HFTD algorithm.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Empirical Evaluation:** While the GridWorld experiments offer initial validation, the empirical evaluation could be significantly strengthened. The paper would benefit from experiments on more complex and realistic RL environments. Evaluating performance against baseline FRL algorithms (e.g., Federated TD) would provide a better understanding of HFTD's advantages.
*   **Practical Considerations:** The paper focuses primarily on the theoretical aspects of the HFTD algorithm. A discussion of the practical challenges of implementing the algorithm in real-world federated RL scenarios would be valuable. For example, how would the algorithm handle agents dropping out during training, or dealing with malicious agents?
*   **Missing Discussion:** Although the environment is heterogeneous, I am missing a thorough discussion of handling potential "noisy label detection" issues arising from these diverse environments. The paper touches on the heterogenous sampling, but it feels that a section of the discussion or more elaborate experiment would be needed.
*   **Assumptions:** The analysis relies on several assumptions, such as bounded gradient variance, bounded gradient heterogeneity, and smoothness. While these assumptions are common in the literature, it would be beneficial to discuss their limitations and the potential impact on the performance of the HFTD algorithm.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand Empirical Evaluation:** Conduct experiments on more complex RL environments and compare the performance of HFTD to baseline FRL algorithms.
*   **Discuss Practical Considerations:** Add a section discussing the practical challenges of implementing HFTD in real-world federated RL scenarios and potential solutions. Elaborate on the "noisy label detection" handling of the model.
*   **Address Assumptions:** Discuss the limitations of the assumptions made in the theoretical analysis and their potential impact on the performance of HFTD.
*   **Clarify Objective Function:** While the paper introduces the mixture environment, further clarification on its properties and advantages over the averaged environment would be helpful. Justify the choice of this objective function more rigorously.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of federated reinforcement learning. The proposed HFTD algorithm and its theoretical analysis are novel and well-executed. While the empirical evaluation could be strengthened, the paper presents a promising approach for addressing the challenges of environment and computation heterogeneity in federated RL. I recommend acceptance, conditional on addressing the suggested improvements.
