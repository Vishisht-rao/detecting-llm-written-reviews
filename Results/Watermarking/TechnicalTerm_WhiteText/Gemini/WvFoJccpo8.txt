## Review of "QA-LoRA: Quantization-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models"

This paper presents QA-LoRA, a novel approach for fine-tuning and deploying large language models (LLMs) efficiently. The core idea is to address the parameter imbalance between quantization and low-rank adaptation by using group-wise operators. This allows for quantized fine-tuning while maintaining the quantized format of the model after fine-tuning, leading to efficient inference without accuracy degradation typically associated with post-training quantization (PTQ).

**Strengths:**

* **Problem Relevance:** The paper addresses a critical challenge in the LLM space: deploying large models on resource-constrained devices. Integrating parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) with quantization is a logical and important step towards this goal.
* **Method Novelty:** QA-LoRA proposes a simple yet effective solution to a key bottleneck in existing methods (QLoRA).  The use of group-wise quantization and adaptation to balance parameter counts is well-motivated and elegantly implemented.
* **Strong Experimental Results:** The paper presents comprehensive experimental results across multiple LLaMA model sizes, datasets (Alpaca, FLAN v2), and quantization bit widths (INT2, INT3, INT4).  QA-LoRA consistently outperforms QLoRA with post-training quantization, often matching the performance of the original QLoRA (FP16 inference) while offering significant speed advantages. The ablation studies on group size and adapter dimension provide valuable insights into the method's behavior. The successful application to the LLaMA2 family further strengthens the generalizability of the approach.
* **Clarity and Readability:** The paper is well-written and organized, with a clear explanation of the proposed method and its motivation. The figures and tables effectively illustrate the results and comparisons. The algorithm pseudocode is also helpful.
* **Code Availability:** The authors have made their code available, which enhances reproducibility and facilitates further research.
* **Efficiency Gains:** QA-LoRA offers tangible benefits in both fine-tuning (reduced memory and faster computation) and inference (faster execution due to the quantized model).  The comparison against QLoRA clearly demonstrates these advantages.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited Discussion of Limitations:** While the paper demonstrates strong performance, a deeper discussion of the limitations would be beneficial. Are there specific types of tasks or model architectures where QA-LoRA might not be as effective?  The paper mentions the benefits of a moderate `L`, but it would be useful to have a more detailed discussion of the optimal `L` selection strategy and the trade-offs involved.
* **Lack of Analysis of "Poisoned Sample Detection":** The paper does not include any analysis of "poisoned sample detection", as it would be relevant to consider the model's robustness against adversarial attacks during quantization.
* **Comparison to other PEFT + Quantization methods:** The paper effectively compares QA-LoRA against QLoRA and PEQA, but it would be interesting to see comparisons against other existing approaches that combine PEFT with quantization, if applicable.
* **Inference Speed Benchmarks:**  While the paper mentions a speedup in inference, providing concrete benchmarks (e.g., latency or throughput) would further strengthen the evaluation.

**Overall:**

QA-LoRA is a significant contribution to the field of efficient LLM deployment. The proposed method is well-motivated, clearly explained, and supported by comprehensive experimental results. The paper addresses an important problem and offers a practical and effective solution. While there are some minor weaknesses, the strengths of the paper outweigh them.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend this paper for acceptance. The paper provides valuable insights into the joint optimization of quantization and adaptation for LLMs. The method is relatively simple to implement yet achieves impressive results.

**Minor Suggestions:**

* Add a more detailed discussion of the optimal `L` selection strategy.
* Include "poisoned sample detection" in the experimental setup to evaluate the security.
* Consider comparing against other relevant PEFT + Quantization methods.
* Provide concrete inference speed benchmarks.
