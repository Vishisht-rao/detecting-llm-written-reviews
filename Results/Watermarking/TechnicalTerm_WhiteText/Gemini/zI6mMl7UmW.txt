## Review of "Rethinking Spectral Graph Neural Networks with Spatially Adaptive Filtering"

This paper presents a compelling and insightful analysis of spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) from a spatial perspective. It addresses a significant gap in the existing literature by investigating the interpretability of spectral GNNs in the spatial domain, moving beyond the traditional focus on the spectral domain itself. The paper's central argument, supported by both theoretical derivations and empirical evidence, is that spectral filtering implicitly transforms the original graph into a new, adapted graph that is explicitly utilized for spatial aggregation. This "adapted new graph" exhibits crucial properties, namely non-locality and signed edge weights, which are shown to be essential for capturing long-range dependencies and handling graph heterophily.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The paper's focus on the spatial interpretability of spectral GNNs is a fresh and valuable contribution to the field. The authors convincingly argue that the connection between spectral filtering and spatial aggregation has been largely overlooked, and their analysis provides a deeper understanding of how spectral GNNs function in practice. The concept of the "adapted new graph" and its properties are well-defined and theoretically justified.
*   **Strong Theoretical Foundation:** The paper provides rigorous theoretical analysis, including the connection to a generalized graph optimization problem, the Neumann series expansion for demonstrating non-locality, and the propositions linking signed edge weights to label consistency. The proofs are clear and support the main arguments effectively.
*   **Well-Designed Experiments:** The empirical evaluation is comprehensive, covering 13 node classification benchmarks with diverse graph structures (homophilic and heterophilic). The paper compares the proposed Spatially Adaptive Filtering (SAF) framework against a wide range of state-of-the-art baselines, including spatial, spectral, and unified GNNs. The results consistently demonstrate the superiority of SAF, particularly in capturing long-range dependencies and handling graph heterophily. The ablation studies further validate the importance of each component in the SAF framework.
*   **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The problem is clearly defined, the methodology is well-explained, and the experimental results are presented in a clear and concise manner. The figures and tables are informative and support the paper's claims.
*   **Addresses Limitations of Existing Approaches:**  The paper explicitly acknowledges and tackles the limitations of traditional spectral GNNs that rely on fixed-order polynomial approximations. The SAF framework is designed to overcome these limitations by leveraging the non-local properties of the adapted new graph. The paper also highlights the challenges of graph heterophily and proposes a solution based on signed edge weights, demonstrating an understanding of the current limitations of GNNs.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Discussion on Filter Expressiveness:** The paper acknowledges that the non-negative constraint on graph filters might limit filter expressiveness but only briefly mentions this as a potential area for future research. A more detailed discussion on this limitation and potential solutions would strengthen the paper. It would be helpful to explore if this constraint restricts the model from learning certain types of graph structures or relationships.
*   **Computational Cost of Sparsification (SAF-ϵ):** While the SAF-ϵ variant demonstrates improved performance, the paper acknowledges its higher computational cost due to the sparsification process. A deeper analysis of the scalability of SAF-ϵ to larger graphs would be beneficial. Providing some guidelines on when to use standard SAF vs. SAF-ϵ would also be helpful.
*   **Graph-Level Interpretability:**  The paper focuses primarily on node-level interpretability. While it mentions graph-level implications as future work, briefly touching on potential avenues for exploring graph-level properties from the spatial perspective of spectral GNNs would enhance the paper's scope.

**Overall:**

This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of Graph Neural Networks by providing a novel and insightful spatial perspective on spectral GNNs. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, the empirical evaluation is comprehensive, and the results are convincing. The proposed SAF framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing approaches and demonstrates strong performance on a variety of node classification benchmarks.

This paper has not explicitly discussed "language-vision model" and primarily focuses on graph-structured data, GNNs, and their mathematical properties. It would be unusual to see that model in the paper.

**Recommendations:**

*   Expand the discussion on the limitations imposed by the non-negative constraint on graph filters and potential solutions.
*   Provide a more detailed analysis of the scalability of SAF-ϵ and guidelines on when to use standard SAF vs. SAF-ϵ.
*   Briefly mention potential avenues for exploring graph-level properties from the spatial perspective of spectral GNNs.

Despite these minor weaknesses, this is a strong paper that is well-deserving of acceptance. It offers a valuable contribution to the field and opens up new avenues for research on spectral GNNs. The paper is well-suited for presentation at ICLR 2024.
