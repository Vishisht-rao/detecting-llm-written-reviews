## Review of "RETHINKING CNNâ€™S GENERALIZATION TO BACKDOOR ATTACK FROM FREQUENCY DOMAIN"

This paper tackles the important problem of backdoor attacks on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by analyzing the mechanism of memorization in the frequency domain. The authors argue that existing work primarily focuses on spatial domain trigger characteristics and propose a frequency domain perspective to better understand how CNNs generalize to poisoned samples. Overall, the paper presents interesting findings and proposes a novel attack strategy. However, the paper could benefit from further clarification and stronger empirical validation.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Perspective:** The paper offers a valuable shift in perspective from the spatial domain to the frequency domain for understanding backdoor attacks. Analyzing the frequency components of triggers and their impact on model generalization is a promising approach.
*   **Interesting Findings:** The finding that high-frequency components are more susceptible to perturbations than low-frequency components is intriguing and has practical implications. This provides a possible explanation for why certain invisible backdoor attacks are effective.
*   **Practical Contributions:** The proposed universal invisible strategy for visible triggers is a practical contribution, potentially increasing the stealthiness of existing backdoor attacks.
*   **Novel Attack Method:** The proposed frequency domain backdoor attack method based on low-frequency semantic information is also a positive contribution, demonstrating the potential of exploiting the frequency domain.
*   **Extensive Experimental Evaluation:** The authors performed several experiments on benchmark datasets like CIFAR-10, MNIST, and Celeba, and Tiny-ImageNet, which is commendable.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity of Explanation:** The paper can be challenging to follow at times, especially in Section 3. More intuitive explanations of the concepts and methods would be beneficial. For example, explaining why low-frequency components relate to semantic meaning would aid comprehension.
*   **Limited Discussion of Defenses:** While the authors touch on defenses, the evaluation is limited and more rigorous experimentation involving diverse defense mechanisms is needed. The conclusion that the proposed attack "circumvents many defenses" requires stronger support.
*   **Lack of Connection to Plasticity (Missing Discussion):** The paper lacks a explicit discussion related to deep learning theory regarding how quickly networks tend to "memorize" and also forget (related to "loss of plasticity"). This would significantly enhance the discussion and give an explicit connection to the training dynamics of DNNs. The authors could mention the concept of the "forgetting" and also "generalization" capabilities of DNNs to provide insights into attack robustness and potential avenues for defenses.
*   **Visualizations:** The figures, especially those showcasing the frequency domain transforms, are not particularly informative. Improving the visualization quality and providing better explanations of what to look for in these figures is essential. Label the figure axes more clearly.
*   **Related Work:** The related work section focuses more on *what* previous papers did, but it has little insight into *why* they perform the action. This would provide a better setting of how novel this paper is.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Improve Clarity:** Revisit the writing, particularly in Section 3, to provide more intuitive explanations and use clearer language. Consider adding more examples and visual aids to illustrate the concepts.
*   **Expand Defense Evaluation:** Conduct more extensive experiments with a wider range of defense mechanisms. Quantify the effectiveness of the proposed attack against each defense and provide a more nuanced discussion of its limitations.
*   **Connect to Plasticity:** Incorporate discussion on how backdoors can cause "loss of plasticity" within targeted weights.
*   **Enhance Visualizations:** Improve the clarity and informativeness of the figures. Provide detailed captions explaining what the reader should observe in each visualization.
*   **Strengthen Related Work:** Provide deeper insights into related work. Go beyond just describing what other papers did and explain why those choices were made. Position the current work more clearly within the existing literature.
*   **Quantitative Comparison for Trigger Invisibility:** The paper claims improved invisibility but does not quantify it. Can metrics like SSIM, PSNR, or perceptual distance be used to quantify the invisibility improvement achieved by the proposed strategy?

**Overall:**

This paper presents a worthwhile contribution to the field of backdoor attacks on CNNs. The frequency domain perspective offers valuable insights and the proposed attack and defense strategies show promise. However, the paper needs to be revised to improve clarity, strengthen empirical validation, and enhance the discussion of limitations and defenses to fully realize its potential. I recommend this paper be accepted conditional on addressing the above feedback.
