## Review of "ENHANCING HUMAN EXPERIENCE IN HUMAN -AGENT COLLABORATION : A H UMAN -CENTERED MODELING APPROACH BASED ON POSITIVE HUMAN GAIN"

This paper addresses an important and often overlooked aspect of game AI: enhancing the human player's experience in human-agent collaboration, rather than solely focusing on agent performance. The paper proposes a "human-centered" modeling scheme, where the human experience is defined as the extent to which humans achieve their desired in-game goals. To achieve this, the authors introduce the Reinforcement Learning from Human Gain (RLHG) approach, which aims to train agents to enhance human goal achievement while maintaining agent autonomy. The approach involves estimating a "baseline" human performance and incentivizing agents to learn behaviors that demonstrably improve upon this baseline.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Importance:** The problem tackled by the paper is highly relevant. Moving beyond "self-centered" agents is crucial for creating engaging and enjoyable collaborative AI systems. The concept of "human gain" and explicitly separating human contribution from agent assistance is a valuable contribution.
*   **Technical Approach:** The RLHG approach is well-motivated and clearly explained. The two-stage training process, the use of a gain network, and the integration of a human policy embedding are all technically sound choices. The paper also addresses the critical challenge of human-agent credit assignment. The authors cleverly sidestep the need for manual reward shaping by introducing the baseline value.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The experiments are comprehensive. The use of both human model-agent tests and real-world human-agent tests provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed RLHG approach. The objective performance and subjective preference results in Honor of Kings are compelling. It's particularly interesting to see the general-level player performance improve to the level of high-level players with the RLHG agent.
*   **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The figures and tables effectively illustrate the concepts and results. The inclusion of a case study further strengthens the understanding of how the RLHG agent operates.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **"Markov Policy" Discussion Missing:**  The paper doesn't explicitly relate its approach to the underlying decision-making process. A discussion of whether the learned policies are "markov policy"  is missing and would benefit the reader's understanding of the long-term effects of the learned behaviors.
*   **Human Model Limitations:** The reliance on a fixed human model (JueWu-SL agent) for training is a potential limitation.  The learned behaviors might be over-specialized to this specific human model, potentially limiting generalization to other human players with different playstyles. While real-world human-agent tests address this to some extent, more discussion of the potential impact and possible solutions (e.g., training with a diverse set of human models) would be beneficial.
*   **Win Rate Trade-off:** The inevitable decrease in Win Rate when prioritizing human goals is acknowledged but could be discussed in more depth.  The adaptive adjustment mechanism helps, but a deeper analysis of the optimal balance between agent performance and human experience, perhaps exploring different weighting schemes or adaptive Î±, would be valuable.
*   **Action Space Limitations:** The description of the action space is somewhat generic. More details on how the action space is represented, specifically relating to move operations and skill target selections, would be useful.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Markov Property Discussion:** Discuss the properties of the learned "markov policy"  and how they affect the long-term behavior of the AI.
*   **Human Model Generalization:**  Discuss the limitations of using a fixed human model for training and potential solutions to improve generalization to diverse human players.
*   **Win Rate vs. Human Experience:**  Provide a more in-depth analysis of the trade-off between Win Rate and human experience. Explore alternative weighting schemes or adaptive adjustment mechanisms.
*   **Action Space Details:** Add more details about the specific action space representation used in Honor of Kings, including the ranges of values for things like Move X/Y and how target units are selected.
*   **Ethical Considerations:** While the paper mentions ethical considerations and IRB approval, expanding on the potential broader impacts, especially regarding the types of human goals the system should *not* be optimized for, would strengthen the paper.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of human-agent collaboration in games. The RLHG approach is well-designed, and the experimental results provide compelling evidence for its effectiveness. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact. I recommend this paper for acceptance at ICLR.
