## Review of "FRAUG: FREQUENCY DOMAIN AUGMENTATION FOR TIMESERIES FORECASTING"

This paper introduces FrAug, a novel frequency domain data augmentation technique for time series forecasting (TSF). The authors argue that existing time-domain augmentation methods are unsuitable for TSF because they disrupt the fine-grained temporal relationships crucial for accurate forecasting. FrAug, consisting of frequency masking and frequency mixing, aims to preserve the semantic consistency of augmented data-label pairs by operating in the frequency domain. The paper presents extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrating that FrAug improves forecasting accuracy, particularly in scenarios with limited data, such as cold-start forecasting and forecasting under distribution shifts.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The paper addresses a significant gap in the literature by systematically investigating data augmentation techniques specifically tailored for the TSF task. The idea of leveraging the frequency domain to preserve temporal relationships is a novel and promising approach.
*   **Clarity:** The problem statement is well-defined, and the motivation behind FrAug is clearly articulated. The explanation of frequency masking and frequency mixing is easy to understand. The connection to periodic events driving forecastable behavior is intuitive.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The paper provides comprehensive experimental results across multiple datasets and state-of-the-art TSF models. The results consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of FrAug in improving forecasting accuracy compared to existing augmentation techniques. The focus on long-term forecasting, cold-start forecasting, and test-time training adds practical value to the findings.
*   **Impact:** The reported results, particularly in cold-start forecasting where FrAug enables models trained with only 1% of the original data to achieve comparable performance, are compelling and highlight the potential for real-world impact. The performance gains on the ILI dataset under distribution shifts are also impressive.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors provide a link to their code repository, enhancing the reproducibility of their work.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Lack of Deeper Analysis of Parameter Sensitivity:** While the authors mention using cross-validation to select the mask/mix rate, a more in-depth analysis of how these parameters affect the performance of FrAug would be valuable. Understanding the optimal range and sensitivity of these parameters could guide practitioners in applying FrAug effectively.
*   **Limited Comparison with Other Frequency-Based Methods:** While the paper compares FrAug with Robusttad, a more thorough comparison with other frequency-based techniques (if any exist in the TSF domain) would strengthen the paper's contributions. The introduction mentions "time-frequency feature augmentation" in general, but only Robusttad is actually used in comparisons.
*   **"Parallel Generation" Not Addressed:** The paper doesn't directly address methods for "parallel generation" of time series forecasts. If the authors could demonstrate how FrAug could be used to improve these models, the impact would be more significant. It would be helpful to address this limitation even in future work.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Parameter Analysis:** Include a section dedicated to analyzing the impact of the mask/mix rate on the performance of FrAug. Consider visualizing the performance across different parameter values to illustrate the sensitivity.
*   **Further Literature Review:** Expand the related work section to include a more comprehensive discussion of frequency-based techniques for time series analysis, even if they are not directly related to forecasting. A more nuanced comparison could strengthen the novelty claim.
*   **Future Work:** Suggest future research directions, such as exploring adaptive strategies for determining the mask/mix rate based on the characteristics of the time series data, incorporating FrAug into other TSF model architectures, or explicitly enabling "parallel generation".
*   **Clarify "Semantic Consistency":** While the concept of "semantic consistency" is central, a more formal definition or explanation could be beneficial. Consider elaborating on how FrAug specifically preserves this consistency in the context of TSF.

**Overall:**

This is a well-written and well-supported paper that presents a novel and effective data augmentation technique for time series forecasting. The experimental results are convincing, and the potential impact of FrAug in data-scarce scenarios is significant. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper and enhance its contribution to the field.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend this paper for acceptance, pending minor revisions to address the weaknesses and suggestions outlined above.
