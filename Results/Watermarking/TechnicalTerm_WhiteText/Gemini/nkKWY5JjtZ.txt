## Review of "EXACT MEAN SQUARE LINEAR STABILITY ANALYSIS FOR SGD"

This paper tackles a very important and timely problem: understanding the stability of SGD and its dependence on batch size, providing a closed-form expression for the mean-square stability threshold. This is a significant contribution as, while the stability threshold of GD is well-known, an explicit expression for SGD has been elusive. The paper is well-motivated by connecting stability to generalization and other desirable properties of trained models. The derived theoretical results are then experimentally validated on the MNIST dataset.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The primary strength is the derivation of a closed-form expression for the mean-square stability threshold of SGD. This fills a gap in the literature and provides a more precise understanding of SGD's behavior compared to existing implicit conditions or those relying on strong assumptions.
*   **Clear Theoretical Results:** The paper presents key theorems (1, 3, 4, 5) and propositions (1, 2, 3) that provide clear and actionable insights. Notably, the results on the monotonic relationship between batch size and stability threshold (Proposition 1) and the interpretation of SGD as a process alternating between full-batch and single-sample gradients (Proposition 2) are valuable contributions.
*   **Connection to Practice:** The paper links its theoretical findings to practical observations, such as the behavior of learning rate scheduling and the effect of batch size on sharpness and generalization.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The experiments on MNIST provide evidence supporting the theoretical claims, particularly regarding the prediction of stability thresholds and the convergence of SGD's behavior to GD's with moderate batch sizes. The visualizations in Figure 2 are particularly helpful in illustrating the relationship between sharpness and the generalized sharpness bound.
*   **Well-Organized and Clearly Written (Mostly):** The paper is generally well-organized, with a clear introduction, background, and presentation of results. The appendices provide detailed proofs and further explanations, which is essential for a theoretical work of this nature. The notations are carefully introduced and summarized.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Computational Complexity:** While the paper provides an *explicit* condition, the computational cost of evaluating the threshold (requiring matrix inversions and spectral norm computations on d^2 x d^2 matrices) may limit its practical applicability in high-dimensional settings. While necessary conditions are provided, further simplification or approximation techniques could enhance the real-world value of the analysis.
*   **Limited Experimental Scope:** The experiments are confined to a relatively simple setting (single hidden-layer ReLU networks on MNIST with a quadratic loss). While this allows for controlled validation of the theoretical results, it raises questions about the generalizability of the findings to more complex architectures, datasets, and loss functions commonly used in deep learning. It would be beneficial to at least discuss the challenges of extending the experiments to such settings.
*   **Clarity of Certain Proofs:** While the paper contains many mathematical derivations, some steps could be more explicitly explained to improve readability. Particularly, the connection from spectral properties of Q to PSD properties is not clear.
*   **Missing Related Work:** While related works are mentioned, it is important to check for any missing work that closely relates to the paper.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address Computational Complexity:** Discuss potential approximations or simplifications to the stability threshold condition that could make it more tractable for large-scale problems. Explore the use of the lower-bounds described to approximate the sharpness and stability threshold.
*   **Expand Experimental Validation:** While computationally expensive, even a limited extension of the experiments to a slightly more complex dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10) or a deeper network architecture would strengthen the paper. Alternatively, a more thorough discussion of the limitations of the current experimental setup and directions for future experimental work would be helpful.
*   **Improve Clarity of Proofs:** Provide more detailed explanations of key steps in the proofs, particularly regarding the connection between the eigenspaces of the transition matrix and the PSD constraints. Consider adding illustrative examples or diagrams to aid understanding.
*   **Clarify Assumptions:** Explicitly state all assumptions used in the analysis, including those related to the smoothness of the loss function, the independence of batches, and the nature of the minima being considered.
*   **Relevance of "Rigl":** There is no mention of the term "rigl" in the paper. This suggests a misunderstanding of the content, or that there may be missing material that would help readers understand the relation between the paper and "rigl."

**Overall Recommendation:**

This is a strong paper with a significant theoretical contribution to the understanding of SGD's stability. While there are some weaknesses, the strengths outweigh them. I recommend acceptance, conditional on addressing the suggestions for improvement, particularly regarding the computational complexity and the limited experimental scope.
