## Review of "FEDHYPER: A Universal and Robust Learning Rate Scheduler for Federated Learning with Hypergradient Descent"

This paper proposes FEDHYPER, a novel learning rate scheduling algorithm for Federated Learning (FL) based on hypergradient descent. The paper addresses the critical challenge of hyperparameter optimization, specifically focusing on the adaptation of learning rates, in the context of FL. The core idea is to leverage hypergradients to schedule both global and local learning rates, aiming for robustness against varying initial learning rate configurations and improved convergence.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Relevance:** The paper tackles a significant challenge in FL - the difficulty of learning rate tuning due to data heterogeneity and communication constraints. Automating and robustifying this process is valuable.
*   **Novelty:** FEDHYPER's approach of using hypergradients to dynamically adjust both global and local learning rates is a novel contribution to the field of FL. The decomposition into global (FEDHYPER-G), server-side local (FEDHYPER-SL), and client-side local (FEDHYPER-CL) schedulers provides flexibility and modularity.
*   **Theoretical Foundation:** The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the hypergradients and offers a convergence guarantee for FEDHYPER under standard assumptions. This adds credibility to the proposed method.
*   **Comprehensive Experiments:** The paper presents extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets (FMNIST, CIFAR10, Shakespeare) demonstrating the effectiveness of FEDHYPER in terms of convergence speed, final accuracy, and robustness to initial learning rate settings. The ablations are well-designed and insightful.
*   **Empirical Results:**  The results convincingly show that FEDHYPER consistently outperforms FEDAVG and other baselines, achieving faster convergence and improved accuracy, especially when initial learning rates are suboptimal.  The paper clearly shows that FEDHYPER accelerates "convergence 1.1-3 Ã— faster than F EDAVG" on popular visual and textual datasets.
*   **Practical Applicability:** The paper highlights the ease of integration of FEDHYPER with existing FL optimization algorithms (server momentum, FEDADAM), making it a practical enhancement for existing FL systems.  The combination experiments indicate the value of FEDHYPER as a "universally applicable enhancement plugin".
*   **Reproducibility:**  The authors have released the source code, promoting reproducibility and further research.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Complexity:** While the modular design is a strength, the algorithm description can be somewhat complex. A clearer and more concise explanation of the interactions between the different schedulers would be beneficial.
*   **Lack of Discussion on Communication Costs:** While the paper mentions communication costs as a challenge in FL, it does not explicitly analyze or quantify the communication overhead introduced by FEDHYPER, particularly FEDHYPER-SL.  This is important to consider, as the benefits of faster convergence could be offset by increased communication.
*   **Limited Consideration of "Attention Steering":** The paper focuses primarily on learning rate scheduling. While "attention steering" is an area of burgeoning importance, particularly in the context of generative modelling, the authors do not investigate its incorporation into FEDHYPER. An exploration of attention steering in federated learning could highlight future avenues for potential research.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Simplify the Algorithm Description:** Consider using more visual aids (e.g., diagrams) to illustrate the flow of information and the interactions between the different schedulers.
*   **Analyze Communication Costs:** Include an analysis of the communication overhead of FEDHYPER, comparing it to other FL algorithms.
*   **Discuss "Attention Steering":** In the related work section, consider adding a paragraph on "attention steering" as an important avenue for future investigation. This adds value to the paper's contribution by suggesting future research directions.
*   **Address Limitations:**  Acknowledge the computational overhead of FEDHYPER-CL and provide more concrete guidance on when to choose each scheduler in practice based on resource constraints and task characteristics.
*   **Formatting Issues:** There are some formatting inconsistencies in the paper (e.g., spacing around operators) that should be addressed.

**Overall:**

This is a well-written and technically sound paper that presents a significant contribution to the field of Federated Learning. The proposed FEDHYPER algorithm offers a promising approach to learning rate scheduling, addressing a critical challenge in FL and demonstrating strong empirical performance.  Despite the minor weaknesses, the paper is well-deserving of acceptance.
