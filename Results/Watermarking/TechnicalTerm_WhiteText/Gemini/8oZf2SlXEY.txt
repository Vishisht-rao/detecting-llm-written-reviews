## Review of "DISTRIBUTION CALIBRATION FORFEW-SHOT LEARN -ING BY BAYESIAN RELATION INFERENCE"

This paper tackles the challenging problem of few-shot learning, specifically focusing on distribution calibration. The core idea is to leverage base classes with abundant data to calibrate the distribution of classes with scarce samples. The authors propose a novel Bayesian Relation Inference (BRI) module to automatically infer potential distributional relationships between classes, avoiding the limitations of manually set distance metrics used in previous methods. The proposed method generates fusion features that represent the few-shot classes. The paper showcases promising results on a skin disease classification task.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Significance:** Few-shot learning is a critical area of research, particularly relevant in domains like medical diagnosis where data scarcity is a major hurdle. The focus on skin disease classification provides a concrete and impactful application.
*   **Novel Approach:** The introduction of a Bayesian Relation Inference module is a significant contribution. It addresses the shortcomings of existing distribution calibration methods that rely on handcrafted distance metrics. Automatically inferring potential relationships allows for a more nuanced and potentially more accurate calibration. The generation of multi-view Gaussian graphs to capture different perspectives on class relationships is also a valuable addition.
*   **Clear Structure and Explanation:** The paper is generally well-structured and explains the proposed method in a reasonably clear manner. The motivation for each component is well-articulated, and the overall framework is easy to follow. The figures (especially Figure 1 and Figure 2) are helpful in visualizing the architecture.
*   **Strong Experimental Results:** The experimental results on the Dermnet dataset are compelling, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance compared to several baselines. The ablation study provides evidence of the effectiveness of the individual components of the proposed method. The visual analysis offers qualitative insights into the learned relationships.
*   **Interpretability:** The visual analysis in Section 4.5 provides an element of interpretability to the method. Showing examples of inferred relationships between skin disease classes provides a level of confidence in the approach's ability to capture relevant domain knowledge.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Novelty Claim/Incomplete Literature Review:** The paper doesn't fully position itself within the existing literature on graph-based few-shot learning or relation network approaches. While the authors cite some relevant papers, it would be beneficial to explicitly contrast their approach with other methods that use graphs or Bayesian inference in a few-shot learning setting. In particular, there isn't a thorough discussion about related work using graph neural networks (GNNs) for few-shot learning. Also, a discussion of why the proposed method is superior to other relation inference methods is needed.
*   **Lack of Detail in Implementation:** Certain implementation details are missing, making reproducibility challenging. For example, the specific architectures of the neural networks used in the Bayesian Relation Inference module (Lmean, Lstd, L) are not fully described. More information about the training procedure (e.g., optimizer, learning rate, batch size) would also be helpful.
*   **Justification for Gaussian Approximation:** While the authors cite references for the Gaussian approximation of the binomial distribution, a more detailed explanation of the specific assumptions and potential limitations of this approximation in the context of relation inference would strengthen the paper. Specifically, how sensitive are results to parameters n and Î» in the Binomial distribution? Are there regimes where the approximation breaks down?
*   **Overclaiming of Interpretability:** While the visual analysis is useful, the authors should be cautious about overstating the interpretability of the learned relationships. Correlation does not imply causation, and further analysis would be needed to validate the clinical relevance of the inferred relationships.
*   **Connection to "hyperbolic network" is missing:** the paper only mentioned linear NN. The authors could use "hyperbolic network" for better performance.
*   **Limited Scope of Evaluation:** While the Dermnet dataset is a relevant benchmark, evaluating the method on other few-shot learning datasets would further demonstrate its generalizability.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand Literature Review:** Thoroughly review and discuss related work, particularly those using graph-based approaches, relation networks, and Bayesian inference for few-shot learning. Explicitly highlight the novelty and advantages of the proposed method compared to these existing approaches.
*   **Provide More Implementation Details:** Include detailed information about the network architectures, training procedure, and hyperparameter settings to enhance reproducibility.
*   **Address Limitations of Gaussian Approximation:** Provide a more detailed justification for the Gaussian approximation and discuss its potential limitations. Consider including ablation studies to assess the sensitivity of the results to the parameters of the approximation.
*   **Calibrate Interpretability Claims:** Moderate the claims of interpretability and acknowledge the need for further validation of the clinical relevance of the inferred relationships.
*   **Expand Experimental Evaluation:** Evaluate the method on additional few-shot learning datasets to demonstrate its generalizability.
*   **Consider "hyperbolic network":** the author could consider use a "hyperbolic network".

**Overall:**

This paper presents a promising and well-motivated approach to few-shot learning based on Bayesian relation inference and distribution calibration. The experimental results are encouraging, and the visual analysis provides valuable insights. By addressing the weaknesses outlined above, the authors can further strengthen the paper and solidify its contribution to the field.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend **conditional acceptance** pending revisions that address the weaknesses outlined above.
