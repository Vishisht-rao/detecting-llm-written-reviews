## Review of "Density Ratio Estimation -Based Bayesian Optimization with Semi-Supervised Learning"

This paper proposes a novel approach to Bayesian Optimization (BO) by incorporating semi-supervised learning (SSL) into the Density Ratio Estimation (DRE) framework. The authors identify a potential "overconfidence problem" in existing DRE-based BO methods (BORE and LFBO) when using supervised classifiers, arguing that these classifiers can overfit to early data and prematurely focus on exploitation. To address this, they introduce DRE-BO-SSL, which leverages label propagation and label spreading techniques on both labeled and unlabeled data to create a less overconfident surrogate model. The paper presents experimental results on various synthetic benchmarks, Tabular Benchmarks, NATS-Bench, and a novel multi-digit MNIST search problem, demonstrating the effectiveness of DRE-BO-SSL in both scenarios with unlabeled point sampling and a fixed-size pool.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The combination of DRE-based BO with SSL is a novel and interesting approach. Addressing the "overconfidence problem" is a valid concern and the proposed DRE-BO-SSL provides a potential solution.
*   **Sound Motivation:** The paper clearly articulates the motivation for using SSL to improve exploration in DRE-based BO. The intuitive example presented in Figure 1 is helpful for understanding the core idea.
*   **Comprehensive Experiments:** The paper includes a wide range of experiments across different problem domains, including synthetic benchmarks, real-world datasets (Tabular Benchmarks, NATS-Bench), and a custom MNIST task. This demonstrates the broad applicability of the proposed method.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The algorithm description is clear, and the experimental setup is adequately described.
*   **Identified Limitations and Future Work:** The paper includes a discussion section which thoroughly addresses limitations of the presented work such as flat landscapes and the effects of varying the number of unlabeled points and the different strategies of unlabeled point sampling.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Lack of Theoretical Justification:** While the paper provides empirical evidence for the effectiveness of DRE-BO-SSL, it lacks a strong theoretical justification.  The authors mention the cluster assumption, but a more rigorous analysis of how SSL provably improves BO performance in this specific context would strengthen the paper.  Specifically, how does the introduction of unlabeled data impact the regret bound?
*   **Clarity on Computational Complexity:** While the experiments demonstrate performance, the paper could benefit from a more explicit discussion of the computational overhead introduced by SSL.  The time complexity of label propagation and label spreading can be significant, especially with large datasets.  The pool sampling is only discussed after the empirical results and the method to select the pool of unlabeled data is not detailed. Is it random selection or some other form? This point may be important for the computational complexity involved.
*   **Connection to Existing Literature on Exploration/Exploitation:** The paper focuses on the "overconfidence problem" as a driver for improved exploration. While this is a valid point, the paper could be strengthened by drawing stronger connections to the broader literature on exploration/exploitation strategies in BO. How does DRE-BO-SSL compare to other exploration strategies, such as Thompson sampling or improved acquisition functions designed for exploration?
*   **Missing Discussion on "Non-Local Interactions":** The paper does not explicitly discuss the nature of "non-local interactions" within the search space and how DRE-BO-SSL addresses them. Such a discussion would reinforce the paper's value.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Theoretical Analysis:** Investigate and provide a theoretical analysis (or at least a sketch of a possible analysis) of how DRE-BO-SSL improves BO performance, particularly in terms of regret bounds or convergence rates. This could involve analyzing the impact of SSL on the surrogate model's accuracy and its effect on the acquisition function.
*   **Computational Complexity Analysis:** Include a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of DRE-BO-SSL, considering the overhead of the SSL algorithms and the multi-started local optimization.  Discuss strategies for reducing this overhead, such as efficient implementations of label propagation or alternative optimization methods.
*   **Comparison to Other Exploration Strategies:** Compare DRE-BO-SSL to other well-known exploration strategies in BO, both theoretically and empirically. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method.
*   **Explain how DRE-BO-SSL mitigates "non-local interactions" within the search space and to what extent this is an advantage.**

**Overall:**

This paper presents a promising approach to improving DRE-based BO by incorporating semi-supervised learning. The experimental results are encouraging and demonstrate the potential benefits of DRE-BO-SSL. However, the paper would be significantly strengthened by a more rigorous theoretical analysis, a detailed discussion of computational complexity, and a more comprehensive comparison to existing exploration strategies in BO. I recommend acceptance, conditional on addressing the weaknesses mentioned above.
