## Review of "STYLIST: S TYLE -DRIVEN FEATURE RANKING FOR ROBUST NOVELTY DETECTION"

This paper addresses the important problem of robust novelty detection, specifically aiming to identify semantic novelties while being robust to stylistic distributional shifts. The paper introduces Stylist, a novel feature ranking method that leverages a multi-environment setup to identify and subsequently drop environment-biased features from pre-trained representations. The experimental results demonstrate that Stylist improves the performance of various novelty detection algorithms across several datasets, particularly in scenarios with high spurious correlations.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Formulation:** The paper clearly defines the problem of robust novelty detection and effectively frames it within the context of content vs. style shifts, borrowing from the domain generalization literature. The use of a multi-environment setup to disentangle content and style is a solid foundation.
*   **Method Novelty:** The Stylist method itself is simple, yet effective. The idea of ranking features based on their distribution distances across environments (using Wasserstein distance) is intuitively appealing and well-motivated.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper presents a thorough experimental evaluation across three datasets: fMoW, DomainNet, and the newly introduced COCOShift. The inclusion of COCOShift, a synthetic dataset with controlled levels of spuriousness, is a significant contribution, allowing for detailed analysis. The comparison against several feature selection algorithms and novelty detection methods further strengthens the evaluation.
*   **Ablation Studies:** The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the design choices of Stylist. The analysis of different distance metrics and feature ranking combinations, as well as the impact of dataset spuriousness, helps to understand the method's behavior. The comparison with PCA highlights the advantages of feature selection over dimensionality reduction in this context.
*   **Interpretability Insights:** The experiments in Section 4.2 offer an interesting glimpse into the interpretability of the selected features. The ability of top-ranked environment-biased features to predict the style of an image lends credibility to the method.
*   **Well-written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it relatively easy to follow the proposed approach and the experimental results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Methodological Assumptions:** The paper relies on two key assumptions: (1) the pre-trained feature extractor can represent both seen and novel content categories, and (2) the change in style dominates over the change in content when comparing different environments. While these assumptions are reasonable given the current landscape of pre-trained models, they should be explicitly discussed as potential limitations.  The discussion in Section 3 could be expanded to further justify the choices made, or to discuss situations where these assumptions might break down.
*   **Parameter Sensitivity (Percent of Features):** While the paper mentions using a validation set to select the optimal percentage of features, the sensitivity of the results to this parameter could be discussed in more detail. Are there rules of thumb or heuristics that can be used to guide this selection process?
*   **Justification of chosen Novelty Detection Algorithms:** The paper tests Stylist on several novelty detection algorithms. While this shows generalizability, it lacks a deep dive into *why* some algorithms benefit more than others. It would be beneficial to offer a hypothesis for *why* kNN norm sees such a significant boost on fMoW.
*   **Clarity on Hyperparameter Selection:** The appendices mention hyperparameter selection details, but it would be helpful to summarize them in the main body. For example, briefly mentioning the approach for optimal feature selection and the k value for kNN in the main paper would make it more self-contained.
*   **Missing Baseline:** While the comparison to PCA is good, it lacks a comparison to a more simple feature selection method such as selecting features at random or selecting the first *n* features. This is a low-effort baseline that could show how important feature selection is to the presented approach.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand discussion on assumptions:** Elaborate on the implications of the assumptions made in Section 3. Under what conditions might these assumptions fail, and how could Stylist be adapted to address such cases?
*   **Discuss Parameter Sensitivity:** Discuss the sensitivity of the method to the percentage of features selected. Provide guidance on how to choose this parameter effectively. Investigate rules of thumb.
*   **Analyze Algorithm-Specific Improvements:** Delve into *why* Stylist leads to different levels of performance improvement for different novelty detection algorithms. Offer explanations or hypotheses for why some algorithms benefit more than others.
*   **Include Missing Baselines:** Add a simple feature selection baseline in the experiments.
*   **Streamline Hyperparameter Discussion:** Summarize key hyperparameter selection details in the main body of the paper.
*   **Terminology:** Consider revising the language around "environment-biased" features. While descriptive, it could be refined to be more precise and impactful.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that addresses a relevant problem and proposes a novel and effective solution. The comprehensive evaluation and ablation studies demonstrate the value of Stylist for robust novelty detection. The suggested improvements would further strengthen the paper and make it more accessible to the broader research community. The paper never uses the term "set operation".

I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
