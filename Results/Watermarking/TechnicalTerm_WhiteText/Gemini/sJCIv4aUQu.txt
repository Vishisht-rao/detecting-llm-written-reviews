## Review of "ADOPT: Modified Adam Can Converge with the Optimal Rate with Any Hyperparameters"

This paper presents a novel adaptive gradient method called ADOPT, designed to address the well-known convergence issues of popular algorithms like Adam and RMSprop in non-convex optimization. The key contribution is a modification to the Adam update rule that provably achieves the optimal convergence rate of O(1/âˆšT) without requiring strong assumptions like bounded stochastic gradients and without problem-dependent hyperparameter tuning.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses an Important Problem:** The non-convergence of Adam-like methods under general conditions is a significant issue in deep learning. This paper tackles this problem head-on.
*   **Clear Motivation and Explanation:** The paper provides a clear explanation of the cause of non-convergence in Adam and RMSprop, highlighting the correlation between the second moment estimate and the current gradient. The proposed modifications are well-motivated and easy to understand.
*   **Solid Theoretical Foundation:** The paper presents a theoretical convergence analysis of ADOPT, proving its optimal convergence rate under standard assumptions. The key insight is to decorrelate the gradient and second moment estimate, and the impact of the proposed change of order between the momentum calculation and scaling operations is explained.
*   **Comprehensive Experimental Validation:** The paper includes a range of experiments, from a simple toy problem to complex tasks like ImageNet classification, generative modeling (NVAE), language model finetuning (LLaMA), and reinforcement learning (PPO). The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ADOPT in practice, often outperforming or matching existing adaptive gradient methods.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it relatively easy to follow the arguments and understand the proposed algorithm. The detailed proofs are delegated to the appendix, keeping the main text focused on the key ideas.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Assumption 4 (Bounded Second Moment):** While the paper addresses the issue of bounded stochastic gradients (Assumption 5), it still relies on the assumption of a bounded second moment (Assumption 4). As the authors acknowledge, this assumption could be further relaxed to a bounded variance, which is a more common assumption in the analysis of SGD. This limits the applicability of the algorithm and the theoretical results in certain scenarios.
*   **Novelty of "Decorrelation" idea:** The paper credits Zhou et al. (2019) for originally diagnosing the root cause of Adam's divergence as a result of correlated gradients and 2nd order moment estimates. While the application of this principle may be novel, it isn't clearly differentiated from AdaShift.
*   **Lack of deeper analysis on cases where ADOPT underperforms Adam:** Although the experiments show that ADOPT achieves competitive or superior results compared to Adam in most cases, the paper does not deeply analyze situations where ADOPT might underperform Adam. Understanding the limitations of ADOPT in specific scenarios would provide a more complete picture.

**Minor Comments:**

*   The algorithm name, ADOPT, is a bit generic. A more descriptive name might be more impactful.
*   In the related works section, a discussion of algorithms based on "kernel smoothing" could be relevant, especially if the proposed method shares any similarities or differences in its gradient averaging approach.
*   The experimental setup for some tasks could be described in more detail, including specific hyperparameter settings for each algorithm.

**Overall:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of stochastic optimization by proposing a novel adaptive gradient method that addresses the convergence issues of Adam without requiring strong assumptions or problem-dependent hyperparameter tuning. The theoretical analysis is solid, and the experimental results are compelling. While the reliance on Assumption 4 is a limitation, the paper represents a significant step forward in developing more robust and reliable adaptive gradient methods for deep learning. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the points mentioned above.
