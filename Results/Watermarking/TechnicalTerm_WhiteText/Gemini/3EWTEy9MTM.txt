## Review of "Chain of Thought Empowers Transformers to Solve Inherently Serial Problems"

**Overall Impression:**

This paper presents a compelling theoretical and empirical investigation into the power of Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting in improving the reasoning capabilities of transformers, particularly on tasks requiring serial computation. The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and offers significant contributions to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying CoT. The connection to circuit complexity provides a valuable lens for analyzing expressiveness, and the empirical results strongly support the theoretical claims. The authors provide both upper and lower bounds, showcasing a deep understanding of the limitations of standard transformers and how CoT overcomes them.

**Strengths:**

*   **Strong Theoretical Foundation:** The paper grounds its investigation in the well-established framework of circuit complexity. By relating transformer expressiveness to complexity classes like AC0, TC0, and P/poly, the authors provide a rigorous and insightful analysis.
*   **Clear Distinction Between Parallel and Serial Computation:** The paper effectively highlights the limitations of standard transformers, which are inherently parallel computers, in solving problems that require sequential reasoning. The theoretical result showing that CoT allows transformers to simulate circuits of size T with T steps is particularly impactful.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The empirical results convincingly corroborate the theoretical findings. The chosen tasks (modular addition, permutation composition, iterated squaring, and circuit value problem) effectively demonstrate the superiority of CoT, especially for inherently serial problems and low-depth transformers. The inclusion of a "hint" setting provides a valuable control to isolate the effects of CoT from simply providing more information.
*   **Novelty:** The work provides tighter expressiveness upper bounds by considering constant-bit precision transformers, a more realistic setting than the infinite-precision assumptions often made in prior works. The focus on constant-precision transformers is relevant given the prevalence of BF16 in models like Llama2.
*   **Connections to Existing Literature:** The paper does a good job of situating its findings within the existing literature on transformer expressiveness, contrasting its approach with previous works that focus on log-precision and uniform transformers.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Non-Uniformity:** While the authors acknowledge the non-uniform nature of their complexity class CoT, a more in-depth discussion of the implications of this choice would be beneficial. Specifically, elaborating on the practical considerations of having different transformers for different input lengths, and contrasting it with the uniform setting, would further contextualize the theoretical results. While discussed in Appendix H, perhaps a condensed version of this discussion should be in the main body.
*   **Fixed-Point vs. Floating-Point:** While the upper bounds are shown for constant precision transformers, the lower bounds are proved for fixed point numbers. A brief discussion on whether the lower bounds could be extended to include floating point numbers would strengthen the presentation.
*   **Lack of discussion of "equilibrium learning":** The paper does not mention the concept of "equilibrium learning" within the context of chain of thought reasoning. Discussing the interplay, if any, between chain of thought and "equilibrium learning" could be an interesting addition.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Elaborate on the implications of the non-uniformity of the CoT complexity class in the main text.**
*   **Briefly discuss the potential for extending the lower bound results to floating-point numbers.**
*   **Consider adding a paragraph discussing the role of "equilibrium learning" in the context of chain of thought prompting.**

**Conclusion:**

This is a strong and insightful paper that makes a significant contribution to our understanding of Chain of Thought prompting. The theoretical analysis, empirical validation, and clear presentation make this a valuable addition to the ICLR community. I recommend acceptance.
