## Review: Embedding File Structure for Tabular File Preparation

This paper introduces a novel approach, RENEMB, for learning structural embeddings of tabular data files, focusing on characters *not* belonging to data values. The core idea – that explicitly representing file structure (S), as opposed to just the payload (T), can significantly benefit data preparation – is compelling. The paper clearly defines the "file structure" concept and frames common data preparation tasks as structure wrangling problems. The proposed solution, a self-supervised neural network architecture leveraging transformers and convolutional layers, is well-motivated and addresses a real gap in current approaches that primarily focus on semantic understanding of pre-parsed data.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The concept of learning embeddings specifically for *file structure* is a fresh perspective in the data preparation landscape. The architecture, combining pattern tokenization with transformer and convolutional modules, appears genuinely innovative.
*   **Problem Definition:** The paper clearly articulates the problem of file preparation, highlighting the limitations of existing tools and the challenges of applying general-purpose ML models. The breakdown into subproblems (dialect detection, row classification, column type detection) provides a clear framework for evaluation.
*   **Self-Supervised Approach:** The use of self-supervised learning, particularly the proposed "structural masking" and "same file prediction" tasks, is a significant strength. Training on a large corpus (GitTables) without extensive manual labeling is a practical advantage.
*   **Experimental Results:** The paper presents a thorough experimental evaluation across multiple tasks and datasets. The comparison against strong baselines, including CleverCSV and large language models (LLMs), provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of RENEMB. The analysis of error cases is also insightful.
*   **Hybrid Approach:** The idea of combining RENEMB with STRUDEL (the state-of-the-art row classification) in a hybrid model is a clever way to leverage the strengths of both structural and semantic approaches, showing a clear improvement over both.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors' commitment to sharing datasets, trained models, and source code is commendable and crucial for the reproducibility and further development of this work.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Architecture Details:** While the paper outlines the architecture, certain details could be elaborated further. For example, a more detailed explanation of the convolutional feature extractor, including the specific layers and their configuration, would be beneficial. Also a more detailed description of the training loss used for the entire model would be helpful.
*   **Discussion of LLM Prompts:** While the appendix provides details on the prompts used for LLMs, a more in-depth discussion of prompt engineering challenges and limitations would be valuable. The failures of LLMs highlight the need for specialized structural understanding.
*   **Limited Error Analysis:** The error analysis, while present, could be more in-depth. Specifically, for row classification, understanding *why* certain row types (e.g., data vs. derived) are frequently misclassified would be valuable for future improvements. It also would be useful to determine how the model performs with files written in different languages.
*   **Novelty Claim:** The paper at no point mentions the "nesting architecture" described in the review's instructions, but this is not a major problem.
*   **Typos:** The paper contains a few typos, for example in section 2.2 the word ENEMB is sometimes prepended with "R".

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Elaborate on the Convolutional Feature Extractor:** Provide more detail on the architecture and training of this module.
*   **Deepen Error Analysis:** Investigate the reasons for specific misclassifications, particularly in row classification.
*   **Consider Alternative Tokenization Schemes:** Explore different pattern tokenization strategies and their impact on performance.
*   **Address Limitations:** Explicitly discuss the limitations of the approach, such as its performance on highly unstructured data or its reliance on newline characters for row splitting.
*   **Explore Applications Beyond the Studied Tasks:** Mention potential applications of structural embeddings in other data preparation scenarios (e.g., data integration, schema matching).

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and well-executed approach to a challenging problem. The idea of learning structural embeddings for tabular files is innovative, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RENEMB architecture. While some details could be elaborated further and the error analysis deepened, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of data preparation. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the points raised above.
