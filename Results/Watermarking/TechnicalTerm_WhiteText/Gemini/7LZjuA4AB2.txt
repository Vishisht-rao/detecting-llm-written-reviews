## Review of "ASKYOUR DISTRIBUTION SHIFT IF PRE-TRAINING IS RIGHT FOR YOU"

This paper investigates the effectiveness of pre-training for improving robustness to distribution shifts, focusing on distinguishing between shifts that arise from poor extrapolation and those caused by biases in the training data. The core claim is that pre-training primarily helps mitigate poor extrapolation but is less effective in addressing dataset biases. This is supported by theoretical motivation in a logistic regression setting and empirical evidence on synthetic and natural distribution shifts. The paper further explores implications of this finding, suggesting the complementary benefits of combining pre-training with bias-mitigation techniques and the potential for effective fine-tuning on small, de-biased datasets.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Problem Statement and Focused Scope:** The paper clearly defines the problem of inconsistent pre-training effectiveness under different distribution shifts and focuses specifically on differentiating the roles of extrapolation and bias. This focused approach allows for a more in-depth analysis.
*   **Strong Theoretical Grounding:** The logistic regression setting provides a valuable theoretical foundation for the paper's central claim, making the subsequent empirical results more convincing. Theorem 3.1 provides a compelling explanation for why pre-training can affect generalization outside the training manifold but not within.
*   **Well-Designed Experiments:** The experiments are carefully designed to isolate the effects of extrapolation and bias. The use of synthetic shifts with controlled properties (tint, label, pad, flip) and the division of natural shifts into "in-support" and "out-of-support" splits are particularly effective. The CIFAR-5m experiment further strengthens the argument regarding the role of sample size.
*   **Practical Implications and Actionable Insights:** The paper moves beyond simply identifying the limitations of pre-training to suggest practical strategies for developing more robust models. The exploration of combining pre-training with bias-mitigation techniques (DFR, data curation) provides concrete guidance for practitioners. The finding that small, de-biased datasets can be surprisingly effective when combined with pre-training is especially valuable.
*   **Clarity and Writing Quality:** The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The explanations are clear, and the figures are helpful in illustrating the key concepts and results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Novelty in Characterizing Distribution Shifts:** While the distinction between extrapolation and bias is useful, it builds on existing characterizations of distribution shifts (e.g., covariate shift, domain generalization, subpopulation shift). The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of how its framework relates to and extends these existing characterizations. Appendix D.3 helps but could be strengthened.
*   **Limited Investigation of Alternative Fine-Tuning Strategies:** The paper primarily focuses on full fine-tuning. While it acknowledges the existence of other fine-tuning strategies (e.g., linear probing, zero-shot transfer), the analysis of these alternatives is limited. Exploring whether these strategies interact differently with extrapolation and bias could enrich the paper. While mentioned that zero-shot and LP-FT are sometimes more robust, it doesn't go far enough. Are they *always* more robust to one type of shift?
*   **The "In-Support" Effective Robustness of Pre-Training:** The paper acknowledges the somewhat surprising result that pre-trained models exhibit *some* effective robustness even in the "in-support" shifts, attributing it to the limited sample size. While this explanation is plausible, it could be further investigated and validated. For example, exploring the impact of different sample sizes on the magnitude of this effect could provide stronger evidence. Also, are there other potential explanations? Did pre-training prevent some *shortcut*?
*   **Oversimplification of Real-World Shifts:** The paper's framework assumes a clear separation between extrapolation and bias. However, real-world distribution shifts are often more complex and may involve a combination of both factors. The paper could benefit from a more nuanced discussion of how its framework applies to such complex shifts.
*   **Margin Gain Measurement Nuance**: While a good choice, some readers would want to know how performance is affected on subpopulations where it is already excellent. Some may prefer to see a Brier score or some other metric that explicitly down-weights improvements where you're already perfect.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand the Discussion of Related Work:** Provide a more comprehensive overview of existing characterizations of distribution shifts and explicitly position the paper's framework within this landscape.
*   **Investigate Alternative Fine-Tuning Strategies More Thoroughly:** Explore how different fine-tuning strategies (e.g., linear probing, zero-shot transfer, robust fine-tuning methods) interact with extrapolation and bias.
*   **Provide More Rigorous Validation of the "In-Support" Robustness Explanation:** Conduct more experiments to validate the limited sample size explanation for the effective robustness of pre-trained models in "in-support" shifts. Are there other explanations?
*   **Address the Complexity of Real-World Shifts:** Discuss how the paper's framework can be applied to more complex real-world shifts that involve a combination of extrapolation and bias. Perhaps include a case study of a very complex shift.
*   **Consider Brier Score**.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of pre-training and distribution shift robustness. The paper is theoretically grounded, empirically supported, and offers practical implications for developing more robust models. While there are some areas for improvement, the paper is well-written, clearly presented, and worthy of acceptance.

I did not see any discussion on "continuous scene reconstruction." in this paper.
