## Review of "Synergistic Patch Pruning for Vision Transformer: Unifying Intra- & Inter-Layer Patch Importance"

**Summary:**

This paper proposes a novel approach, SynergisTic pAtch pRuning (STAR), for compressing Vision Transformers (ViTs) by pruning redundant image patches. STAR distinguishes itself by combining dynamic, intra-layer patch importance scores (derived from attention maps) with offline-calculated, inter-layer importance scores (obtained via modified Layer-wise Relevance Propagation - LRP). These scores are then fused using a KL-divergence-based minimization to determine overall patch importance. The paper further proposes an automated method for selecting per-layer pruning rates based on average cosine similarity (ACS) of patches, leading to a single hyperparameter for controlling the FLOPs reduction. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate significant acceleration of inference with minimal performance degradation compared to existing methods.

**Strengths:**

* **Novelty:** The core idea of unifying intra- and inter-layer patch importance is novel and well-motivated. The paper effectively argues for the limitations of relying solely on intra-layer attention when making pruning decisions, highlighting the importance of considering patch relevance across different ViT blocks.
* **Technical Soundness:** The proposed method is technically sound. The use of attention maps for intra-layer importance and LRP for inter-layer importance are appropriate choices. The KL-divergence-based fusion is mathematically justified and leads to a closed-form solution. The ACS-based automated pruning rate selection provides a practical and efficient way to balance compression and accuracy.
* **Empirical Validation:** The paper presents extensive experimental results on ImageNet using various ViT models (DeiT and LV-ViT). The results demonstrate that STAR consistently achieves higher compression rates and/or better accuracy compared to state-of-the-art ViT pruning methods. The throughput measurements clearly showcase the acceleration achieved by the proposed method.
* **Ablation Study:** The ablation study provides valuable insights into the contribution of different components of STAR. It demonstrates the effectiveness of both intra- and inter-layer importance scores, the automatic pruning schedule, and the KL fusion mechanism.
* **Adaptive Variant (a-STAR):** The adaptive retention rate selection (a-STAR) further enhances the method by allowing input-dependent pruning rates, leading to even higher compression without significant accuracy loss.
* **Clarity:** The paper is well-written and clearly explains the proposed method and experimental setup. The figures and tables are informative and contribute to a better understanding of the paper.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Justification of LRP Modifications:** While the paper mentions modifications to LRP (aggregating relevance at the patch level and capturing correlation between one patch and multiple classes), the rationale for these modifications and their impact on the final performance could be further elaborated.  A more detailed explanation in Appendix B is helpful, but further justification for the *specific* adaptations would strengthen the paper.
* **Limited Analysis of Failure Cases:** The paper focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of STAR on average. A discussion of potential failure cases, i.e., scenarios where STAR might not perform well, would provide a more complete picture of the method's limitations.  Are there specific image types or datasets where this pruning strategy is less effective?
* **Fine-tuning Consistency:** It is not entirely clear whether *all* competing methods were fine-tuned using the same protocol (120 epochs with hard distillation). Ensuring consistent fine-tuning across all methods is crucial for a fair comparison.

**Questions for the Authors:**

* Could you provide a more detailed justification for the specific modifications made to the LRP method?
* Are there any image types or datasets where you anticipate STAR performing less optimally compared to other pruning methods?
* Can you confirm that all competing methods were fine-tuned using the same 120-epoch hard distillation protocol?
* The paper could benefit from discussing the relationship between the learned features and the subsequent pruning decisions.  Does the pruning process influence the quality of the "task-conditioned representations" that the network learns?

**Overall Recommendation:**

This paper presents a strong contribution to the field of ViT compression. The proposed STAR method is novel, technically sound, and empirically validated. The paper is well-written and provides valuable insights into the importance of considering both intra- and inter-layer patch relevance for effective pruning. Despite the minor weaknesses mentioned above, I recommend acceptance as a conference paper.
