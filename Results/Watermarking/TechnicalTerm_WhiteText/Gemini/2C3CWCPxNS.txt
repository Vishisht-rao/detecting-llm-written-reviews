## Review of "Preconditioning for Physics-Informed Neural Networks"

This paper tackles a significant problem in the field of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs): the occurrence of training pathologies that hinder convergence and accuracy. The central idea of using the condition number as a diagnostic metric for these pathologies is novel and well-motivated, drawing a clear connection to classical numerical analysis. The paper proposes a preconditioning algorithm to improve the condition number and demonstrates its effectiveness across a range of PDE problems.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The application of condition number analysis to understand and address PINN training issues is a significant contribution. The paper provides a fresh perspective on why PINNs sometimes fail and offers a practical solution based on established numerical techniques.
*   **Theoretical Foundation:** The paper presents a theoretical framework that connects the condition number to error control and convergence rate. The theorems, while relying on assumptions (acknowledged by the authors), provide a solid justification for the proposed preconditioning approach. The example using the Poisson equation helps ground the theoretical concepts.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The experimental results are comprehensive and convincing. The evaluation on the PINNacle benchmark demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method across a variety of PDE problems. The significant error reductions, particularly in problems previously deemed unsolvable, are impressive. The "set generation" process is well described and implemented, leading to robust performance improvements.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The introduction clearly outlines the problem and contribution. The explanations of the preconditioning algorithm and its application to PINNs are understandable.
*   **Comprehensive Experiments**: The overview and ablations were quite helpful to understanding the full utility of the approach

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Assumptions:** The theoretical results rely on assumptions that might not always hold in practice. For example, the Lipschitz continuity of F<sup>-1</sup> is crucial for Theorem 3.2, but its validity for complex PDEs needs further justification. Additionally, Assumption A.4 that the neural network has sufficient approximation capability also leaves some room for improvement. The paper could benefit from a discussion of the limitations imposed by these assumptions and potential strategies for mitigating them.
*   **Limited Scope of Preconditioning:** The preconditioning algorithm is primarily focused on linear PDEs discretized using finite difference methods. While the authors mention extensions to time-dependent and nonlinear problems, the details provided in Appendix B.3 are rather brief. More elaboration on how the preconditioning strategy can be adapted to these more general cases would be beneficial.
*   **Mesh Dependency:** The mesh-based nature of the preconditioning algorithm inherently limits its applicability to high-dimensional PDEs, as acknowledged by the authors. The paper could benefit from a discussion of alternative preconditioning techniques that are less dependent on mesh discretization.
*   **Numerical Implementation**: the paper needs more detail around the specific implementation of FDM used in the benchmarked results

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Discussion of Assumptions:** Provide a more detailed discussion of the assumptions underlying the theoretical results and their potential limitations. Explore strategies for relaxing or mitigating these assumptions.
*   **Elaboration on Extensions:** Expand the discussion of how the preconditioning algorithm can be adapted to time-dependent and nonlinear PDEs. Provide more specific examples and implementation details.
*   **Alternative Preconditioning Techniques:** Briefly discuss alternative preconditioning techniques that are less dependent on mesh discretization and could be applied to high-dimensional PDEs.
*   **Ablation Study Details**: Expand the ablation study to cover more hyperparameters

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach for addressing training pathologies in PINNs. The use of condition number analysis is a valuable contribution to the field, and the proposed preconditioning algorithm shows significant promise. While there are some areas for improvement, the paper is well-written, theoretically sound, and empirically validated. I recommend acceptance, pending minor revisions addressing the points raised above.
