## Review of "ON THE IDENTIFIABILITY OF SWITCHING DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS"

This paper tackles the challenging and important problem of identifiability in Switching Dynamical Systems (SDSs). The authors present a theoretical analysis, extending existing identifiability results from non-temporal latent variable models to the sequential setting. The work focuses on identifying conditions under which SDSs, with Markov Switching Model (MSM) priors, are identifiable up to affine transformations. The paper provides both theoretical contributions and empirical validation.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The paper makes a significant contribution by extending identifiability analysis to sequential latent variable models, specifically SDSs. This is a relatively unexplored area compared to identifiability in static latent variable models.
*   **Theoretical Rigor:** The authors provide a detailed and mathematically sound analysis of identifiability conditions for MSMs and SDSs. The use of analytic function properties and finite mixture modeling techniques is well-motivated and executed. The detailed proofs (in the appendix) add confidence to the theoretical claims.
*   **Practical Relevance:** The paper connects the theoretical results to practical applications by developing estimation algorithms for identifiable SDSs. The empirical studies on time-series segmentation and regime-dependent causal discovery demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework. The application to climate data and video segmentation provides compelling evidence.
*   **Clear Exposition:** The paper is generally well-written and structured. The introduction clearly outlines the problem, the contributions, and the related work. The sections on theoretical considerations are logically organized and build upon existing knowledge.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The synthetic experiments with ground truth provide valuable insights into the behavior of the estimation algorithms. The real-world applications on climate data and salsa dancing sequences further demonstrate the practicality and applicability of the proposed approach.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Estimation Challenges:** While the paper focuses on identifiability, the estimation aspect appears to be challenging in practice. The authors acknowledge the sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning and the potential for state collapse. A more in-depth discussion of these practical challenges and potential mitigation strategies would be beneficial.
*   **Consistency Guarantees:** The authors mention that the variational learning method used for SDS estimation lacks consistency guarantees. While this is a known limitation of variational inference, further discussion on the implications for causal discovery and representation learning would be valuable. Are there specific scenarios where the lack of consistency is particularly problematic?
*   **Limited Baselines in Experiments:** While KVAE is a relevant baseline, a comparison to other contemporary sequential latent variable models with a focus on time-series segmentation might provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
*   **Discussion of Limitations:** Although the paper touches on limitations in the conclusion, a more explicit and detailed discussion of the limitations of the theoretical results and the empirical findings would be appreciated. For instance, the restriction to first-order Markov models and the lack of consideration for non-stationary discrete latent state priors could be highlighted more prominently.
*   **Missing Connection to Reinforcement Learning:** While the paper doesn't explicitly discuss it, the identifiable representations learned by SDSs *could* be relevant for reinforcement learning in partially observable environments. The paper *could* have made a connection with "saferl," especially in scenarios where understanding and interpreting the latent state dynamics is crucial for safe and reliable control.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   Expand the discussion on estimation challenges and potential solutions. Explore techniques for mitigating state collapse and improving the robustness of the estimation algorithms.
*   Provide a more detailed analysis of the implications of the lack of consistency guarantees for causal discovery and representation learning.
*   Consider including additional baselines in the empirical studies, particularly for the time-series segmentation task.
*   Include a more explicit and detailed discussion of the limitations of the theoretical results and the empirical findings.
*   Explore the potential connections between identifiable SDSs and areas like reinforcement learning.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a valuable contribution to the field of latent variable modeling. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, the empirical validation is compelling, and the paper is generally well-written. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact. I recommend acceptance, pending minor revisions based on the suggestions provided.
