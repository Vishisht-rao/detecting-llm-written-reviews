## Review of "Economics Arena for Large Language Models"

This paper proposes an interesting and novel approach to evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) by embedding them within simulated economic games. The authors argue that static benchmarks fail to capture the adaptive capabilities of LLMs, and that competitive games provide a dynamic environment to assess rationality, strategic reasoning, and instruction-following. By implementing an "Economics Arena" with second-price auctions and beauty contest games, the paper attempts to quantify these abilities across a range of popular LLMs.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The idea of using economic games as a dynamic evaluation benchmark for LLMs is innovative and promising. It moves beyond static datasets and explores more complex interaction patterns.
*   **Clearly Defined Metrics:** The paper clearly defines metrics for rationality (deviation from Nash Equilibrium), strategic reasoning (payoff changes with game history), and instruction following (rule-breaking frequency). This allows for quantitative analysis and comparison of different LLMs.
*   **Comprehensive Experiments:** The experiments cover a reasonable selection of LLMs and game configurations. The manipulation of game history, opponent rationality, and game parameters provides valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of each model.
*   **Interesting Observations:** The paper identifies several interesting trends, such as the non-maximally rational behavior of LLMs even with rational opponents, the adaptation of LLMs to dynamic environments, and the differing levels of strategic reasoning based on game history. The observations regarding GPT3.5's performance across various scenarios and Claude2's rapid learning are particularly noteworthy.
*   **Publicly Available Simulation Package:** The development of the EconArena as a publicly available simulation package is a valuable contribution to the LLM research community, enabling further exploration and evaluation of LLMs in competitive settings.
*   **Clear Writing:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, clearly outlining the methodology, experiments, and results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Game Variety:** While the choice of second-price auctions and beauty contest games provides a solid foundation, the current implementation lacks variety. Exploring other economic games, such as Prisoner's Dilemma or bargaining games, could broaden the scope of the evaluation and uncover different aspects of LLM behavior.
*   **Prompt Sensitivity:** The results are likely sensitive to the specific prompts used. The paper acknowledges this limitation but could benefit from a more thorough investigation of prompt engineering techniques and their impact on LLM behavior. Exploring the use of different prompts to elicit rationality, strategic thinking, and instruction following would strengthen the robustness of the findings.
*   **Limited Explanation for certain observations:** Some of the explanations for observed behaviours are speculative. For example, the paper mentions the decrease in average payoffs for stronger models (GPT3.5, Claude2 and GPT4) upon adding game history but doesn't explore other possible causes other than “slight improvement in other LLMs”. Statistical significance testing would aid in strengthening the analysis.
*   **Lack of Discussion on Sample Complexity:** How many games does each LLM need to play to accurately assess its rationality and strategic reasoning abilities? The paper would benefit from a discussion of sample complexity and the implications of using a limited number of games.
*   **Absence of "convergence guarantees"**: The paper does not appear to offer formal "convergence guarantees" with their proposed evaluation setup and thus lacks theoretical analysis supporting the experimental results and conclusions.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand Game Variety:** Implement additional economic games in the EconArena to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of LLMs.
*   **Investigate Prompt Sensitivity:** Conduct a systematic study of prompt engineering techniques and their impact on LLM behavior in the games.
*   **Statistical Significance Testing:** Include statistical significance testing to strengthen claims regarding performance differences between LLMs.
*   **Discuss Sample Complexity:** Address the issue of sample complexity and the implications of using a limited number of games for evaluation.
*   **Address Rule-Following Failures:** Further investigate the reasons behind the rule-breaking behavior of certain LLMs and explore methods to improve their instruction-following capabilities.
*   **Real-world Application Discussion:** Elaborate on potential applications of the game-based evaluation methodology to real-world scenarios.

**Overall Assessment:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and promising approach to evaluating LLMs. The proposed "Economics Arena" provides a valuable tool for assessing rationality, strategic reasoning, and instruction-following in a dynamic environment. While there are some limitations, the strengths of the paper outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, pending consideration of the suggestions for improvement. The paper has the potential to stimulate further research in this area and contribute to a better understanding of the capabilities and limitations of LLMs.
