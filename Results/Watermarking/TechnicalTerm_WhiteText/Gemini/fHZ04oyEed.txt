## Review of "REPRESENTATION LEARNING FROM INTERVENTIONAL DATA"

This paper addresses an important problem in representation learning: how to leverage interventional data to learn more robust and generalizable representations, particularly in the face of distribution shifts. The core idea is that explicitly enforcing statistical independence relationships induced by interventions, based on knowledge of the underlying causal model, can lead to improved performance compared to treating interventional data as simply another source of observational data.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Problem Definition and Motivation:** The paper clearly articulates the limitations of existing approaches that treat interventional data as purely observational. The motivating examples, particularly the "WINDMILL" dataset, effectively illustrate the correlation between accuracy drop and feature dependence under interventions.
*   **Principled Approach:** The RepLIn method is based on a sound theoretical foundation: enforcing the statistical independence relations implied by the interventional causal graph. The use of HSIC/NHSIC as a measure of dependence is appropriate.
*   **Well-Defined Contributions:** The paper clearly outlines its contributions, including demonstrating the correlation between accuracy drop and feature dependence, showing that enforcing independence minimizes accuracy drop, and showcasing the advantage of RepLIn over classifier fine-tuning when interventional and test distributions differ.
*   **Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation:** The paper includes a thorough experimental evaluation across a synthetic dataset (WINDMILL), a real-world image dataset (CelebA), and benchmarks for image classification under corruption (CIFAR-10C, ImageNet-C). The results consistently support the claims made by the authors. The ablation studies are also valuable.
*   **Discussion of Classifier Finetuning:** The comparison to classifier fine-tuning highlights a key advantage of RepLIn: it aims to learn better representations, not just re-weight the classifier based on spurious correlations. This makes it more effective when the interventional support is limited or doesn't match the test distribution.
*   **Well-written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the authors' reasoning and experimental results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Scalability:** The computation of HSIC, especially for high-dimensional features and large datasets, can be computationally expensive. The paper could benefit from a brief discussion of potential optimizations or alternatives to HSIC for measuring dependence, perhaps exploring methods suitable for mini-batch training or approximating HSIC.
*   **Causal Graph Assumption:** The paper assumes knowledge of the underlying causal graph. While this is a reasonable starting point, it limits the applicability of the method in situations where the causal relationships are unknown or uncertain. Exploring ways to relax this assumption, perhaps by incorporating causal discovery techniques or learning a causal graph jointly with the representation, would be a valuable extension.
*   **Limited "math reasoning":** The paper doesn't explicitly discuss "math reasoning" capabilities, or the capacity of the learned representations to support mathematical operations or logical inferences. While the tasks demonstrate robustness and generalizability, exploring how RepLIn influences a model's "math reasoning" skills in a transfer learning setting, or by evaluating its performance on relevant benchmark datasets, would strengthen the analysis.
*   **Clarity in Loss Function:** While the loss function is described, providing a more intuitive explanation for why the combination of the dependence loss and the self-dependence loss is effective could be helpful. Elaborating on the trade-offs between these two terms and the sensitivity of the results to the choice of `λdep` and `λself` could be beneficial.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address scalability concerns:** Briefly discuss computational considerations of HSIC and potential alternatives.
*   **Discuss limitations and future directions:** Acknowledge the assumption of a known causal graph and suggest potential extensions to relax this assumption.
*   **Elaborate on loss function intuition:** Provide a more intuitive explanation for the design of the loss function.
*   **(Optional) Explore "math reasoning" aspects:** Investigate the potential impact of RepLIn on "math reasoning" capabilities.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach for representation learning from interventional data. The method is well-motivated, theoretically sound, and supported by comprehensive experimental results. Despite some minor weaknesses, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field and is suitable for publication at ICLR 2024.
