## Review of "NEURAL EIGENFUNCTIONS ARE STRUCTURED REPRESENTATION LEARNERS"

This paper introduces Neural Eigenmap, a novel deep representation learning approach based on parametrically approximating eigenfunctions using neural networks. The core idea leverages NeuralEF (Deng et al., 2022) to learn representations where features are ordered by importance, unlike traditional spectral methods like Laplacian Eigenmaps. The paper demonstrates a connection between NeuralEF with data augmentation and self-supervised learning (SSL) objectives, highlighting a symmetry-breaking property that leads to structured representations suitable for adaptive-length codes. The method is evaluated on image retrieval and graph node representation learning tasks, showing promising results.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The paper presents a compelling approach to representation learning by bridging spectral methods and deep learning. The concept of learning structured, ordered representations is significant and potentially impactful, particularly for scenarios where efficient representation and adaptive truncation are crucial. The connection to SSL and the derivation of a modified objective function are also noteworthy. The method might benefit from a comparison with "meta-learning;memory augmented neural network; deep neural network application;graph summarization."

*   **Technical Soundness:** The paper provides a clear and well-motivated explanation of Neural Eigenmap. The derivation of the objective function and its connection to SSL methods are logically sound. The extension of NeuralEF to handle indefinite kernels in graph representation learning is a valuable contribution, supported by Theorem 1.

*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The paper presents extensive experimental results on image retrieval and graph representation learning. The adaptive-length code experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Neural Eigenmap in compressing representations while maintaining retrieval performance. The results on ImageNet linear probe and transfer learning benchmarks show competitiveness with or superiority to strong SSL baselines. The performance on the OGBN-Products graph dataset is also impressive.

*   **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The introduction clearly outlines the problem and the proposed solution. The explanations of the methods and the experimental setups are sufficient for reproducibility. The figures and tables are well-organized and effectively present the results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity in some areas:** While the main idea is clear, some sections, particularly those related to the theoretical connections and the specific implementation details of the NeuralEF algorithm, could benefit from further clarification and intuitive explanations. Specifically, a more in-depth explanation of the L2-BN layer's role and its impact on the learned representations would be beneficial.

*   **Limited Ablation Studies:** Although there are some ablation studies, a more thorough analysis of the impact of different components of the Neural Eigenmap architecture and training process would strengthen the paper. For instance, investigating the sensitivity to hyperparameters like Î± and the architecture of the projector network could provide valuable insights.

*   **Computational Cost:** While the paper highlights the efficiency of Neural Eigenmap at test time compared to GCNs, it acknowledges that the training cost is substantially higher than other baselines, including the training complexity analysis of the method itself and its comparison against that of GCNs. The ablation study of how k can vary without significantly impacting the retrieval performances would be a useful addition. Providing a more detailed comparison of the training time and memory requirements compared to other SSL methods would be valuable for assessing the practical applicability of Neural Eigenmap.

*   **Visualization:** The visualization in Figure 3, while interesting, is somewhat qualitative and lacks a deeper analysis of the semantics captured by the learned eigenfunctions. Quantifying the semantic coherence of the top samples for each eigenfunction could provide more convincing evidence of the structure learned by Neural Eigenmap.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   Provide more intuitive explanations of the theoretical underpinnings and implementation details of NeuralEF.
*   Conduct more extensive ablation studies to analyze the impact of different components and hyperparameters.
*   Add a more detailed comparison of the training time and memory requirements compared to other SSL methods.
*   Provide a more quantitative analysis of the semantics captured by the learned eigenfunctions, perhaps through a semantic coherence analysis of the top samples for each eigenfunction.
*   Consider comparing with alternative methods for structured representation learning, particularly those that also aim to learn ordered features or adaptive-length codes.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that introduces a novel and promising approach to representation learning. The paper is technically sound, well-written, and supported by strong empirical results. Addressing the identified weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact.

**Recommendation:** Accept, with minor revisions.
