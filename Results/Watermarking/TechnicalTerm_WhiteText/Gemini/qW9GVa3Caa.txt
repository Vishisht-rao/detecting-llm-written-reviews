## Review of "Prototype Generation: Robust Feature Visualisation for Data-Independent Interpretability"

This paper introduces "Prototype Generation," a novel approach to feature visualization designed to be more robust and data-independent than existing methods. The core idea is to generate inputs that maximize the output logit for a specific class while maintaining internal activations similar to those of natural images. The authors argue this addresses criticisms of traditional feature visualization, which can produce unnatural activations and potentially misleading interpretations. They support their claims with quantitative experiments measuring the similarity between generated prototypes and natural images, and demonstrate how these prototypes can reveal biases and spurious correlations learned by the model.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Problem Definition:** The paper effectively highlights the limitations of existing feature visualization techniques and motivates the need for a more robust and reliable approach. The authors clearly articulate the concern that feature visualizations might not accurately reflect the model's internal representations and thus could lead to incorrect interpretations.
*   **Novelty of Approach:** The proposed Prototype Generation method offers a compelling alternative to traditional feature visualization. Constraining the optimization process to generate prototypes with natural-like activations is a promising way to address the "unnaturalness" critique.
*   **Quantitative Evaluation:** The paper goes beyond qualitative assessment and provides quantitative evidence to support its claims. The use of Spearman similarity and L1 distance to measure the similarity of internal activations is a strong point, allowing for direct comparison with existing work (e.g., Geirhos et al., 2023). The experimental results show that the generated prototypes indeed exhibit higher path similarity to natural images compared to prototypes generated by other methods.
*   **Demonstration of Practical Value:** The case study on academic gowns and mortarboards convincingly demonstrates how Prototype Generation can be used to uncover biases and potential failure modes in a model. The ability to identify these issues *without* relying on a specific test set is a significant advantage, highlighting the data-independent nature of the approach.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The structure is logical, and the key concepts are clearly explained. The inclusion of flowcharts and visual examples aids in understanding the proposed method.
* **Implicitly Addresses "Text-Driven Video Editing":** The case study relating the academic gown prototype to light skinned faces and the mortar board to faces in general implicitly addresses *text-driven video editing* via revealing underlying, potentially problematic relationships between class prototypes (e.g. gowns and skin tone).

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Scope of Evaluation:** While the case study provides valuable insights, the evaluation is somewhat limited. Expanding the case studies to include more diverse datasets and models would strengthen the claims.
*   **Lack of Formal Guarantees:** The authors acknowledge that they cannot provide formal guarantees that Prototype Generation will consistently offer useful insights across all use cases. While this honesty is appreciated, further discussion of the limitations of the method and potential failure modes would be beneficial.
*   **Limited Exploration of the Diversity Objective:** The diversity objective, aimed at generating varied prototypes, appears to have yielded limited results. The authors should provide more insight into why this approach was not more effective and explore alternative diversity-promoting techniques.
*   **Parameter Sensitivity:** The process of selecting regularization parameters seems somewhat ad-hoc. A more systematic analysis of the sensitivity of the results to different parameter settings would enhance the robustness of the study.
* **Hyperparameter Choice:** While parameters are listed in the appendix, there is not a comprehensive description or justification for the choices that were made.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand the case studies:** Include more diverse datasets and models in the case studies to demonstrate the generalizability of the approach.
*   **Discuss limitations in more detail:** Provide a more in-depth discussion of the limitations of Prototype Generation, including potential failure modes and situations where it might not be effective.
*   **Explore alternative diversity-promoting techniques:** Investigate alternative methods for generating varied prototypes that capture the entire range of features relevant for a class.
*   **Conduct a more systematic parameter sensitivity analysis:** Perform a more thorough analysis of the sensitivity of the results to different regularization parameter settings.
*   **Address "fooling circuits":** Acknowledge the fooling circuits concern from Geirhos et al. (2023) in the discussion section.
* **Provide stronger justification for hyperparameter choices.**

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that introduces a novel and promising approach to feature visualization. The Prototype Generation method addresses important limitations of existing techniques and offers a valuable tool for understanding and interpreting deep learning models. While there are some areas for improvement, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of interpretability and is worthy of acceptance.

**Recommendation:** Accept (with minor revisions)
