## Review of "KNOWLEDGE DISTILLATION BASED ON TRANSFORMED TEACHER MATCHING"

**Summary:**

This paper introduces a novel knowledge distillation (KD) technique called Transformed Teacher Matching (TTM) and its weighted variant, WTTM. The core idea is to drop temperature scaling on the student side during KD, which the authors argue introduces an inherent Rényi entropy regularization term into the distillation objective. They theoretically justify this approach by reinterpreting temperature scaling as a power transform of the probability distribution. Experimental results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate that TTM outperforms standard KD, and WTTM further improves upon TTM, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Insightful Analysis:** The paper presents a novel perspective on temperature scaling in KD, offering a theoretical justification for dropping it on the student side. The connection to Rényi entropy regularization is insightful and provides a compelling explanation for the observed performance gains. The reinterpretation of temperature scaling as a power transform is clever.
*   **Clear Theoretical Justification:** The paper provides a well-structured theoretical derivation showing that TTM is equivalent to KD plus Rényi entropy regularization. This distinguishes it from previous works that dropped temperature scaling without rigorous justification.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The experimental results are comprehensive and convincing. The paper benchmarks TTM and WTTM against a wide range of existing KD techniques on two standard datasets. The results consistently show that TTM outperforms KD, and WTTM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, especially when combined with other distillation losses like CRD and ITRD. The results demonstrating consistent improvement with better teachers are compelling.
*   **Well-written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The motivation, methodology, and results are clearly presented.
*   **Code Availability:** The availability of the source code is a significant plus for reproducibility and further research.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Discussion of Related Work:** While the paper mentions several related works, a deeper discussion of the nuances and differences between TTM/WTTM and other recent advances in KD could strengthen the paper. For example, more comparison to label smoothing methods could be included.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** It would be beneficial to include a sensitivity analysis of the hyperparameters, particularly the temperature *T* (or equivalently, γ) and the weighting coefficient β. Understanding how these parameters affect performance could provide valuable insights for practitioners.
*   **Limited Discussion of Computational Overhead:** While the paper mentions that WTTM has almost the same computational complexity as KD, a more detailed analysis of the computational overhead, especially for large-scale datasets, would be helpful.
*   **Lack of Discussion on "diffusion model; content suppression; image editing; text embeddings":** While the results are good, the paper is missing a discussion on the applications of their method to "diffusion model; content suppression; image editing; text embeddings". The paper could be significantly stronger by including a section on this.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand the Discussion of Related Work:** Provide a more detailed comparison of TTM/WTTM with other recent KD techniques, particularly those based on label smoothing or feature-based distillation.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis:** Include a sensitivity analysis of the hyperparameters, showing how performance varies with different values of *T* and β.
*   **Computational Overhead Analysis:** Provide a more detailed analysis of the computational overhead of WTTM, especially for large-scale datasets.
*   **Address the applications of this method to "diffusion model; content suppression; image editing; text embeddings":** Even a brief section on this could significantly improve the appeal and impact of this paper.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective knowledge distillation technique. The theoretical justification is sound, and the experimental results are convincing. The weaknesses are relatively minor and can be addressed with further analysis and discussion. The paper is well-suited for publication at ICLR.
