## Review: PTARL: Prototype-Based Tabular Representation Learning via Space Calibration

This paper presents PTARL, a novel prototype-based tabular representation learning framework designed to address representation entanglement and localization challenges prevalent in existing deep tabular ML methods. The core idea revolves around constructing a prototype-based projection space (P-Space) and learning disentangled representations around global data prototypes using Optimal Transport. The paper proposes two key strategies: a diversification constraint for representation calibration within P-Space and a matrix orthogonalization constraint to ensure the independence of global prototypes. Experimental results demonstrate consistent performance improvements when PTARL is coupled with state-of-the-art deep tabular ML models across various benchmarks.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses a Clear Problem:** The paper effectively identifies and articulates the limitations of existing deep tabular ML methods, specifically representation entanglement and localization. These issues are well-motivated and supported by empirical observations (as seen in Figure 1).
*   **Novel Approach:** The application of prototype learning to tabular ML is a relatively unexplored area and provides a fresh perspective on representation learning for this data type. The idea of using a P-Space with global prototypes as basis vectors is innovative.
*   **Well-Defined Framework:** The PTARL framework is clearly explained, with a logical progression from prototype generation to representation projection. The use of Optimal Transport for capturing global data structure is a sound approach.
*   **Constraint-Based Disentanglement:** The diversification and orthogonalization constraints are well-motivated and contribute significantly to the disentangled nature of the learned representations.
*   **Model-Agnostic:** The model-agnostic nature of PTARL is a significant strength, allowing it to be integrated with various deep tabular ML models and demonstrating its broad applicability.
*   **Comprehensive Experiments:** The experimental setup is well-designed, utilizing a diverse set of tabular datasets and baseline models. The ablation studies effectively demonstrate the contribution of each component of PTARL.
*   **Clear Visualizations:** The visualizations (Figures 1, 3, 4, and 5) effectively illustrate the core concepts and the impact of PTARL on learned representations and prototype relationships.
*   **The paper addresses a known problem of representation disentanglement and localization in tabular data.**

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Computational Complexity Discussion:** While the paper mentions the computational complexity of Optimal Transport, a more detailed analysis of the overall computational overhead introduced by PTARL would be beneficial. The reported per-epoch training times provide some insight, but a direct comparison of training time with and without PTARL for the same baseline model would be stronger.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** While sensitivity analysis is done on loss weights,  The paper could benefit from further discussion regarding the sensitivity of PTARL to other key hyperparameters, such as the number of prototypes *K* or parameters within the estimator phi.  The sensitivity to K is touched on in A.6 but it would be better to have that within the main paper.
*   **"Multi-Turn Interaction" Absent:** It's notable that the paper does not address scenarios involving "multi-turn interaction" within the tabular data. While not necessarily a requirement, acknowledging the potential applicability (or inapplicability) of PTARL to such contexts would strengthen the discussion. If the tabular data represents a series of interactions, it would be relevant to consider how the global prototypes capture information across these turns.
*   **Optimal Transport Implementation Details:** Further details about the Optimal Transport implementation used (e.g., specific solver, regularization parameters) would be helpful for reproducibility.
*   **The paper is very technical which might make it hard to follow for a general audience.**

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand Computational Complexity Analysis:** Provide a more detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by PTARL, including a direct comparison of training time with and without PTARL for the same baseline model.
*   **Address Hyperparameter Sensitivity:**  Discuss the sensitivity of PTARL to key hyperparameters, particularly the number of prototypes *K* and parameters within the estimator phi.
*   **Acknowledge "Multi-Turn Interaction" Scenarios:** Briefly discuss the potential applicability (or inapplicability) of PTARL to tabular data involving "multi-turn interaction."
*   **Provide Optimal Transport Implementation Details:** Include details about the Optimal Transport implementation used (e.g., specific solver, regularization parameters).
*   **Simplify the technical writing, to make the paper more broadly accessible.**

**Overall:**

PTARL is a promising framework for tabular representation learning that effectively addresses the challenges of representation entanglement and localization. The paper is well-written, clearly explains the proposed method, and provides strong experimental evidence to support its effectiveness. Despite the minor weaknesses, the novelty and potential impact of PTARL make it a valuable contribution to the field of tabular ML.

**Recommendation:**

Accept (Poster Presentation) - The paper presents a novel and effective approach to tabular representation learning.
