## Review of "HIGEN: Hierarchical Graph Generative Networks"

This paper proposes a novel graph generative network, HiGen, designed to capture the hierarchical nature of graphs, a feature often overlooked by existing methods. The core idea involves generating graphs in a coarse-to-fine manner, successively generating graph sub-structures at each level of a hierarchy. The model generates communities in parallel, followed by the prediction of cross-edges between communities using separate neural networks. This modular approach, coupled with a recursive factorization of the multinomial distribution for edge weights, is presented as enabling scalable graph generation, especially for large and complex graphs with integer-valued edge weights. The authors claim state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark datasets.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Relevance:** The paper addresses a significant limitation in existing graph generative models â€“ the lack of explicit modeling of hierarchical structure. The idea of generating graphs in a coarse-to-fine manner, leveraging community structure, is a promising approach. The authors correctly identify the importance of hierarchical structures in real-world graphs.
*   **Sound Methodology:** The proposed method is based on solid theoretical foundations. The authors provide detailed derivations and proofs for their theorems, especially the factorization of the multinomial distribution for edge weights. The use of multinomial distributions to model integer-valued edge weights is a unique and potentially beneficial aspect of the approach.
*   **Scalability:** The parallel generation of communities is a key design choice that potentially addresses the scalability limitations of many existing graph generative models, particularly autoregressive ones. The complexity analysis provided supports this claim.
*   **Strong Experimental Results:** The paper presents a comprehensive set of experiments comparing HiGen with several state-of-the-art baselines on various synthetic and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that HiGen achieves competitive or superior performance across different graph statistics metrics. The ablation studies offer further insights into the model's behavior.
*   **Clear Presentation (mostly):** The paper is generally well-written and clearly explains the core concepts and methodology. The figures, particularly Figure 1, help illustrate the hierarchical graph generation process. The algorithms presented in the appendix also help to clarify the method. The authors also touch upon the topic of "neural 3d reconstruction" when discussing related works in computer vision.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors provide a link to their code repository, a detailed appendix with proofs and model architecture specifications, and comprehensive experimental details. These elements contribute to the reproducibility of the research.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity in certain sections:** Some parts of the method explanation, particularly the equations related to community generation (e.g., equation 6 and following paragraphs), can be difficult to follow without a very careful reading. More intuitive explanations or diagrams could improve clarity.
*   **Partitioning Method Dependency:** While the ablation study shows some robustness to different partitioning functions, the model's performance still relies on a good partitioning of the graph. The choice of the Louvain algorithm, while computationally efficient, might not always be optimal. Further discussion on the sensitivity to partitioning quality and potential ways to improve the partitioning step would be beneficial.
*   **Edge Independence Assumption:** The assumption of conditional independence between bipartites (following community generation) could be a limiting factor. While the authors argue that this is reasonable for graphs where dependencies are mostly local, it's not clear if this holds true for all graph types. A more thorough discussion of the implications of this assumption and potential strategies to mitigate its impact would strengthen the paper. The experiments on the point cloud dataset are a step in the right direction, but further analysis would be valuable.
*   **Related Work:** While the related work section is decent, it could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other hierarchical graph generation approaches, especially those used in molecular graph generation. A more nuanced discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of HiGen compared to these methods would be helpful.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Improve Clarity:** Revise the explanation of the community generation process, particularly equations 5-7, to make it more intuitive and easier to understand. Consider adding more diagrams or examples.
*   **Address Partitioning Dependency:** Provide a more in-depth discussion of the impact of the graph partitioning method on the model's performance. Explore alternative partitioning techniques or strategies to improve the partitioning step.
*   **Discuss Edge Independence:** Expand the discussion on the edge independence assumption for bipartites. Analyze the potential limitations of this assumption and suggest strategies to address them.
*   **Strengthen Related Work:** Provide a more detailed and comparative analysis of related work, especially other hierarchical graph generation methods.
*   **Address Edge case in Algorithm 2:** Clarify the purpose of steps 15-26 in Algorithm 2. It's not entirely clear what these steps do within the sampling process.
*   **Proofread Carefully:** There are a few minor grammatical errors and typos throughout the paper. A careful proofread would improve the overall quality.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Despite the weaknesses mentioned above, the paper presents a novel and promising approach to graph generation with strong experimental results. The idea of capturing hierarchical structure in graphs is relevant and the proposed method has the potential to significantly advance the field. Therefore, I recommend **acceptance** with the suggestion that the authors address the weaknesses outlined above to further strengthen the paper.
