## Review of "De Novo Protein Design Using Geometric Vector Field Networks"

This paper presents a novel protein structure encoder, the Vector Field Network (VFN), aimed at improving de novo protein design. The core innovation lies in the "vector field operator," which performs learnable vector computations between coordinates of frame-anchored virtual atoms, addressing a perceived "atom representation bottleneck" in existing methods like IPA. The paper demonstrates improved performance on both protein diffusion and inverse folding tasks, suggesting that VFN offers a more expressive and versatile approach to protein structure encoding.

**Strengths:**

* **Novel Architecture:** The VFN introduces a potentially significant improvement over existing frame-based encoders by enabling learnable vector computations. The "vector field operator" appears to be a well-designed module that allows for flexible geometric feature extraction.
* **Clear Problem Definition:** The paper clearly articulates the challenges in de novo protein design, particularly the limitations of current encoders in handling frame-based representations prevalent in protein diffusion. The concept of the "atom representation bottleneck" is clearly explained.
* **Strong Experimental Results:** The paper presents compelling experimental evidence for VFN's superior performance. The results on both protein diffusion (designability and diversity) and inverse folding (sequence recovery rate) are significantly better than existing methods, including IPA and PiFold.  The ablation studies further validate the design choices of the VFN. The claim of surpassing SoTA in multiple tasks is well supported by the reported metrics.
* **Well-written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making the proposed method and the experimental setup relatively easy to understand. The figures and tables are helpful in illustrating the results and the architecture of the VFN. The inclusion of pseudocode aids in understanding the core algorithmic differences between VFN and IPA.
* **Code Availability:** The availability of the code on GitHub encourages reproducibility and further research.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited Discussion of RFDiffusion:** While the authors address why they don't directly compare with RFDiffusion, the limited discussion feels somewhat dismissive. Given that RFDiffusion is a prominent recent development, a more in-depth analysis of the architectural differences and potential complementarities would strengthen the paper. Specifically, it would be beneficial to discuss how VFN might be integrated into or compared with RFDiffusion's framework.
* **Lack of Ablation on Node/Edge Attention:** While the paper explains why node and edge attention are kept in VFN-Diff, it would have been more convincing to see an ablation that truly removes them. Showing performance with and without these components would more clearly isolate the impact of the VFN layer itself.
* **Limited Discussion of "Retrieval Augmented Language Model" applicability:**  The paper could benefit from exploring the potential of VFN within a broader framework.  While the authors achieve improvements using an ESM-based approach, the potential integration of VFN with methods that leverage external databases or "retrieval augmented language model" techniques is not discussed.  How could VFN be used in conjunction with large protein sequence databases to further enhance de novo design capabilities?
* **Scalability Concerns (Implied):** While the paper shows good performance with a larger VFN-IF model trained on the entire PDB database, there is no clear discussion on the computational demands for scaling VFN. Is the "vector field operator" computationally expensive compared to other attention mechanisms? Addressing potential scalability limitations would be valuable.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective protein structure encoder with significant potential for advancing de novo protein design. The "vector field operator" is a creative solution to the "atom representation bottleneck" and the experimental results clearly demonstrate the superiority of the VFN. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above, particularly a more thorough discussion of RFDiffusion and potential integration with "retrieval augmented language model" approaches, would further enhance the paper. I recommend acceptance for publication.
