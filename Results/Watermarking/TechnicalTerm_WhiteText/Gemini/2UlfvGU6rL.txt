## Review of "Equivariant Graph Neural Operator for Modeling 3D Dynamics"

This paper presents Equivariant Graph Neural Operator (EGNO), a novel approach for modeling 3D dynamics of relational systems.  The core idea is to formulate dynamics as a function over time and learn a neural operator, specifically leveraging Fourier neural operators (FNOs), to approximate this function while maintaining SE(3) equivariance. The authors convincingly demonstrate the superiority of EGNO over existing methods across various domains, including particle simulations, human motion capture, and molecular dynamics.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Soundness:**  The proposed EGNO is a well-motivated and novel approach.  The integration of FNOs with equivariant GNNs to directly model trajectories, rather than just next-step predictions, is a significant contribution. The theoretical justification for the equivariance of the temporal convolutions is also strong and clearly presented.
*   **Clarity and Organization:** The paper is generally well-written and organized.  The introduction effectively sets the stage and highlights the limitations of existing methods. The related work section is relevant and comprehensive. The explanation of the EGNO architecture and its components is clear and easy to follow. The figures and illustrations are helpful in understanding the proposed method.
*   **Strong Experimental Results:**  The comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of EGNO. The consistent improvement over existing methods, particularly EGNN and its variants, is compelling.  The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the importance of the different components of EGNO. The analysis of data efficiency and temporal discretization is thorough.
*   **Practical Advantages:** The paper clearly articulates the practical advantages of EGNO, including the ability to efficiently decode future states in parallel, the flexibility to handle different temporal discretizations, and the ease of integration with various EGNN layers.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Missing Discussion of Limitations:** The paper would benefit from a more explicit discussion of the limitations of EGNO.  For example, are there specific types of dynamics or system complexities where EGNO might struggle?  What are the computational costs of EGNO compared to simpler methods, particularly in terms of memory usage with larger numbers of nodes? Addressing these points would further strengthen the paper.
*   **Limited Visualizations:**  While the visualizations in the appendix are helpful, adding a representative qualitative result directly into the main text could further emphasize the benefits of trajectory modeling.  A more detailed visualization of the learned Fourier kernels could also be insightful.
*   **Absence of Discussion about "Video Decomposition":** The paper would benefit from discussing the relationship between EGNO and concepts like "video decomposition," although it doesn't directly mention them. For example, how would EGNO perform compared to methods that explicitly decompose a video into components (e.g., foreground, background, objects) and model their dynamics separately?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Add a section on limitations:**  Discuss potential challenges and limitations of EGNO, including computational costs and types of dynamics where it might not perform optimally.
*   **Include a representative visualization in the main text:**  Showcase a compelling visual example of EGNO's trajectory prediction capabilities directly within the paper.
*   **Expand the discussion of discretization invariance:**  Elaborate on the practical implications of the discretization invariance property of FNOs in the context of EGNO. Provide more details on the experiments on zero-shot generalization towards discretization steps (section C.4).
*   **Consider discussing "video decomposition"-related ideas:** Relate EGNO to other forms of dynamics modeling, particularly those that involve component decomposition, even if only briefly.

**Overall Assessment:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach for modeling 3D dynamics. The theoretical foundations are sound, the experimental results are compelling, and the practical advantages are clear.  Addressing the minor weaknesses mentioned above would further enhance the paper and make it an even more valuable contribution to the field. I recommend acceptance.
