## Review of "ENCODING EXPERT KNOWLEDGE INTO FEDERATED LEARNING USING WEAK SUPERVISION"

This paper tackles a challenging and important problem: how to effectively incorporate expert knowledge into federated learning (FL) settings where data resides on-device and cannot be directly accessed for annotation. The paper proposes Weak Supervision Heuristics for Federated Learning (WSHFL), a method that leverages programmatic weak supervision (PWS) and interactive mining of labeling functions (LFs) to annotate on-device data in a cross-device federated setting. The work is novel and addresses a significant gap in current FL research, which often relies on unsupervised methods or makes unrealistic assumptions about the availability of labeled data at the client.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Formulation:** The paper clearly articulates the problem and motivates it well with a compelling example (arrhythmia detection using ECG data). The challenges of expert knowledge encoding in FL are well-defined.
*   **Novelty:** The core idea of incorporating PWS into FL is novel and promising. The proposed WSHFL method appears to be a good first step towards addressing this challenge. The paper correctly points out that previous PWS work has focused on centralized settings, and the exploration of its applicability in federated scenarios is a valuable contribution.
*   **Methodology:** The description of WSHFL is clear and well-structured. The two-stage process of LF mining and PWS model training is logical. The authors address key challenges such as generating candidate LFs in a federated scenario and selecting LFs for expert inspection. The active search formulation using a lower confidence bound is a reasonable approach. The use of WeaSEL as the PWS model allows for end-to-end training in a federated manner.
*   **Experimental Evaluation:** The experiments cover diverse data modalities (text and time-series) and utilize publicly available datasets. The comparisons against baselines (Random, Naive Greedy, and Supervised) provide a good understanding of WSHFL's performance. The ablation studies on different expert thresholds and the analysis of class imbalance are insightful. The authors clearly demonstrate WSHFL's ability to mine useful LFs and train competitive federated models. The appendix provides ample details about the datasets, models, and hyperparameters, increasing the reproducibility of the work. Comparisons with semi-supervised federated learning baselines in Appendix A.7 provide further evidence of the method's value.
*   **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, despite the technical complexity of the topic. The figures are helpful in visualizing the WSHFL process and the experimental results.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors commit to open-sourcing the code and provide an anonymous codebase for review. The detailed appendix with hyperparameter information further strengthens the reproducibility of the work.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Theoretical Justification:** While the approach is practical and shows promising results, a deeper theoretical justification for the proposed method would strengthen the paper. For example, how does the choice of the lower confidence bound influence the convergence properties of the LF mining process? Are there any guarantees on the quality of the mined LFs?
*   **Assumption about LF Independence:** The paper acknowledges the assumption of independence between estimates Ë†u<sub>j</sub> for a given aggregate.  However, the discussion could be expanded to analyze the potential impact of violations of this assumption in more detail.  What happens if client distributions change significantly over time?  What are the strategies to mitigate these effects?
*   **Expert Feedback:** The paper relies on a simulated expert with a fixed threshold. While this is a reasonable starting point, it would be beneficial to discuss the potential impact of different expert biases or levels of expertise on the performance of WSHFL.  Real-world expert feedback can be noisy and subjective. How robust is WSHFL to such variations?
*   **Parameter Sharing and Privacy:** The authors acknowledge the potential for private information leakage through parameter and LF sharing. While the discussion mentions differential privacy, it could be more concrete. Are there specific LF parameterizations that offer better privacy guarantees? How can the trade-off between privacy and utility be managed in WSHFL?
*   **Related Work:** The related work section is comprehensive, but there is no mention of how this work relates to the "neyman-pearson" lemma, in that it uses a hypothesis test to decide if a given LF is useful. The authors should explain in the future why that is not as relevant.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Provide a more detailed theoretical analysis of the LF mining process and its convergence properties.**
*   **Discuss the potential impact of violations of the LF independence assumption and strategies for mitigation.**
*   **Elaborate on the robustness of WSHFL to different expert biases and levels of expertise.** Consider including experiments with varying simulated expert behaviors.
*   **Provide a more concrete discussion of privacy considerations and potential mitigation strategies, such as differentially private LF parameterizations.**
*   **Explore alternative active search strategies for LF selection.** Are there more efficient methods for identifying useful LFs?
*   **Consider exploring the application of WSHFL to other data modalities and applications.**
*   **Discuss the limitations of the current approach and potential directions for future research.**

**Overall:**

This is a strong and novel paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of federated learning. The proposed WSHFL method is a promising approach for encoding expert knowledge into on-device data, addressing a crucial gap in current FL research. While there are some areas for improvement, the paper is well-written, clearly presented, and supported by solid experimental results. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the points raised above.
