## Review of "Contrastive Learning is Spectral Clustering on Similarity Graph"

This paper presents a compelling theoretical connection between contrastive learning, specifically the SimCLR framework, and spectral clustering. The authors rigorously prove that contrastive learning with the InfoNCE loss is equivalent to performing spectral clustering on a similarity graph derived from the data augmentation process. They extend this analysis to the multi-modal setting, demonstrating a similar equivalence for the CLIP model. Furthermore, motivated by their theoretical insights, the authors propose a new Kernel-InfoNCE loss that incorporates mixtures of kernel functions, achieving improved empirical performance on several vision datasets.

**Strengths:**

* **Strong Theoretical Contribution:** The paper's main strength lies in its rigorous theoretical proof connecting contrastive learning and spectral clustering. This provides a valuable understanding of the underlying mechanisms of contrastive learning and offers a new perspective on its effectiveness. The extension to the CLIP model further strengthens the theoretical contribution.
* **Clear and Well-Structured Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and logically structured. The authors clearly explain the background concepts, their assumptions, and their main results. The use of Figure 1 provides a helpful visual overview of their analysis.
* **Novel Kernel-InfoNCE Loss:** The proposed Kernel-InfoNCE loss, motivated by the theoretical analysis and the maximum entropy principle, offers a practical improvement over the standard Gaussian kernel. The empirical results demonstrating its superior performance are encouraging.
* **Relevance to the Community:** Contrastive learning is a significant and active area of research. This paper addresses a fundamental question about its theoretical underpinnings, making it highly relevant to the ICLR community.
* **Reproducibility:** The authors provide a link to their code and detailed experimental settings, enhancing the reproducibility of their results.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Finite Object Assumption:** The assumption of a finite number of objects, while acknowledged by the authors, could limit the generalizability of the results to continuous data augmentation schemes. While they mention that it can be easily extended to infinite cases, providing more details in the appendix or discussion would be beneficial.
* **Batch Size Discrepancy:** The paper acknowledges the discrepancy between the theoretical assumption of using all objects in the InfoNCE loss calculation and the practical implementation of using large batches. While they provide a reasonable explanation, exploring the impact of varying batch sizes on the equivalence to spectral clustering could be a potential direction for future work.
* **Limited Empirical Evaluation for LaCLIP:**  While the paper discusses the application of their theory to LaCLIP and correctly points out how it builds upon their findings, no experiments were conducted. It would be ideal to see if applying Kernel-InfoNCE to LaCLIP results in further improvements.
* **Discussion of "Nonparametric Learning":** The paper doesn't explicitly mention "nonparametric learning" but the connection between contrastive learning and spectral clustering hints at aspects of this. Spectral clustering, especially when considering the choice of kernel, can be seen as a "nonparametric learning" method where the model complexity grows with the data.  A brief discussion on this connection could add another layer of insight.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Elaborate on the "finite to infinite" extension:** Provide more detail in the appendix or discussion about how the results can be extended to the infinite case for continuous data augmentation.
* **Investigate the impact of batch size:**  Consider exploring the impact of varying batch sizes on the equivalence to spectral clustering, possibly through additional theoretical analysis or empirical studies.
* **Discuss nonparametric learning implications:** Include a brief discussion on the connection to "nonparametric learning", and how the kernel choice influences model complexity.
* **Consider experiments with Kernel-InfoNCE on LaCLIP:** If resources permit, testing the proposed kernel with LaCLIP would further validate your theory.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the theoretical understanding of contrastive learning. The rigorous proof, clear presentation, and novel Kernel-InfoNCE loss make it a valuable addition to the ICLR proceedings. Despite some minor weaknesses, the paper is well-deserving of acceptance.

**Recommendation:** Accept.
