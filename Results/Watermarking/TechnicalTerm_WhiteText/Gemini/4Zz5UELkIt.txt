## Review of "Adaptive Instrument Design for Indirect Experiments"

This paper addresses a critical and timely problem: how to efficiently design experiments in settings where direct treatment assignment is impractical or unethical, relying instead on indirect experiments with instrumental variables (IVs). The authors tackle the challenge of adaptively selecting instruments to improve the sample efficiency of treatment effect estimation, particularly when dealing with potentially high-dimensional instrument spaces and complex, non-linear estimators. The proposed approach, DIA (Designing Instruments Adaptively), leverages influence functions and multi-rejection sampling to optimize data collection policies over instruments, minimizing the mean-squared error (MSE) of the desired estimator.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Relevance and Significance:** The paper addresses a growing need for efficient causal inference in AI-augmented systems and other settings where human autonomy limits direct experimentation. The problem is well-motivated and clearly articulated.
*   **Novelty of Approach:** The paper introduces a novel framework for adaptive instrument selection that combines influence functions, multi-rejection sampling, and gradient-based optimization. This is a significant contribution, as adaptive experiment design for indirect experiments is relatively unexplored.
*   **Technical Depth and Rigor:** The paper presents a detailed technical analysis of the proposed method, including a theoretical justification for the variance reduction achieved by using influence functions and multi-rejection sampling. The derivation of influence functions for general two-stage estimators is a valuable contribution.
*   **Practicality and Scalability:** The authors emphasize the computational efficiency of their approach, highlighting the use of Hessian-vector products to avoid explicit computation and inversion of derivatives. The framework is designed to be compatible with deep neural networks, making it potentially scalable to high-dimensional instrument spaces.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of DIA through experiments in various domains, including synthetic, semi-synthetic (TripAdvisor), and conditional IV settings. The results show significant improvements in sample efficiency compared to uniform instrument allocation.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, with a clear explanation of the problem, approach, and results. Figures and tables are used effectively to illustrate key concepts and findings.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Synthetic Experiments Limitations:** While the empirical results are promising, the synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments may not fully capture the complexities of real-world applications. Further validation on larger, more realistic datasets would be beneficial.
*   **Assumptions and Limitations:** The paper makes several assumptions, such as static instrument impact and deterministic estimators. While the authors acknowledge these limitations and discuss potential extensions (e.g., stochastic estimates in Appendix H.2), it would be helpful to discuss the sensitivity of the results to violations of these assumptions. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of using influence functions as mentioned by Bae et al. and others.
*   **Missing Discussion of Related Neural ODEs:** Although not immediately obvious, the adaptive instrument design problem bears some similarities to optimal control problems in continuous state and action spaces. The paper could benefit from a brief discussion of how techniques used in solving "neural ordinary differential equation (ODE)" problems, particularly in reinforcement learning with continuous control, might relate to the proposed approach, if only to highlight the differences and justify the chosen methods.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Broader Empirical Evaluation:** Conduct experiments on larger, more complex datasets, potentially incorporating real-world data from AI-augmented systems or other relevant applications.
*   **Sensitivity Analysis:** Investigate the sensitivity of the results to violations of key assumptions, such as instrument validity and estimator consistency.
*   **Extension to Dynamic Instruments:** Explore how the framework can be extended to handle dynamic instruments, where the impact of the instrument may change over time.
*   **Comparison to Other Adaptive Experiment Design Techniques:** Provide a more detailed comparison of DIA to other adaptive experiment design techniques, particularly those used in direct experiments, highlighting the specific advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach.
*   **Connection to Optimal Control/Neural ODEs:** Briefly discuss the potential connections and differences between the proposed approach and optimal control methods using neural ODEs.
*   **Improved Discussion of Influence Function Limitations:** Acknowledge and address the potential issues with influence functions that prior work has identified, and clearly articulate the measures taken to mitigate these issues.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of causal inference and adaptive experiment design. The proposed framework, DIA, provides a practical and computationally efficient approach for adaptively selecting instruments in indirect experiments. While some limitations and suggestions for improvement exist, the paper presents a novel and valuable contribution that is likely to have a significant impact on the design of experiments in AI-augmented systems and other settings where direct experimentation is challenging. I recommend acceptance.
