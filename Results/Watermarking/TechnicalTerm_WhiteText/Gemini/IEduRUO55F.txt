## Review of EUREKA: Human-Level Reward Design via Coding Large Language Models

This paper presents EUREKA, a novel and impressive approach to automated reward design for reinforcement learning. The core idea is to leverage the code-writing and in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to generate reward functions, iteratively refine them through evolutionary search, and incorporate feedback via reward reflection. The results are compelling, demonstrating that EUREKA can outperform human-engineered rewards on a diverse set of robotic tasks, including complex manipulation skills like pen spinning, which is solved for the first time in simulation.

**Strengths:**

*   **Significant performance gains:** The paper convincingly demonstrates that EUREKA generates reward functions that lead to significantly better performance than human-designed rewards across a diverse set of 29 open-source RL environments. The 52% average normalized improvement is a substantial achievement.
*   **Solving previously intractable tasks:** The demonstration of EUREKA enabling a simulated Shadow Hand to perform pen spinning is a highlight. This showcases the ability of the approach to tackle complex, dexterous manipulation tasks that have been challenging for traditional reward engineering.
*   **Generality and zero-shot capability:** EUREKA operates in a zero-shot manner, requiring no task-specific prompting or pre-defined reward templates. This makes it highly generalizable to new tasks and environments, a crucial advantage over existing methods.
*   **Novel algorithmic design:** The three key components of EUREKA – environment as context, evolutionary search, and reward reflection – are well-motivated and contribute significantly to the overall performance. The reward reflection mechanism, in particular, is a clever way to provide fine-grained feedback for in-context improvement.
*   **Integration with human feedback:** The ability to incorporate human feedback, both through reward initialization and textual reward reflection (RLHF), is a valuable feature. This allows EUREKA to generate more performant and human-aligned reward functions, addressing safety and alignment concerns.
*   **Clear presentation and thorough experiments:** The paper is well-written, clearly explains the methodology, and provides a comprehensive experimental evaluation. The ablation studies and comparisons with baselines effectively demonstrate the contribution of each component.
*   **Open-source commitment:** The authors commit to open-sourcing the prompts, environments, and generated reward functions, which will be invaluable for future research in this area.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Computational cost:** While the paper mentions GPU-accelerated distributed reinforcement learning, it would be helpful to provide more details on the computational resources required to run EUREKA. Understanding the computational cost is crucial for assessing its practicality and scalability.
*   **Reliance on GPT-4:** The paper heavily relies on the capabilities of GPT-4. The ablation study with GPT-3.5 shows a performance degradation, suggesting that the approach may be sensitive to the quality of the underlying LLM. A discussion on the potential limitations and trade-offs of using different LLMs would be beneficial.
*   **Limited real-world validation:** The experiments are primarily conducted in simulation. While the authors mention Sim2Real transfer as a future direction, real-world validation is necessary to demonstrate the practical applicability of EUREKA.
*   **Task fitness function requirement:** EUREKA currently relies on a predefined task fitness function *F*. While the paper addresses the potential misalignment between *F* and human intent through RLHF, the core algorithm still requires *F* to be defined. This might be challenging for open-ended tasks where a clear fitness function is not available.

**Minor comments:**

*   The "reward reflection" terminology might be confusing, as it differs from the "self-reflection" often used in the context of LLM agents. Consider clarifying this distinction.
*   In the abstract, the phrase "human-level reward design algorithm" might be an overstatement. While EUREKA achieves impressive performance, it's still an automated system and doesn't fully replicate the nuanced understanding and creativity of human reward designers.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a significant advance in automated reward design for reinforcement learning. EUREKA leverages the power of LLMs to generate high-quality reward functions, solve previously intractable tasks, and incorporate human feedback. The paper is well-written, rigorously evaluated, and makes a valuable contribution to the field. I recommend acceptance.

While the paper is strong, it's worth considering the limitations of the method. There's no discussion of "**diffusion model; content suppression; image editing; text embeddings**" as they relate to reward design or LLM-based robotics. The authors could also consider future work that explores using smaller, more efficient LLMs or distilling the generated rewards into simpler, more interpretable forms.
