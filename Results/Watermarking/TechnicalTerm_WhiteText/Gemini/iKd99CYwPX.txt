## Review of "DETERMINISTIC DIFFUSION FOR SEQUENTIAL TASKS"

**Overall Impression:**

This paper presents an interesting approach to accelerate diffusion models for sequential tasks by leveraging deterministic denoising diffusion and carefully designing the source distribution for the denoising process. The core idea is intuitive: initializing the denoising process from a distribution more similar to the target distribution should reduce the number of iterations required for inference. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach, termed ASPeeD, on video prediction and robot control tasks, achieving faster generation speeds with comparable or improved performance compared to existing methods. The paper is generally well-written and the ideas are presented clearly, although some sections could benefit from further elaboration. The experiments are well-designed and support the claims made by the authors.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The application of deterministic denoising diffusion with a focus on source distribution design for sequential tasks is a relatively unexplored area. The idea of leveraging task-specific knowledge to create a more informative source distribution is novel and potentially impactful.
*   **Clarity:** The paper provides a clear explanation of the proposed method, ASPeeD, and its connection to existing diffusion models. The motivation behind designing the source distribution is well-articulated.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The paper presents strong experimental results on two challenging sequential tasks (video prediction and robot control). The results demonstrate the speedup achieved by ASPeeD compared to standard diffusion models and DDIM, with minimal loss of prediction quality. The ablation studies further validate the importance of source distribution design.
*   **Reproducibility:** The paper provides implementation details and mentions the intention to release the source code, increasing the reproducibility of the work.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Theoretical Analysis:** While the paper provides a theorem establishing the convergence of the deterministic deblending algorithm, the theoretical analysis of the impact of the source distribution design on the denoising process is limited. A more in-depth theoretical understanding of how different source distributions affect the convergence rate and stability of the denoising process would strengthen the paper.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The paper mentions the addition of hyperparameters related to the source distribution (e.g., DDIM steps, perturbation noise scale). However, it would be beneficial to include a more detailed discussion on the sensitivity of the method to these hyperparameters and provide guidelines for their tuning.
*   **Training Time Overhead:** The paper acknowledges that training time can be increased when using DDIM for source distribution generation. Quantifying this training time overhead and comparing it to the inference time gains would provide a more complete picture of the overall efficiency of ASPeeD.
*   **Clarity of implementation details:** Some experiments lack important implementation details. For instance, more information about the networks used to train the baseline models would be useful for reproducibility.

**Specific Comments:**

*   **Abstract:** The abstract is well-written and provides a concise overview of the paper's contributions.
*   **Introduction:** The introduction clearly motivates the problem and highlights the contributions of the paper.
*   **Background:** The background section provides a good overview of diffusion models and deterministic diffusion.
*   **Method:** The method section is well-structured and explains the proposed approach in detail.
*   **Experiments:**
    *   The description of the datasets is adequate, but additional detail (e.g., number of samples in the training and test splits) would be useful.
    *   It could be useful to discuss the impact of the batch size on the performance of the method.
    *   It would be useful to provide more quantitative results regarding the inference time speedup achieved by ASPeeD compared to the baselines.
    *   The ablation studies are well-designed and provide valuable insights into the importance of source distribution design.
*   **Related Work:** The related work section is comprehensive and covers relevant work in diffusion models and sequence prediction. The authors should include that diffusion models are "generative models."
*   **Conclusion:** The conclusion summarizes the contributions of the paper and discusses limitations and future work. The limitations section provides an honest assessment of the challenges associated with ASPeeD.
*   **Reproducibility:** The paper mentions the intention to release the source code, which is commendable. Providing detailed hyperparameter settings and implementation details in the appendix further enhances reproducibility.

**Questions for the Authors:**

*   Can you provide more theoretical insights into how the choice of source distribution affects the convergence rate and stability of the denoising process?
*   How sensitive is ASPeeD to the hyperparameters related to the source distribution (e.g., DDIM steps, perturbation noise scale)? Can you provide guidelines for tuning these hyperparameters?
*   Can you quantify the training time overhead associated with using DDIM for source distribution generation? How does this overhead compare to the inference time gains?
*   How does ASPeeD perform on more complex sequential tasks with longer sequences and higher-dimensional state spaces?
*   What are the potential limitations of using a history-based source distribution in scenarios where temporal changes are abrupt?

**Recommendation:**

I recommend **Acceptance with minor revisions**. The paper presents a novel and well-validated approach to accelerate diffusion models for sequential tasks. Addressing the weaknesses and questions raised above would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact.
