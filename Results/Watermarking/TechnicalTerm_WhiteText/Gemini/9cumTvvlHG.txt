## Review of "IMPLICIT CHAIN OF THOUGHT REASONING VIA KNOWLEDGE DISTILLATION"

This paper explores an intriguing alternative to explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Instead of generating intermediate, human-readable reasoning steps, the authors propose an "implicit chain-of-thought" (ICoT) approach where the reasoning process is embedded within the hidden states of the LLM. This approach is inspired by the compilation of explicit reasoning into intuitive thinking in humans. The paper leverages knowledge distillation to transfer the reasoning ability of a teacher model (trained with explicit CoT) to a student model that directly predicts the final answer, utilizing the teacher's hidden states as a guide.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Conceptual Contribution:** The core idea of implicit reasoning within LLM hidden states is novel and offers a compelling perspective on how LLMs can leverage their internal computational power. The analogy to human cognitive processes ("System 1" vs. "System 2" thinking) provides an intuitive framework for understanding the approach.
*   **Clear Problem Formulation and Methodology:** The paper clearly defines the problem and outlines a three-step strategy ("Mind-Reading the Teacher," "Thought Emulation," and "Couple and Optimize") to achieve ICoT. The description of each step is detailed and well-illustrated with a diagram.
*   **Promising Empirical Results:** The experiments on multi-digit multiplication and GSM8K demonstrate the potential of ICoT. The results show that the proposed method can significantly improve performance on tasks where direct prediction (no CoT) struggles, and, notably, it enables a smaller GPT-2 Medium model to solve 5x5 multiplication with high accuracy. The analysis of different components and ablation studies (e.g., the importance of the mixture approach and coupling/optimization) further strengthens the empirical validation.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is well-written, clearly structured, and easy to follow. The introduction effectively motivates the research, and the related work section provides a comprehensive overview of the relevant literature. The appendices offer sufficient detail about data augmentation and model parameters.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Performance Gap Compared to Explicit CoT:** While the ICoT approach outperforms direct prediction, it currently lags significantly behind explicit CoT in terms of accuracy. The authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest possible reasons (e.g., pretraining bias towards horizontal reasoning, insufficient model layers). This performance gap needs to be addressed in future work to make ICoT a more competitive alternative to explicit CoT.
*   **Lack of Interpretability:** As the authors concede, ICoT sacrifices the transparency of explicit CoT. The reasoning process is hidden within the internal states, making it difficult to understand how the model arrives at its conclusions. While efficiency is gained, the lack of interpretability is a significant drawback, particularly for applications where understanding the reasoning process is crucial.
*   **Reliance on Teacher's Thought Process:** The current approach relies heavily on the teacher model's CoT for guiding the student model. While the "Couple and Optimize" step allows for some deviation from the teacher, the initial stages are strongly influenced by the teacher's reasoning strategy. It would be valuable to explore methods that allow the student model to develop its own, potentially more efficient, reasoning pathways from the outset.
*   **Limited Discussion of "Gradient Subspaces":** The paper doesn't delve into the analysis of "gradient subspaces" that are optimized during the training, which could provide further insights into the learned implicit reasoning strategies. Exploring these subspaces might offer a way to characterize the differences between ICoT and explicit CoT in terms of how the model represents knowledge and computation.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Investigate Techniques to Bridge the Performance Gap:** Future work should focus on improving the accuracy of ICoT to make it more competitive with explicit CoT. This could involve exploring different training techniques, architectures, or pretraining strategies that are more conducive to implicit reasoning.
*   **Explore Methods for Enhancing Interpretability:** While inherent transparency may be impossible, research efforts could be directed toward developing methods for gaining some insight into the ICoT reasoning process. This might involve techniques for visualizing or probing the hidden states to understand how they represent intermediate computations.
*   **Reduce Reliance on Teacher's Thought Process:** Investigate approaches that allow the student model to develop its own reasoning strategies from the beginning, rather than relying so heavily on the teacher's CoT. This could involve using different loss functions, architectures, or training regimes.
*   **Analyze the computational properties inherent to Implicit CoT:** As mentioned in point four of the 'Suggestions for Improvement', a discussion on the impact of optimizing "gradient subspaces" that arise during the training process for this ICoT model would provide further insights into the learned implicit reasoning strategies.

**Overall:**

This is a promising paper that introduces a novel and interesting approach to reasoning in LLMs. While ICoT currently has limitations in terms of performance and interpretability, the core idea is compelling, and the empirical results demonstrate its potential. With further research and development, ICoT could become a valuable alternative to explicit CoT, offering a more efficient and potentially more powerful way for LLMs to reason. I recommend acceptance of this paper.
