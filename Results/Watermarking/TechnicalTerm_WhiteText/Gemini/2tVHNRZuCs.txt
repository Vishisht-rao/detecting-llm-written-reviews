## Review of "Enabling Language Models to Implicitly Learn Self-Improvement"

This paper presents ImPlicit Self-ImprovemenT (PIT), a novel framework that aims to enable large language models (LLMs) to self-improve without relying on explicitly defined rubrics, which are often difficult and expensive to create. The core idea is to reformulate the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) training objective to focus on maximizing the *quality gap* between an improved response and a reference response, rather than simply maximizing response quality in isolation. This implicitly encodes the improvement goal within the reward model training process, leveraging existing preference data without requiring additional human effort.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The PIT framework offers a compelling alternative to prompting-based self-improvement methods. The implicit learning of improvement goals from preference data is a significant contribution, addressing the limitations of manually designing comprehensive rubrics.
*   **Sound Methodology:** The paper provides a clear and well-defined methodology, outlining the reformulation of RLHF steps (SFT, reward model training, RL) for the PIT framework. The use of curriculum reinforcement learning is a particularly insightful approach to gradually guide the model towards improving high-quality responses. The equations are well-defined and explained.
*   **Comprehensive Experiments:** The paper presents a thorough experimental evaluation using diverse datasets, including real-world and synthetic data. The comparison with a prompting-based method (Self-Refine) provides a strong baseline for demonstrating the effectiveness of PIT.  The ablation studies on curriculum RL and the exploration of different temperature settings are valuable additions. The inclusion of both automatic and human evaluations strengthens the validity of the results.
*   **Clear Writing:** The paper is well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the proposed method and the experimental setup. The figures and tables are informative and contribute to the clarity of the presentation. The appendix contains helpful details for reproducibility.
*   **Addresses a real problem:** The reliance on human-defined rubrics for self-improvement is a known bottleneck.  PIT tackles this head-on.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Ablation on Reward Model Loss:** While the paper mentions exploring other reward model training objectives, a more detailed ablation study on different formulations of the reward gap loss (beyond what's in the appendix) would be beneficial. While the explanation is provided, further experimentation would strengthen the justification for Equation 2.
*   **Dependence on RLHF:** While the paper acknowledges alternative alignment methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), the reliance on the more complex and potentially unstable RLHF framework could be a limitation. It would be valuable to discuss how PIT could be adapted to work with simpler alignment techniques.
*   **Limited discussion on limitations beyond the Appendix:** While a detailed limitations section is in the Appendix, it would be useful to highlight key limitations and future directions (e.g. domain transfer) within the main paper.

**Minor Comments:**

*   The paper mentions a number of times that is is not clear to humans how to construct a comprehensive set of rules. But "in order to analyze responses, it may be necessary to use signals in the “frequency domain” for which explicit rules are difficult to express."
*   It would be helpful to explicitly state the training time/cost for the PIT model, particularly in comparison to training a standard LLM or fine-tuning with explicit rubrics (if data is available).
*   The justification for using temperature = 0.4 and 0.8 for PIT and Self-Refine, respectively, on the Anthropic/HH-RLHF dataset could be strengthened.  Why are these values optimal, and what is the intuition behind the difference?
*   In Table 3, it seems counter-intuitive that more iterations don't necessarily lead to better ELO scores.  The paper acknowledges this, but a more in-depth analysis of *why* this occurs would be valuable (even if speculative).

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach to self-improvement in LLMs. The PIT framework addresses a key limitation of existing methods by implicitly learning improvement goals from preference data. The comprehensive experimental evaluation and clear writing make this paper a valuable contribution to the field.  I recommend acceptance.
