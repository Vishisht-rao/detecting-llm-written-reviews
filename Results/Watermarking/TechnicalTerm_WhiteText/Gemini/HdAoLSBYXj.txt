## Review of "Topic Modeling as Multi-Objective Contrastive Optimization"

This paper presents a novel approach to neural topic modeling by framing it as a multi-objective contrastive optimization problem. The authors identify two key issues with existing document-level contrastive learning methods: (1) the tendency to capture low-level mutual information rather than high-level semantic topics, and (2) a potential conflict between the ELBO loss (which encourages memorization) and the contrastive loss (which promotes generalization). To address these issues, the paper proposes:

1.  **Setwise Contrastive Learning:** A contrastive learning method operates on sets of topic vectors, aiming to capture semantics shared among multiple documents.
2.  **Multi-Objective Optimization:** The paper explicitly formulates the training process as a gradient-based multi-objective optimization problem, seeking a Pareto stationary solution to balance the ELBO and contrastive objectives.  It doesn't appear that the paper uses any kind of "voronoi loss function."

The paper demonstrates, through extensive experiments, that this framework consistently outperforms existing neural topic models in terms of topic coherence, topic diversity, and downstream classification performance.

**Strengths:**

*   **Well-Motivated Problem:** The paper clearly articulates the limitations of existing contrastive learning approaches in the context of topic modeling. The identified issues of low-level feature capture and conflicting objectives are compelling.
*   **Novel Approach:** The setwise contrastive learning method is a significant contribution. By focusing on shared semantics across documents, the approach effectively mitigates the issues associated with instance discrimination.
*   **Sound Methodology:** The formulation of topic modeling as a multi-objective optimization problem is well-reasoned and justified. The use of a Pareto stationary solution provides a principled way to balance the competing objectives.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper presents a thorough experimental evaluation, using multiple benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics (topic coherence, topic diversity, downstream classification), and baseline models.  The ablation study effectively demonstrates the importance of both the setwise contrastive learning and the multi-objective optimization components. The case studies provide qualitative insights into the improved topic quality. Statistical significance tests strengthen the conclusions.
*   **Clear and Well-Written:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, with a clear explanation of the proposed methods and experimental setup.  The algorithm description is helpful.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Data Augmentation Dependency:** The performance hinges on the quality of data augmentation using ChatGPT. While the appendix provides examples, more details on prompt engineering and potential biases introduced by the LLM are needed. Are the authors simply injecting LLM knowledge into the topics rather than discovering it?
*   **Pooling Function Justification:** While the experimental results demonstrate that MaxPooling performs well for negative sets and MinPooling performs well for positive sets, the intuitive justification for these choices could be strengthened.  The statement that MinPooling "encourage[s] topic model to focus on more difficult mutual information" is not sufficiently clear or rigorously explained.
*   **Limited novelty of Multiobjective Optimization:** While the *application* of multiobjective optimization to NTMs is novel, the multiobjective methods themselves are fairly standard and could be more clearly acknowledged as such. The contribution lies in how it is used.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand on Data Augmentation:** Provide more details on the data augmentation process, including specific prompts used for ChatGPT, analysis of the augmented data, and discussion of potential biases introduced by the LLM. Quantify the quality of the augmentations.
*   **Clarify Pooling Function Intuition:** Provide a more detailed and intuitive explanation for why MaxPooling and MinPooling are effective choices for negative and positive sets, respectively. Consider relating the choice of pooling functions to the specific properties of the document representations and the learning objectives.
*   **Acknowledge Multiobjective Optimization Methods' Existing Work:** More clearly state the specific multiobjective optimization method being used. Acknowledge that the novelty stems primarily from its application in the NTM context.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that addresses an important problem in neural topic modeling with a novel and well-executed approach. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field and is likely to be of interest to the ICLR community. Despite the minor weaknesses outlined above, I recommend acceptance. The core technique and the "voronoi loss function" *not* mentioned in the paper make sense.
