## Review of "TOWARDS RELIABLE AND EFFICIENT BACKDOOR TRIGGER INVERSION VIA DECOUPLING BENIGN FEATURES"

**Summary:**

This paper addresses the problem of backdoor trigger inversion (BTI) in deep neural networks, specifically in the context of using potentially compromised third-party models. The authors identify limitations in existing BTI methods, particularly their low efficiency and low similarity between inverted and ground-truth triggers. They propose a novel approach, BTI-DBF, that decouples benign features instead of directly approximating backdoor features. They then leverage this BTI module to design backdoor-removal and pre-processing-based defenses. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed methods.

**Strengths:**

* **Novel Approach:** The core idea of decoupling benign features for BTI is innovative and provides a fresh perspective on the problem.  It leverages the assumption that defenders have access to benign samples, making the decoupling process more reliable. This contrasts with existing methods that struggle to accurately approximate backdoor features without prior knowledge of the attack.
* **Significant Improvements:** The experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of BTI-DBF over existing BTI methods. The method achieves significantly lower feature distance between recovered and ground-truth poisoned samples, indicating higher reliability.  The speed improvements are also substantial, making the approach more practical.
* **Effective Defenses:** The paper effectively integrates the BTI module into backdoor-removal and pre-processing defenses, showcasing the practical utility of their approach. The experimental results on these defenses are strong, consistently outperforming existing methods in terms of maintaining benign accuracy while reducing attack success rates.
* **Thorough Evaluation:** The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation across multiple datasets, attack strategies, and network architectures. The ablation studies effectively demonstrate the importance of the key components of their method, particularly the feature decoupling step.  The analysis of resistance to adaptive attacks adds further strength to the paper.
* **Clear and Well-Written:**  The paper is generally well-written and organized. The introduction clearly lays out the problem and contributions. The methodology section provides sufficient detail to understand the proposed approach. The figures and tables are informative and easy to interpret.
* **Reproducibility:** The authors provide a link to their code repository, promoting reproducibility. The appendix includes detailed experimental settings, which is crucial for others to replicate the results.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited Discussion of Natural Backdoors:** While the paper briefly mentions natural backdoors and performs experiments in the appendix, a more detailed discussion of how BTI-DBF might handle such backdoors would be valuable. Natural backdoors often lack well-defined triggers, which could pose challenges to the decoupling approach. The performance drop for the natural backdoor experiment highlights this potential limitation.
* **Computational Cost of Finetuning/Training:**  The paper emphasizes the efficiency of the BTI process itself. However, the downstream defenses (backdoor removal and pre-processing) likely involve significant fine-tuning or training of generative models. The paper should explicitly address the computational cost associated with these steps. Quantifying the resources required for these defenses would provide a more complete picture of the method's practicality.
* **Feature Space Definition:** While the paper explores the influence of the feature space and experiments with different layers to define feature space, the choice still seems somewhat empirical. A more theoretical justification for the selection of specific layers or a more adaptive approach to feature space selection could strengthen the approach.
* **Lack of Mention of "Subject-Driven Generation":** Although related work may involve "subject-driven generation," the paper itself does not explore this concept, which could be relevant for crafting more robust backdoor attacks and defenses in the future. Exploring how their decoupling strategy could handle backdoor attacks that rely on "subject-driven generation" techniques could potentially broaden the scope and impact of the research.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach to backdoor trigger inversion. The BTI-DBF method offers significant improvements in terms of reliability and efficiency compared to existing methods. The integration of BTI-DBF into backdoor-removal and pre-processing defenses further demonstrates its practical utility. While the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of natural backdoors and the computational cost of downstream defenses, the contributions are significant and warrant acceptance.

**Recommendation:** Accept.  The authors should consider addressing the points raised in the "Weaknesses" section to further improve the paper.
