## Review of "Progressive Fourier Neural Representation for Sequential Video Compilation"

This paper presents a novel method, Progressive Fourier Neural Representation (PFNR), for continual learning of neural implicit representations (NIRs) for video data. The core idea is to find an adaptive and compact sub-module in Fourier space to encode each video in a sequential training setting. By freezing the weights of previously learned subnetworks, the method aims to overcome catastrophic forgetting and enable the accumulation of high-quality neural representations for multiple videos. The paper demonstrates impressive performance gains over strong continual learning baselines on UVG8/17 and DAVIS50 datasets. The code is also publicly available.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The idea of using a Fourier subnetwork operator (FSO) within an NIR framework for continual video learning is novel and potentially impactful. Leveraging the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis in the Fourier domain provides an interesting approach to identifying efficient and adaptable subnetworks.
*   **Addressing an Important Problem:** Continual learning of NIRs is a challenging and relevant problem, particularly for resource-constrained environments or privacy-preserving scenarios. The paper effectively highlights the limitations of existing NIR methods in adapting to new data sequentially.
*   **Forget-Free Performance:** The paper convincingly demonstrates the ability of PFNR to achieve "forget-free" performance, ensuring that the quality of previously encoded videos is maintained without degradation. This is a significant achievement compared to existing continual learning methods that often suffer from catastrophic forgetting. The transfer matrix visualization strongly supports this claim.
*   **Experimental Results:** The experimental results on UVG8/17 and DAVIS50 are compelling, showcasing significant performance gains over strong baselines in terms of PSNR and MS-SSIM. The compression analysis further highlights the efficiency of PFNR.
*   **Clear Presentation (mostly):** The paper is generally well-written and explains the proposed method and its motivations clearly. The figures are helpful in understanding the architecture and the concept of PFNR.
*   **Code Availability:** The availability of the code is a significant strength, enabling reproducibility and further research.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Lack of "Perceptual Distance" Metric:** While PSNR and MS-SSIM are commonly used metrics, they don't always correlate well with human perception of video quality. The paper would be significantly stronger if it included a metric that captures "perceptual distance" between the original and reconstructed videos, such as LPIPS or a similar metric. Including this would offer more insights into the visual quality of the generated videos.
*   **Clarity on Implementation Details:** While the overall architecture is explained, some of the finer implementation details, particularly regarding the FSO and the parametric score function, could be clarified further. For example, a more detailed explanation of how the "top-percentage weights" are selected based on their ranking scores would be beneficial.
*   **Computational Cost:** Although PFNR avoids replaying data or adding significant capacity, Table 14 shows the increased computational time to train f-NeRV2. The paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the computational trade-offs between training and inference, and potential optimizations to reduce training cost. How does the memory footprint of PFNR compare to other methods (especially rehearsal-based approaches)?
*   **Scale Limitation Discussion:** The performance on the DAVIS50 dataset, while consistent with the UVG results, is significantly lower than on the smaller datasets. The paper acknowledges this but could discuss potential reasons for this performance degradation at larger scales more deeply. Are there specific challenges related to video diversity or complexity in DAVIS50 that are not adequately addressed by the current PFNR architecture?
*   **Limited Ablation Studies:** While the added supplementary material provides some additional ablation studies, more analysis on the impact of the specific components of the FSO and the score function would be valuable.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Include a Perceptual Metric:** Add a "perceptual distance" metric like LPIPS to the experimental results to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of video quality.
*   **Clarify Implementation Details:** Provide more details on the FSO and score function implementation, perhaps with pseudo-code or more specific mathematical formulations.
*   **Analyze Computational Cost:** Discuss the computational costs of PFNR in more detail, comparing them to those of other continual learning methods, especially rehearsal-based ones. Explore potential optimizations to reduce training time.
*   **Address Scalability Limitations:** Discuss the potential reasons for the lower performance on the DAVIS50 dataset and suggest future research directions to improve scalability.
*   **Strengthen Ablation Studies:** Include additional ablation studies to analyze the impact of specific FSO components and the score function.
*   **More Qualitative Results:** While quantitative results are strong, including more qualitative results (e.g., side-by-side comparisons of reconstructed videos from PFNR and baselines) would further strengthen the paper's claims.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper presenting a novel and promising approach to continual learning of neural implicit representations for video data. The experimental results are compelling and the code is publicly available. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further enhance the paper's impact and solidify its contribution to the field.
