## Review of "MM-LDM: Multi-Modal Latent Diffusion Model for Sounding Video Generation"

This paper introduces MM-LDM, a novel multi-modal latent diffusion model for the challenging task of sounding video generation (SVG). The paper tackles the computational burden of previous signal-space diffusion approaches by operating in a lower-dimensional, perceptually equivalent latent space for both audio and video. The authors propose a two-stage approach: a multi-modal autoencoder that compresses audio and video signals into this latent space, followed by a transformer-based diffusion model that generates the audio and video within the latent space. Key innovations include unifying audio and video representations, constructing a shared high-level semantic feature space, and utilizing cross-modal sampling guidance for conditional generation tasks like audio-to-video and video-to-audio. The experimental results demonstrate significant quality and efficiency gains, achieving state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The paper addresses a critical limitation in existing SVG methods ‚Äì the computational cost of operating in the raw signal space. The proposed MM-LDM effectively mitigates this by leveraging a latent diffusion approach, leading to substantial improvements in training and sampling speed. The shared semantic feature space and cross-modal sampling guidance are also novel contributions that enhance cross-modal consistency and enable conditional generation.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The methodology is well-described and technically sound. The architecture of the multi-modal autoencoder, including the shared decoder and projector functions, is clearly explained. The use of a Transformer-based diffusion model (DiT) in the latent space is appropriate given the reduced dimensionality. The mathematical formulations for the diffusion process, loss functions, and conditional generation are clearly presented.
*   **Experimental Evaluation:** The paper provides a comprehensive experimental evaluation, including quantitative comparisons against strong baseline models on two challenging datasets (Landscape and AIST++). The results demonstrate significant improvements in FVD, KVD, and FAD metrics. The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the contribution of each component of the proposed method. The qualitative results showcase the improved visual fidelity and audio-video alignment compared to existing methods. The efficiency gains are particularly impressive, with a 10x faster sampling speed reported.
*   **Clarity and Organization:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The introduction clearly motivates the problem and highlights the contributions. The method section provides a detailed explanation of the proposed approach. The experimental setup and results are clearly presented. The figures are helpful in visualizing the architecture and results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Discriminator Detail:** The paper mentions an adversarial loss and a discriminator composed of spatiotemporal modules with residual blocks and cross-modal full attentions, but the precise architecture is not provided in the text or the appendix. More details here would significantly strengthen the paper.
*   **Lack of discussion around "tractable inference":** While the paper does an excellent job presenting the contributions in terms of speed and efficiency, the authors do not explicitly frame the work in the context of providing "tractable inference." This would be beneficial.
*   **Clarity on the relationship between latent variables:** More clarity could be given on how the audio and video latent variables are related to each other after the encoding process but before the diffusion process. Is there a correlation learned during the encoding process before the diffusion?
*   **Minor Clarity Issue:** Figure 2 could be improved by showing more explicitly how the "Video Encoder" and "Audio Encoder" contribute to the "shared ùëßùëé0 ùëßùë£0". The current figure obscures the path.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Provide more details on the discriminator architecture in both the main paper or the appendix.**
*   Explicitly highlight the "tractable inference" capabilities as one of the main contributions of the paper.
*   Provide a more detailed explanation of the information sharing or correlation that is learned between the video and audio latent variables *before* the diffusion model is applied.
*   Improve Figure 2 for better clarity of the contribution of video and audio encoders.
*   Consider adding an analysis of failure cases or limitations of the proposed method. This would provide a more complete picture of the performance and potential areas for future research.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach for sounding video generation. The proposed MM-LDM achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant efficiency gains. The paper is well-written and the methodology is technically sound. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive and the results are convincing. Despite the minor weaknesses, this paper is a valuable contribution to the field of multi-modal generation and is suitable for publication at ICLR 2024.
