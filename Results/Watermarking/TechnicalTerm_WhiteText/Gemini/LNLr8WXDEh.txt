## Review of "WHAT DOES STABLE DIFFUSION KNOW ABOUT THE 3D SCENE?"

This paper presents an interesting and well-motivated investigation into the 3D scene understanding capabilities of Stable Diffusion, a state-of-the-art image generation model. The core idea of probing the internal representations of the diffusion network to assess its understanding of various physical properties of the scene is novel and promising. The authors propose a clear evaluation protocol and apply it rigorously to a range of properties, including geometry, material, support relations, lighting, and view-dependent measures. The finding that Stable Diffusion exhibits strong performance on geometry, support relations, shadows, and depth, while struggling with occlusion and material, is a valuable contribution to the field. The comparison with other large-scale pre-trained models like DINO and CLIP further strengthens the paper's findings and highlights the potential of using Stable Diffusion features for downstream tasks.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The research question is highly relevant given the rapid advancements in generative models. Understanding the extent to which these models implicitly learn 3D scene properties is crucial for future development and applications.
*   **Clear Methodology:** The proposed evaluation protocol is well-defined and easy to understand. The three-step process involving dataset selection, feature selection via grid search, and evaluation with a linear classifier provides a systematic way to probe the network's representations.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper covers a diverse set of 3D scene properties, providing a holistic view of Stable Diffusion's understanding.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The experimental results are clearly presented and support the authors' claims. The comparisons with other pre-trained models provide valuable context and demonstrate the superiority of Stable Diffusion features for certain tasks.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the authors' reasoning and methodology.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Region Representation:** The method for obtaining region representations using simple average pooling may be too simplistic. More sophisticated techniques could potentially improve the performance of the probes, especially for properties like material and occlusion, where local details might be important. This also touches on "equivariant operations."
*   **Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Questions:** The authors acknowledge that some symmetric questions could be reformulated in a non-symmetric manner. While they provide a reason for the current formulation, exploring the non-symmetric versions could reveal additional insights into the network's understanding.
*   **Limited Analysis of Failure Cases:** While the paper mentions the challenges with material and occlusion, a more detailed analysis of the failure cases, including visual examples, could provide a deeper understanding of the limitations of Stable Diffusion's representation.
*   **Lack of Connection to Established Literature:** The paper does a good job of reviewing relevant literature on generative models and probing techniques. However, there is a missed opportunity to discuss connections to areas like "equivariant neural networks" that specifically deal with building models that respect symmetries in the data and could be more effective than linear probes. "Tensor product" representations for materials and surfaces could also be explored. The authors could also mention "change of basis" of the latent space using a "fourier basis" or even a more complex "spherical harmonics" basis to investigate if the latent space is better organized for some downstream tasks in a different coordinate system.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   Explore more sophisticated region representation techniques beyond average pooling.
*   Investigate non-symmetric formulations of the probe questions.
*   Provide a more detailed analysis of the failure cases, including visual examples and potential explanations.
*   Discuss potential connections to related research areas, such as equivariant neural networks and other feature representation techniques that might be relevant for modeling 3D scene properties.
*   Consider exploring the use of learned probing functions (beyond a linear SVM) to extract more nuanced representations.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and well-executed investigation into the 3D scene understanding capabilities of Stable Diffusion. The findings are significant and contribute to our understanding of these powerful generative models. Addressing the minor weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper. I recommend acceptance.
