## Review of "PCLAST: DISCOVERING PLANNABLE CONTINUOUS LATENT STATES"

This paper proposes a novel approach, PCLAST, for learning latent state representations suitable for goal-conditioned planning. The key idea is to learn a representation that associates reachable states together, aiming to improve sample efficiency and enable hierarchical planning. The method involves first learning a latent representation using multi-step inverse dynamics to remove distracting information, and then transforming this representation to embed reachable states closer together in â„“2 space via a contrastive objective. The paper presents promising results across several simulated environments, demonstrating improvements in sample efficiency for both reward-based and reward-free settings.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Problem Definition and Motivation:** The paper clearly articulates the limitations of existing latent representations in capturing state affordances and reachability, which hinders their planning capabilities. The motivation for learning a "plannable" latent space is well-established and resonates with the challenges in real-world robotic tasks.
*   **Novel Approach:** The proposed PCLAST method is novel and combines inverse dynamics with a temporal contrastive objective in a meaningful way. The intuition behind using a Gaussian random walk to encourage reachability in the latent space is sound.
*   **Rigorous Experiments:** The paper presents a comprehensive set of experiments across diverse environments, including Maze2D, Robotic-Arm, and Mujoco tasks with exogenous noise. The experiments evaluate the impact of PCLAST on goal-conditioned RL, state abstraction, and hierarchical planning.
*   **Demonstrated Improvements:** The results demonstrate significant improvements in sample efficiency and planning performance when using PCLAST compared to baseline methods like ACRO, especially in maze environments. The hierarchical planning experiments show promising speedups in plan computation.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the proposed method and experimental results. The inclusion of visualizations, such as the clustering of latent states and the abstract transition models, helps to illustrate the benefits of PCLAST.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Discussion of Limitations:** While the paper shows improvements, it lacks a deeper discussion of the limitations of PCLAST. For example, the reliance on a Gaussian random walk might be insufficient for environments with highly non-Markovian dynamics or complex contact interactions. It would be valuable to explore failure cases and discuss potential areas for improvement.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The paper mentions using a hyperparameter *dm* for sampling positive examples in the contrastive objective.  A discussion on the sensitivity of the method to different values of *dm* and other hyperparameters would be beneficial. Providing guidelines on how to tune these parameters for different environments would improve the reproducibility and usability of the method.
*   **Lack of Comparison to State-of-the-Art Planning Methods:** While the paper compares to relevant representation learning methods, it lacks a direct comparison to more advanced planning algorithms, particularly those designed for handling non-Euclidean latent spaces or complex constraints.  Including such comparisons would provide a more complete picture of the performance of PCLAST in a broader planning context.
*   **Clarity on Multi-Layer Abstraction:** While the concept of multi-layered planning is introduced, the details of how the abstraction levels are determined (specifically the choice of *k* for k-means at each level) could be clarified further. Are these *k* values hand-tuned, or is there an automated strategy for selecting them?
*   **No mention of "out-of-variable generalization":** The paper would benefit from a discussion of whether and how PCLAST improves "out-of-variable generalization", especially given the focus on learning representations robust to exogenous noise. Does PCLAST exhibit better generalization to novel environments or scenarios not seen during training compared to baseline methods?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Discuss Limitations:** Add a section discussing the limitations of PCLAST and potential failure cases.
*   **Hyperparameter Analysis:** Include an analysis of the sensitivity of the method to different hyperparameter settings.
*   **Comparison to Advanced Planning Methods:** Compare PCLAST to more advanced planning algorithms that are designed for complex latent spaces.
*   **Clarify Multi-Layer Abstraction Details:** Provide more details on how the abstraction levels are determined in the multi-layered planner.
*   **Address "out-of-variable generalization":** Discuss whether and how PCLAST improves "out-of-variable generalization."

**Overall:**

This paper presents a solid contribution to the field of representation learning for planning. The proposed PCLAST method is novel and shows promising results in improving sample efficiency and enabling hierarchical planning. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper and make it a more valuable contribution to the ICLR community. I recommend acceptance, conditional on addressing the weaknesses.
