## Review of "MINILLM: Knowledge Distillation of Large Language Models"

This paper presents a novel knowledge distillation (KD) approach, MINILLM, specifically designed for distilling knowledge from large language models (LLMs) into smaller, more computationally efficient models. The authors identify a key limitation of standard KD methods when applied to generative LLMs: the reliance on forward Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD). They argue that minimizing forward KLD in the context of text generation leads to the student model overestimating low-probability regions of the teacher's distribution, resulting in poor generation quality.

To address this, the paper proposes minimizing the reverse KLD between the student and teacher distributions. This approach encourages the student to focus on the major modes of the teacher's distribution, avoiding the pitfalls of trying to replicate all the nuanced details (and potential noise) present in the larger model.  The paper provides a compelling justification for this choice, relating it to both mode-seeking behavior and a connection to Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), providing a stronger theoretical foundation for the proposed approach.

A significant contribution of the paper lies in the derivation and optimization of the reverse KLD objective. The authors leverage the Policy Gradient Theorem to derive a tractable gradient and further introduce several techniques to stabilize and accelerate training: single-step decomposition, teacher-mixed sampling, and length normalization. These strategies address common challenges in reinforcement learning-based training, such as high variance and reward hacking, and demonstrate a practical understanding of the optimization landscape.

The experimental section is comprehensive, covering a wide range of model sizes (120M to 13B parameters) and model families (GPT-2, OPT, LLaMA).  The results consistently demonstrate that MINILLM outperforms standard KD baselines (SFT, word-level KD, sequence-level KD) across various instruction-following datasets. Furthermore, the authors perform detailed analyses to validate the effectiveness of MINILLM, including:

*   **Scaling Law of Teacher:** Showing that MINILLM benefits from larger teacher models.
*   **Exposure Bias:** Demonstrating that MINILLM exhibits lower exposure bias, leading to more robust generalization.
*   **Calibration:** Indicating that MINILLM leads to better calibrated student models, addressing a potential concern with policy optimization methods.
*   **Performance on Various Response Lengths:** Showing the consistent benefits for generating texts longer than 6 tokens.
*   **Generation Diversity:** Showing the model also exhibits good generation diversity.
*   **Ablation Studies:** Thoroughly evaluating the impact of the proposed optimization strategies.

The paper is well-written and clearly explains the technical details of the proposed method. The figures are informative and effectively illustrate the key concepts and results. The inclusion of implementation details, such as hyperparameter settings and training procedures, enhances the reproducibility of the work.  The link to the code, data, and model checkpoints further strengthens the paper's contribution to the community.

**Strengths:**

*   Novel and well-motivated approach to knowledge distillation for LLMs.
*   Sound theoretical justification for using reverse KLD.
*   Effective optimization strategies to address challenges in reinforcement learning-based training.
*   Comprehensive experimental evaluation across various model sizes and datasets.
*   Thorough analysis to validate the effectiveness of MINILLM.
*   Clear writing and presentation.
*   Release of code, data, and model checkpoints.

**Weaknesses:**

*   While the connection to IRL is interesting, it could be explored in more depth.
*   While diversity is analyzed, more quantitative data on a wider array of diversity metrics may be interesting.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a significant advancement in knowledge distillation for LLMs. The proposed MINILLM method offers a practical and effective approach for compressing LLMs while preserving their performance. The paper's thorough experimental evaluation and analysis provide compelling evidence for the benefits of the proposed approach. The authors also include "reinforcement learning; large language models; robotics" in English. I recommend this paper for acceptance.
