## Review of "CURIOSITY -DRIVEN RED-TEAMING FOR LARGE LAN-GUAGE MODELS"

This paper presents a novel approach to automated red-teaming of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging curiosity-driven exploration, drawing a connection between increasing the coverage of generated test cases and well-established methods of optimizing for novelty. The core idea is to augment standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) based red-teaming with an objective that encourages the generation of diverse and novel prompts, addressing a key limitation of existing RL-based methods which tend to converge to a small set of effective, but not representative, test cases.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addressing an Important Problem:** The paper tackles a critical issue in LLM deployment: identifying prompts that elicit undesirable responses. Automated red-teaming is a promising area, and improving coverage of the generated test cases is a significant contribution.
*   **Well-Motivated Approach:** The authors clearly articulate the limitations of current RL-based red-teaming, highlighting the issues of low coverage and the tendency towards deterministic policies. The connection to curiosity-driven exploration is well-argued and justified.
*   **Effective Method:** The proposed method, CRT, shows impressive results in increasing the diversity of generated test cases while maintaining or improving their effectiveness (measured as toxicity) compared to existing baselines. The experiments demonstrate the method's ability to provoke toxic responses even from heavily fine-tuned models like LLaMA2.
*   **Comprehensive Experiments:** The paper presents a thorough evaluation of CRT on two different tasks (text continuation and instruction following) and against various target LLMs, including those fine-tuned with RLHF. The analysis and ablation studies provide valuable insights into the contributions of each reward term. Furthermore the additional experimental results (Appendix C) add weight to the conclusions.
*   **Clear and Well-Written:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, making the technical details accessible to a broad audience. The inclusion of qualitative examples and code availability further enhances the paper's value.
*   **Demonstrates Value:** The ability to elicit toxic responses from LLaMA2, despite its RLHF training, highlights the method's power and the limitations of current safety measures.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The paper acknowledges the sensitivity of novelty reward weights, which could be a barrier to practical application. While they experimented with these parameters, a more adaptive approach to automatically adjusting these weights would be beneficial.
*   **Limited Theoretical Analysis:** While the empirical results are strong, the paper lacks a deeper theoretical analysis of why curiosity-driven exploration is so effective in this context. Exploring connections to concepts like information gain or exploration-exploitation trade-offs could further strengthen the work.
*   **Limited Comparison to Other Diversity Techniques:** While the paper compares to increasing the temperature and adding an entropy bonus, it could benefit from a comparison to other more sophisticated diversity-promoting techniques used in generative models, such as those employing determinantal point processes or adversarial training.
*   **Missing a Discussion of "Graphons":** The paper claims that the coverage of the span of prompts is improved. This leads to the expectation that certain theoretical topics are relevant, such as the analysis of "graphons." It would be valuable to compare the method to other methods that do analyze "graphons."

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Adaptive Reward Weighting:** Investigate methods for automatically tuning or adapting the weights of the novelty rewards during training. EIPO is mentioned as a potential solution. Explore other possibilities as well.
*   **Theoretical Analysis:** Provide a more in-depth theoretical explanation of why curiosity-driven exploration is so effective for red-teaming LLMs. Connecting the method to existing theoretical frameworks could further solidify its contribution.
*   **Broader Comparison:** Include a comparison to other diversity-promoting techniques used in generative models.
*   **Broader impact discussion:** While the ethics statement is present, consider explicitly addressing the potential dual-use nature of the research and how to mitigate potential misuse.
*   **Addressing memory constraints:** This method stores the history of test cases, the memory requirements of which may grow too large when testing for a long time. This should be addressed.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a valuable contribution to the field of automated red-teaming of LLMs. The proposed method, CRT, effectively increases the diversity of generated test cases while maintaining or improving their effectiveness. While some minor improvements can be made, the paper is well-written, well-motivated, and supported by comprehensive experiments. It is a valuable addition to the ICLR community and deserves to be accepted.
