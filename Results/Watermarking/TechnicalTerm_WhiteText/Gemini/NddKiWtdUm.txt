## Review of "TRAINING SOCIALLY ALIGNED LANGUAGE MODELS IN SIMULATED HUMAN SOCIETY"

**Summary:**

This paper presents a novel approach, "Stable Alignment," for training socially aligned language models (LMs). The core idea revolves around simulating social interactions within a controlled environment called SANDBOX, where LM-based agents interact, receive feedback, and revise their responses based on an underlying social incentive. The collected data, consisting of comparative pairs, collective ratings, detailed feedback, and revised responses, is then used to train LMs in a three-stage framework: Imitation, Self-Critic, and Realignment. The authors demonstrate that Stable Alignment outperforms existing alignment methods in several benchmarks, particularly exhibiting enhanced robustness against adversarial "jailbreaking" prompts.

**Strengths:**

* **Novelty and Significance:** The paper proposes a genuinely innovative approach to social alignment by directly simulating social interactions rather than relying solely on human annotation or reward modeling. This addresses limitations of existing methods such as scalability, annotation cost, reward gaming, and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. This approach mimics how humans learn social norms and values.
* **SANDBOX Platform:** The introduction of SANDBOX as an open-source platform is a significant contribution. It provides a versatile environment not only for developing socially aligned LMs but also for studying AI behavioral patterns in a controlled social context.  The Back-Scatter method for simulating social interactions seems well-designed.
* **Stable Alignment Framework:** The three-stage training process (Imitation, Self-Critic, and Realignment) appears well-structured and logically sound.  The ablation studies effectively demonstrate the contributions of each stage, particularly the importance of the Realignment stage for adversarial robustness.
* **Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO):**  The authors introduce and effectively utilize CPO as a new alignment algorithm that directly optimizes the policy towards preferred responses. The dynamic margin adjustment based on rating differences is a clever mechanism.
* **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper presents a thorough evaluation using a range of benchmarks (Anthropic HH, Moral Stories, MIC, ETHICS, TruthfulQA) and both automatic metrics and human evaluations. The comparison against several strong baselines (LLaMA, Alpaca, TRLX, DPO, RRHF) strengthens the results.
* **Scalability and Efficiency:** The authors convincingly argue for the scalability and efficiency of Stable Alignment compared to methods like RLHF, highlighting its suitability for resource-constrained environments.
* **Reproducibility:** The authors emphasize reproducibility by using publicly available datasets and codebases and by providing supplementary materials (data, code, and launching scripts).
* **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is clear, concise, and well-organized, making it easy to follow the proposed approach and understand the experimental results.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Simplified Social Simulation:** The paper acknowledges that SANDBOX, while innovative, presents a simplified view of human social interactions.  The text-based nature and the static view of societal norms are limitations that need further consideration. The inclusion of non-verbal cues and modeling the dynamic evolution of social values would enhance the realism of the simulation.
* **English-Centric Analysis:** The empirical analysis is primarily conducted in English, limiting the generalizability of the findings. While the potential for extension to other languages is mentioned, further research is needed to validate this claim.
* **Lack of exploration of different simulation parameters:** While the paper introduces SANDBOX and its benefits, it could benefit from a more thorough analysis of the impact of various simulation parameters (e.g., number of agents, interaction range, latent rule characteristics) on the resulting LM's alignment. Understanding how these parameters influence the learned social norms would be valuable.
* **Overclaiming generalizability to other modalities and domains:** The paper concludes by stating, "We posit that the concept of learning alignment from simulated human behavior could be readily extended to other domains or modalities." While this is a reasonable hypothesis, the paper lacks any evidence or discussion supporting this claim. The authors should tone down this statement or provide some preliminary thoughts on how the framework could be adapted to other contexts.
* **Limited discussion on "dmlr":** The paper focuses on Stable Alignment as a method for improving alignment, but it could benefit from a more direct discussion of its relationship to "dmlr" approaches (distribution matching language models). While Stable Alignment uses data generated from a simulated society, how does it relate to learning the distribution of aligned responses? Addressing this connection could further contextualize the work within the broader field.

**Minor Comments:**

* Figure 1 could be improved by visually representing the "SANDBOX Rule."
* The phrasing "Transitioning from a 6.8B to a 175B GPT-3 model, despite a 20-fold increase in model size, does not yield significant improvement" is a bit strong. While the improvement might not be *significant* statistically, it's still a positive trend. Perhaps rephrase to "did not result in a substantial improvement."
* In the discussion of limitations, consider adding a comment on the computational cost of the simulation process.

**Overall Recommendation:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and promising approach to training socially aligned language models. The strengths of the paper significantly outweigh its weaknesses. I recommend acceptance. The SANDBOX platform and the Stable Alignment framework have the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of AI safety and alignment. The authors should address the minor weaknesses in their revision.
