## Review of "Pre-Training with Synthetic Data Helps Offline Reinforcement Learning"

This paper investigates the benefits of pre-training for offline Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms, specifically Decision Transformer (DT) and Conservative Q-Learning (CQL). The central hypothesis is that the performance gains observed from language pre-training in DT (Reid et al., 2022) are not unique to language and can be achieved with simpler, non-linguistic pre-training schemes. The paper presents compelling evidence supporting this hypothesis, demonstrating that pre-training with synthetic data (generated from Markov Chains for DT and Markov Decision Processes for CQL) can significantly improve downstream offline RL performance.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Research Question and Motivation:** The paper clearly articulates the research question of whether language is essential for improved performance in offline DRL and provides a strong motivation based on existing literature. It convincingly argues that a deeper understanding of pre-training benefits is needed.
*   **Well-Designed Experiments:** The experiments are well-designed and comprehensive. The paper carefully compares DT and CQL with various synthetic pre-training schemes, including IID data, Markov Chains with varying step sizes and state spaces, and MDPs with different temperature values. It uses standard benchmark datasets (D4RL) and provides detailed hyperparameter settings.
*   **Surprising and Interesting Results:** The key finding that simple synthetic data can outperform language pre-training for DT is surprising and challenges the prevailing belief that language models are essential for offline RL. The consistent performance improvements observed for both DT and CQL, even with IID data, are significant. The result that "ood supervision" via synthetic pre-training can lead to tangible improvements is well-demonstrated.
*   **Extensive Ablation Studies:** The paper includes extensive ablation studies to investigate the impact of different synthetic data properties on downstream performance, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed approach.
*   **Theoretical Insights:** The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the forward dynamics objective, offering insights into why IID data can be surprisingly effective.
*   **Thorough Comparison and Discussion:** The paper offers thorough comparisons against other pre-training methods, including those based on language and image data. The discussion of computational efficiency, especially compared to Wiki pre-training, is valuable.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is well-written, clearly organized, and easy to follow. The introduction provides a good overview of the problem and contributions. The related work section is comprehensive and situates the paper within the relevant literature.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Intuition:** While the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of synthetic pre-training, it could benefit from a deeper intuitive explanation of *why* this approach works.  The theoretical analysis provides some insight, but a more thorough discussion of the mechanisms underlying the performance gains would strengthen the paper. The hypothesis that "pre-training might have helped make the optimization process smoother during fine-tuning" is mentioned but could be further explored.
*   **Scalability Concerns:** The paper focuses on relatively simple tasks and environments. It's unclear how well the proposed approach would scale to more complex, high-dimensional RL problems.  Addressing this concern would improve the generalizability of the findings.
*   **Synthetic Data Generation:** While the method used to generate the synthetic data is simple and effective, it is very random and unaligned with the downstream task. It would be interesting to see whether pre-training data that is a more structured or aligned with the downstream RL task would lead to even larger gains.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand the discussion on the potential mechanisms underlying the performance gains from synthetic pre-training.** Explore hypotheses such as smoother optimization landscapes, improved feature initialization, or regularization effects.
*   **Discuss the limitations of the proposed approach and potential challenges in scaling it to more complex RL problems.**
*   **Consider experimenting with synthetic data that is more structured or aligned with the downstream RL task.** This could involve incorporating domain knowledge or using generative models to create more realistic synthetic data.
*   **Consider additional comparisons against related approaches,** especially representation learning methods that aim to learn useful features from unsupervised data.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of offline DRL. The findings are novel, surprising, and potentially impactful. The paper is well-written, well-designed, and supported by extensive experimental results. Despite some minor weaknesses, I recommend accepting this paper for presentation at ICLR 2024. The insights provided by this research are valuable and will likely stimulate further investigation into the benefits of synthetic pre-training for DRL.
