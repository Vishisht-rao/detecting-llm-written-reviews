## Review of "mBLIP: EFFICIENT BOOTSTRAPPING OF MULTILINGUAL VISION-LLMS"

This paper presents mBLIP, a novel and efficient approach to creating multilingual Vision-LLMs. The key idea is to leverage existing English-centric Vision-LLMs and multilingual LLMs through a re-alignment process, avoiding the computationally expensive end-to-end training from scratch. The authors achieve this by re-aligning the image encoder of BLIP-2 to a multilingual LLM using machine-translated English data, coupled with parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. The results are compelling, showing competitive performance on the IGLUE benchmark and even outperforming much larger models like PaLI-X in zero-shot image captioning on XM3600. The paper is well-written, clearly explaining the methodology and providing thorough experimental results.

**Strengths:**

*   **Efficiency:** The primary strength of this work is its computational efficiency. By leveraging pre-trained models and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, mBLIP can be trained on consumer hardware using a relatively small dataset. This addresses a significant barrier to entry for researchers and practitioners interested in multilingual Vision-LLMs.
*   **Novelty:** The idea of re-aligning an image encoder to a multilingual LLM using machine-translated data is a novel approach to building multilingual Vision-LLMs. This approach is particularly appealing given the scarcity of natively multilingual image-text data.
*   **Strong Results:** The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of mBLIP. The model achieves competitive performance on several multilingual vision-language tasks, even outperforming much larger models in some cases.
*   **Thorough Evaluation:** The authors provide a comprehensive evaluation of mBLIP, including comparisons to state-of-the-art models, ablation studies, and a qualitative analysis of the model's capabilities.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors emphasize reproducibility by releasing their code, trained model, and training data. They also provide detailed information about their training and evaluation setup.
*   **Addressing Multilingual Challenges:** The paper tackles a crucial problem in the vision-language space: the dominance of English and the difficulty in creating high-quality multilingual models. mBLIP offers a promising path towards democratizing access to multilingual vision-language technology.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Dependence on Machine Translation:** The reliance on machine translation introduces potential noise and biases into the training data. While the authors use a strong MT model and attempt to mitigate errors through back-translation, the quality of the translated data may still be a limiting factor, especially for lower-resource languages. Further investigation into the impact of MT quality on mBLIP's performance would be beneficial.
*   **Hallucination Mitigation:** While the authors introduce a matching task to reduce object hallucinations, the CHAIR metric shows only slight improvements. More effective strategies to address this common problem in Vision-LLMs, such as incorporating "grounding" techniques, could be explored.
*   **Limited Discussion of "Unsupervised Domain Generalization":** It would be beneficial for the authors to discuss how their approach relates to or benefits from the concept of "unsupervised domain generalization". While the model demonstrates cross-lingual transfer, exploring its ability to generalize to unseen visual domains would strengthen the analysis.
*   **Instruction Following nuances**: The authors should analyze what causes mBLIP to sometimes still generate answers in English despite being instructed in other languages.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Analyze MT quality:** A more in-depth analysis of the impact of machine translation quality on mBLIP's performance, perhaps through correlation analysis between BLEU scores and task accuracy across languages, would be valuable.
*   **Explore alternative hallucination mitigation techniques:** Investigate and compare alternative methods for reducing object hallucinations, such as incorporating knowledge graphs or contrastive learning objectives.
*   **Analyze the effect of different language LLM**: Compare mBLIP using other more recent Multilingual LLMs with higher performance.
*   **Address the negative results:** Analyze the reasons behind poorer performance in the Azerbaijani and Romanian results in the qualitative analysis.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of multilingual Vision-LLMs. The proposed mBLIP approach is efficient, novel, and delivers impressive results. While there are some weaknesses related to the reliance on machine translation and hallucination mitigation, the strengths of this work outweigh the limitations. I recommend this paper for acceptance at ICLR 2024.
