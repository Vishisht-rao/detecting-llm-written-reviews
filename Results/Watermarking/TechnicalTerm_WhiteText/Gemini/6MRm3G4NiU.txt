## Review: SaProt: Protein Language Modeling with Structure-Aware Vocabulary

This paper introduces SaProt, a protein language model (PLM) trained with a novel "structure-aware vocabulary" that combines residue tokens with structural tokens derived from Foldseek. The authors present a compelling argument for incorporating structural information into PLMs to improve performance on various downstream tasks. The paper is well-written, clearly explains the methodology, and provides extensive experimental results. The consistent improvement of SaProt over strong baselines, particularly within the ESM family, is a significant contribution to the field. The ablation studies and analyses provide valuable insights into the impact of structural information and potential pitfalls when training with predicted structures. Overall, this is a strong submission with significant potential impact.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The "structure-aware vocabulary" is an innovative approach to integrating structural information into sequence-based PLMs. The SA-token concept allows for seamless integration with existing PLM architectures and offers a promising direction for future research.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper presents a thorough evaluation of SaProt across 10 diverse downstream tasks, demonstrating its broad applicability and strong performance. The comparison against well-established baselines, including ESM models, provides convincing evidence of SaProt's effectiveness.
*   **Insightful Analysis:** The ablation studies and analyses, particularly the investigation of overfitting issues with predicted structures and the impact of PDB versus AlphaFoldDB structures, offer valuable insights for the community. The visualization of protein representations further strengthens the analysis.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors have made their code, pretrained model, and datasets publicly available, promoting reproducibility and future research.

**Weaknesses and Suggestions:**

*   **Foldseek Dependence:** While the use of Foldseek is practical, it introduces a dependency on its encoding accuracy. The paper mentions this as a limitation, but further discussion on potential alternative structure encoding methods or strategies to mitigate the impact of Foldseek's errors would be beneficial. Could the vocabulary be improved by incorporating some measure of confidence in the Foldseek tokens?
*   **Lack of Fine-grained Error Analysis:** While the overall performance is impressive, a more fine-grained error analysis could reveal specific areas where SaProt excels or struggles. For instance, are there particular protein families or structural motifs where SaProt shows significant improvement over ESM models? Knowing where SaProt has the biggest impact is important.
*   **Discussion of limitations:** A stronger discussion of limitations is encouraged. This could include more details about how parameters such as pLDDT score cutoff impact performance. How is SaProt's performance affected by the resolution of structures in the PDB training set (for SaProt-PDB)? How does the choice of Foldseek impact domain-specific tasks?
*   **"Domain Feedback":** The paper could benefit from a clearer discussion of how "domain feedback" is handled during the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. Does the model incorporate any explicit mechanisms to prevent overfitting to specific structural biases present in the training data? Does the domain data used for tasks in section 4.2 have similar statistical properties (sequence length, proportion of residues in lower pLDDT regions) as the pre-training data? Does the "structure-aware vocabulary" bias SaProt towards tasks and proteins where Foldseek already performs well?

**Specific Comments:**

*   The acknowledgement of Sergey Ovchinnikov's contributions is unusual. While helpful feedback is appreciated, if Sergey's contributions were that significant, he should have been offered co-authorship before submission. This section should be revised to more appropriately reflect his assistance.
*   Figure 2 is difficult to interpret without a clear explanation of the training objective and data used. Consider adding more detail to the caption.
*   Table 4: The sentence: "Note that some protein structures in PDB are not stored in AlphaFoldDB, so the column-level (AlphaFoldDB vs. PDB) comparison in Table 4 does not make much sense." is not quite true. The comparison should be performed on the same set of proteins, restricted to the set of proteins contained in both AlphaFoldDB and PDB.

**Overall:**

SaProt represents a significant advancement in protein language modeling. The novel "structure-aware vocabulary" provides a simple yet effective way to incorporate structural information, leading to improved performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. The paper is well-written, thoroughly evaluated, and provides valuable insights for the community. With minor revisions addressing the weaknesses mentioned above, this paper is suitable for publication.
