## Review of "LEARNING BOOLEAN FUNCTIONS WITH NEURAL NETWORKS"

This paper presents theoretical guarantees for learning Boolean functions using two-layer neural networks with ReLU-like activations via gradient descent. The authors focus on the mean squared and hinge losses, specifically targeting the learning of parities and sparse ReLU networks on the Boolean hypercube. A key contribution is their claim to avoid convexity arguments in the analysis, leading to improved iteration complexity bounds compared to prior work.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty in Approach:** The paper's primary strength lies in its attempt to provide gradient descent guarantees without relying on convexity. This is a significant departure from much of the existing literature in this area and offers the potential for broader applicability of the results. The technique of leveraging the eigenfunction property of parities with respect to the operator Jσ is also interesting.
*   **Improved Iteration Complexity:** The claimed nO(k)log(1/ϵ) iteration complexity for learning degree-k polynomials, if substantiated, represents a significant improvement over existing nO(k)poly(1/ϵ) bounds in the Boolean setting. The authors explicitly attribute this to their avoidance of convexity arguments.
*   **Matching SQ Lower Bounds:** The paper correctly highlights that the achieved upper bounds for learning parities on both losses match known Statistical Query (SQ) lower bounds. This demonstrates a near-optimality result for gradient descent in this particular setting, given its SQ algorithm nature.
*   **Reasonable Model Assumptions:** The authors strive for more realistic model assumptions compared to some prior work, particularly regarding initialization and activation functions. The ReLU activation is a key example of this.
*   **Spectral Bias Result:** The corollary demonstrating the preferential learning of lower-degree Fourier components ("spectral bias") aligns with empirical observations and adds valuable insight into the training dynamics of neural networks.
*   **Agnostic Learning Guarantee:** The agnostic setting makes the results more practical than probably approximately correct (PAC) settings.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper suffers from a lack of clarity and conciseness in its presentation. The notation is dense and the arguments are often difficult to follow. The proofs, particularly in the appendix, require significant effort to unpack.
*   **Overselling the Avoidance of Convexity:** While the authors emphasize avoiding convexity, it's not entirely clear that convexity is completely absent. The focus on the output layer weights and the similarity to the Vempala & Wilmes (2019) approach, which, while not explicitly convex, still relies on specific properties of the loss landscape, warrants further scrutiny. The term "convexity" should be defined more thoroughly.
*   **Generalizability of Results:** The analysis is highly specific to the Boolean hypercube and parity functions. The applicability of the techniques and results to more complex or realistic data distributions remains unclear. Can the results be extended beyond the ReLU to other activation functions?
*   **Significance of Spectral Bias Result:** While interesting, the practical implications of the spectral bias result (Theorem 4.6) are not fully explored. How does this bias affect the generalization performance of the learned networks? The presentation could benefit from an example.
*   **Missing related works:** The conference "COLT" has also explored learning parities in various settings. The authors should compare their results with other existing work on "online learning" or "bandit learning" of parities.

**Major concerns:**

*   **Verification of Proofs:** Given the complexity and density of the proofs, thorough verification is essential. It is difficult to assess the correctness of the claims without a detailed examination of the appendix.
*   **The discussion of learning rate:** The constants "cm", "cδ", and "ct" are not defined in the same order as their appearances in the text, making the writing more confusing.

**Overall:**

The paper presents a potentially valuable contribution to the theoretical understanding of neural network training for Boolean functions. The claimed improvements in iteration complexity and the avoidance of convexity arguments are promising. However, the lack of clarity in the presentation and the need for rigorous verification of the proofs are significant weaknesses.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Improve clarity and readability:** Simplify the notation, provide more intuitive explanations of the arguments, and improve the overall organization of the paper.
*   **Provide a more nuanced discussion of convexity:** Clarify the extent to which convexity is actually avoided in the analysis and discuss the potential impact of other properties of the loss landscape.
*   **Discuss the generalizability of the results:** Address the limitations of the analysis and discuss the potential for extending the techniques and results to more complex settings.
*   **Thoroughly verify the proofs:** Ensure the correctness of all claims through rigorous verification of the proofs in the appendix.
*   **Define the constants used throughout the theorems and lemma.**
*   **Compare the results to existing work in "online learning" and "bandit learning".**

**The paper does not seem to discuss how the results relate to the term "conditional average treatment effect" which may or may not be a limitation depending on the author's goals.**

**Rating:** (Assuming claims are verified after revision) Borderline Accept. Requires significant revision to address the weaknesses outlined above before it can be considered for publication.
