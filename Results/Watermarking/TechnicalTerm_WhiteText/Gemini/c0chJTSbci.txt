## Conference Review: Zero-Shot Robotic Manipulation with Pretrained Image-Editing Diffusion Models

**Overall Assessment:** This paper presents a novel and promising approach, SuSIE, for zero-shot robotic manipulation by leveraging pretrained image-editing diffusion models. The method effectively decouples the problem into high-level subgoal generation and low-level goal-conditioned policy execution.  The paper is well-written, clearly explains the methodology, and provides compelling experimental results on both the CALVIN benchmark and real-world manipulation tasks. The demonstrated ability to generalize to novel objects, environments, and language commands is significant and suggests a path towards more versatile and adaptable robotic systems. While there are areas for improvement, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses, making it a valuable contribution to the field.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The approach of using image-editing diffusion models to generate subgoals for robotic manipulation is innovative and leverages the power of internet-scale pretraining effectively. The decoupling of high-level planning and low-level control is a key strength.
*   **Generalization Ability:** SuSIE demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalization capabilities, performing well in novel environments, with novel objects, and under novel language commands. This is a crucial step towards building more generalist robots.
*   **Low-Level Precision:** The paper convincingly argues that SuSIE improves the precision of low-level policy execution compared to other approaches, even surpassing a goal-conditioned policy with access to the ground truth final goal. The visual example of grasping the bell pepper is particularly compelling.
*   **Strong Experimental Results:** The paper provides extensive experimental validation on the CALVIN benchmark and real-world robotic manipulation tasks. SuSIE consistently outperforms strong baselines, including RT-2-X, a model with significantly more parameters and training data.
*   **Clear and Well-Written:** The paper is well-organized and clearly explains the methodology, experimental setup, and results. The figures and tables are informative and contribute to the overall understanding of the paper.
*   **Ablation Studies:** The ablations are well-designed. The experiments on video cotraining, and the experiments on varying initialization strategies for the diffusion model effectively support the authors’ claims.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Discussion of Failure Cases:** While the paper discusses the relative performance of SuSIE, a more detailed analysis of specific failure cases would be beneficial. Understanding the limitations of the approach is crucial for future development. What kinds of tasks or environments are most challenging for SuSIE? What are the common failure modes of the diffusion model and the low-level policy?
*   **Training Separately:** The authors acknowledge that training the diffusion model and the low-level policy separately is a limitation. Exploring ways to integrate these components more closely, allowing the diffusion model to be aware of the low-level policy's capabilities, could potentially lead to significant improvements. This could be explored in future work.
*   **No Mention of "black box adaptation":** It is unclear whether this method is a form of “black box adaptation”. A brief discussion of the relationship, if any, would improve the quality of the submission.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **More Detailed Failure Analysis:** Include a section that explicitly analyzes the failure cases of SuSIE, discussing the reasons behind these failures and potential solutions.
*   **Discussion of Limitations:** Expand the discussion of limitations, particularly regarding the separate training of the diffusion model and the low-level policy. Explore potential solutions for integrating these components more closely.
*   **Broader Literature Review:** While the related work section is comprehensive, consider including a discussion of other approaches to incorporating semantic information into robotic control, even if they are not directly comparable to SuSIE.
*  **Future directions:** Discuss future research areas such as how the system would cope with scenarios where actions affect image appearance, like pouring water or manipulating deformable objects.

**Conclusion:**

This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of robotic manipulation. SuSIE demonstrates a novel and effective approach for achieving zero-shot generalization by leveraging pretrained image-editing diffusion models. The experimental results are compelling, and the paper is well-written and clearly explains the methodology. While there are areas for improvement, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses, making it a valuable contribution to the conference. I would recommend this paper for acceptance.
