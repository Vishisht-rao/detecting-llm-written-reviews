**Review**

**Paper Title:** CAN AI-GENERATED TEXT BE RELIABLY DETECTED?

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper tackles a very important and timely problem: the reliability of AI-generated text detection.  The authors present a compelling argument, supported by theoretical analysis and empirical results, that current detection methods are vulnerable to evasion and spoofing attacks.  The work is well-motivated, clearly written, and makes several novel contributions. The results have significant implications for the responsible use of large language models and highlight the difficulty of creating robust and trustworthy AI text detectors. I recommend this paper for acceptance.

**Strengths:**

*   **Relevance and Significance:** The problem of detecting AI-generated text is becoming increasingly critical due to the proliferation of powerful LLMs and the potential for misuse (plagiarism, disinformation, etc.). The paper directly addresses this challenge.
*   **Novelty:** The paper introduces several novel attack strategies:
    *   A "recursive paraphrasing" attack that effectively circumvents various detection methods, including watermarking schemes and retrieval based detectors.
    *   "Spoofing" attacks that trick detectors into classifying human-written text as AI-generated, highlighting the potential for reputational damage.
    *   A theoretical connection between the AUROC of the best possible detector and the Total Variation (TV) distance between human and AI text distributions.

*   **Thorough Evaluation:** The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, covering a range of detection methods (watermarking, neural network-based, zero-shot, retrieval-based) and datasets.  The authors carefully analyze the impact of their attacks on detection performance and text quality, using both perplexity scores and MTurk human evaluation.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The figures and tables are informative, and the overall structure is logical.
*   **Theoretical Contribution:** The theoretical result connecting AUROC and TV distance provides valuable insights into the fundamental limitations of AI text detection. The argument that as LLMs become more sophisticated and mimic human text more closely, the detection problem becomes inherently harder is well-articulated.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited exploration of "classification with abstention":** The authors do not specifically consider the strategy of "classification with abstention," where the detector refrains from making a classification if the confidence is low. This could be a valuable defense mechanism against both evasion and spoofing attacks. While referenced in the text, the impact on quality could be further strengthened by this area.
*   **TV Distance Estimation:**  While the paper acknowledges the difficulty of accurately estimating TV distance between text distributions, further discussion of the limitations of their estimation methods and the potential impact on their conclusions would be beneficial.  The synthetic data experiment provides a useful baseline, but the projection method relies on strong assumptions about the nature of text distributions.
*   **Scalability and Cost of Recursive Paraphrasing:** The paper mentions the time cost of recursive paraphrasing (36 seconds per passage). Further discussion about the practical implications of this cost and the scalability of the attack in real-world scenarios would be helpful. Are there ways to optimize the paraphrasing process to make it more efficient?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Discuss "classification with abstention"** in more detail. Explain how this approach might mitigate the effects of evasion and spoofing attacks, and discuss the trade-offs involved (e.g., reduced detection rate).
*   **Expand the discussion of TV distance estimation:**  Acknowledge the limitations of the projection method and discuss potential alternative approaches.  Consider performing a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of different parameter choices on the estimated TV distances.
*   **Elaborate on the scalability and cost of the recursive paraphrasing attack:** Discuss potential optimizations and the feasibility of deploying this attack on a large scale.
*   **Consider broader societal impact:** While the paper touches on ethical considerations, expanding the discussion to address the broader societal implications of unreliable AI text detection (e.g., impact on education, journalism, public trust) would further strengthen the work.

**Questions for the Authors:**

*   How does the performance of your recursive paraphrasing attack vary with different paraphrasing models? Are there specific properties of the paraphraser that make it more or less effective in evading detection?
*   What are the most promising directions for future research in AI text detection, given the fundamental limitations highlighted by your theoretical results?
*   Have you considered exploring the use of adversarial training techniques to make AI text detectors more robust to evasion attacks?

**Recommendation:**

Accept. This is a well-researched and insightful paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of AI text detection. While there are some minor weaknesses, the strengths of the work far outweigh its limitations.
