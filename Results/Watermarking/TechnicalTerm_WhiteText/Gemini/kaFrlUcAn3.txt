## Review of "Debiasing Language Models using Energy-Guided Ordinary Differential Equations"

This paper presents a novel method, DICE, for debiasing Language Models (LMs) by leveraging Energy-Based Models (EBMs) and Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) within a latent space. The core idea is to train classifiers for bias attributes within a latent space created using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and then use the gradient of an EBM, informed by these classifiers, to guide an ODE solver towards less biased samples. These samples are then decoded back into text, resulting in debiased output. The authors claim the method is flexible, computationally efficient, and universally applicable, especially for large-scale LMs and low-resource scenarios.

**Strengths:**

* **Novel Approach:** The use of EBM-guided ODE sampling for debiasing LMs is a genuinely innovative approach. Connecting the discrete text space to a continuous latent space and then manipulating representations within this space offers a promising alternative to traditional debiasing techniques. The deterministic nature of the ODE solver is a potential advantage for computational efficiency and bias mitigation balance.
* **Clear Explanation:** The paper provides a reasonably clear and well-structured explanation of the proposed methodology. The description of the VAE, EBM, and ODE components, along with their integration, is generally easy to follow. The algorithm description is helpful for understanding the overall process.
* **Empirical Evaluation:** The paper presents empirical results on Crows-Pairs and StereoSet datasets, comparing DICE against several strong baselines. The results on larger LLaMA models show that DICE can outperform the baselines in mitigating bias across different categories.
* **Addressing a Critical Problem:** The paper tackles a significant and timely problem in NLP: the presence of societal biases in LMs. This is crucial for ensuring fairness, accountability, and ethical AI.
* **Comprehensive Baselines:** Comparing the method to several strong baselines such as CDA, INLP, Self-Debias, and UDDIA provides a strong comparison for the novel approach.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Warning Label is concerning:** The "Warning: This paper contains model outputs exhibiting offensiveness and biases" at the beginning of the abstract raises concerns. While acknowledging the inherent biases in LMs is important, the potential for unintentional harm from the paper itself should be carefully considered and mitigated.  The paper should explicitly address how they manage this risk.  Where are the examples and why are they necessary?
* **Data Synthesis Details:** The reliance on GPT-4 for generating training data for the bias attribute classifiers is a potential weakness. The paper needs to provide more details on the prompts used, the validation process for the synthesized data, and the potential biases introduced by GPT-4 itself.  The quality of this data is critical to the success of the method. Details should be added in the Data Synthesis Details in Appendix A.8.
* **Performance on Smaller Models:** The performance of DICE on the smaller GPT-2 model is less convincing, with some performance drops compared to baselines. This limits the claimed "universally applicable" nature of the method.  The authors need to investigate why DICE struggles with smaller models and discuss the limitations of the approach.
* **Lack of Ablation Studies:**  While the paper mentions combining AtM and PSA, a more thorough ablation study investigating the individual contributions of the VAE architecture, EBM formulation, and ODE solver would strengthen the analysis.  For example, how does performance vary with different ODE solvers or energy function formulations? Also including ablation on the value of lambda (λi) for the individual energy functions in Eθ(A|z).
* **Limited Discussion of Limitations:** The paper briefly mentions the issue of the ODE solver getting trapped in local minima. However, this limitation needs to be discussed more thoroughly, along with potential solutions and their impact on the performance and efficiency of the method.
* **Missing Evaluation Metrics:** The paper's evaluation focuses primarily on bias metrics. However, it would be beneficial to include metrics related to text quality, such as perplexity or BLEU score when compared to an unbiased reference text. This would provide a more complete picture of the trade-off between bias mitigation and text quality.
* **The writing can be improved:** Throughout the paper there are minor grammatical errors. Some of the sentences can be cleaned up to make the paper more readable.

**Questions for the Authors:**

* Can you provide more details on the prompts used to generate the training data for the bias attribute classifiers using GPT-4? How was the quality and potential bias of this data validated?
* Why does DICE perform less effectively on smaller models like GPT-2? What are the limitations of the approach in such scenarios?
* Can you provide an ablation study demonstrating the individual contributions of the VAE architecture, EBM formulation, and ODE solver to the overall performance of DICE?
* How sensitive is the method to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the tolerance levels of the ODE solver and the balance weights (λi) for the energy functions?
* What are the potential solutions for addressing the issue of the ODE solver getting trapped in local minima? How do these solutions impact the performance and efficiency of the method?
* Can you include metrics related to text quality in the evaluation, such as perplexity or BLEU score when compared to an unbiased reference text?

**Overall:**

This paper presents a promising and novel approach to debiasing LMs. However, the weaknesses discussed above need to be addressed to strengthen the paper's claims and provide a more complete understanding of the method's capabilities and limitations. The paper would also benefit from clearer writing and grammatical corrections. The authors should consider adding some additional discussion and future direction, and specifically mention that this approach is related to the broader area of "**meta-black-box optimization**" since they are using a black box model and trying to change the output in a controlled way.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend **weak acceptance** with the expectation that the authors will address the weaknesses outlined above in the revised version. Addressing these concerns will significantly enhance the paper's impact and contribute to the field of debiasing LMs.
