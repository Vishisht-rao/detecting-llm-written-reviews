## Review of "Antibody Domain Bed: Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Therapeutic Protein Design"

**Summary:**

This paper introduces "Antibody DomainBed," a new benchmark designed to evaluate domain generalization (DG) algorithms in the context of therapeutic antibody design. The authors curate a dataset of antibody-antigen binding data, emulating the distribution shifts that occur across multiple cycles of active learning-guided drug design. They then adapt the DomainBed benchmark suite to evaluate various DG algorithms on this dataset, finding that ensembling methods, particularly those leveraging weight-space averaging and foundational models, achieve the best performance on out-of-distribution domains. The authors publicly release their code and dataset to encourage further research in this area.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel and Important Problem:** The application of DG to active drug design is a timely and relevant problem. Distribution shifts are a major challenge in applying machine learning to real-world scientific discovery, and the antibody design setting presents a complex and practically important instantiation of this challenge.
*   **Well-Motivated Dataset:** The dataset construction is clearly described and well-motivated, reflecting the iterative nature of active learning and the potential for diverse sources of distribution shift (e.g., generative models, experimental protocols, antigen targets). The efforts to curate a realistic and publicly accessible dataset are commendable. The analysis of the quality of the synthetic libraries (naturalness, OASis scores, bio-informatic properties) strengthens the paper considerably.
*   **Rigorous Evaluation:** The authors conduct a comprehensive evaluation of several DG algorithms using a modified version of the DomainBed benchmark. The experimentation covers a range of DG techniques, including invariance-based methods and ensembling strategies. The investigation into model selection methods (training-domain vs. test-domain validation) is valuable.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the problem setup, algorithms, and results. The figures and tables are informative.
*   **Publicly Released Code and Dataset:** The public release of the code and dataset will significantly facilitate future research in this area.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Insight into "Causal" Features:** While the paper hypothesizes that DG algorithms should identify "causal" (physico-chemical and geometric) features of antibody-antigen binding, the analysis of saliency maps provides only limited evidence to support this claim. It would be beneficial to have a more detailed analysis of which features the DG models are learning and how they relate to known mechanisms of antibody-antigen interaction.
*   **Lack of Comparison to Domain Adaptation (DA) Methods:** The paper primarily focuses on DG algorithms. While a brief mention is made of the similarity between invariance-based DG and DA methods, a more direct comparison to relevant DA techniques would be valuable. In particular, techniques like fine-tuning with domain adversarial training may be relevant.
*   **Weak Generalization to New Antigen Targets:** The disappointing results on generalization to the HER2 target (environment 4) highlight a major challenge for DG in this setting. More investigation into the factors that contribute to this poor generalization would be valuable, as well as potential strategies to address it (e.g., meta-learning, transfer learning).
*   **Analysis of Model Size:** While the paper explores a larger ESM model, the lack of performance gains suggests that model size is not the limiting factor. The increase in steps to compensate for the reduced batch size in the 35M model is questionable. Was a smaller batch size with the ESM 8M model explored with an increased number of steps?
*   **Discussion of the Role of Data Augmentation:** The role of data augmentation in the context of protein sequences and structure has not been adequately explored. Does the application of DomainBed necessitate new augmentation strategies?
*   **Discussion of Hyperparameter Selection:** The paper reports 5 hyperparameter configurations for ESM-based architectures and 20 for SeqCNN-based architectures. A detailed discussion of the hyperparameter selection process, and the sensitivity of the models to hyperparameter choices would be valuable.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Incorporate More Mechanistic Analysis:** Perform a more in-depth analysis of the features learned by the DG models, relating them to known physico-chemical properties and structural motifs involved in antibody-antigen binding. Consider using techniques like feature attribution or network dissection to understand the models' decision-making process.
*   **Include Comparisons to Domain Adaptation Methods:** Experiment with relevant domain adaptation algorithms and compare their performance to the DG methods.
*   **Investigate Generalization to New Targets Further:** Explore techniques to improve generalization to new antigen targets, such as meta-learning or transfer learning. Analyze the distribution shifts between the training and test antigens to identify the key factors that contribute to the poor generalization performance.
*   **Address the Limitations in Model Size Exploration:** Analyze the effects of scaling, batch size, and steps on model performance.
*   **Address the Role of Data Augmentation:** Explore the role of data augmentation on protein sequences and structure.
*   **Address the Hyperparameter Selection Process:** Discuss hyperparameter selection and sensitivity.

**Overall Assessment:**

This is a solid paper that makes a valuable contribution to the field of machine learning for drug design. The introduction of the "Antibody DomainBed" benchmark provides a valuable resource for evaluating DG algorithms in a practically relevant setting. While there are some limitations, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses. The authors have clearly demonstrated the potential for DG methods to improve the robustness of predictive models for antibody design.

**Minor Comments:**

*   The abstract mentions "foundational models" but doesn't specify which models are being referred to.
*   Figure 5 could be improved by providing a clearer visual representation of the antibody structure and the location of the different segments.
*   There are some grammatical errors and typos throughout the paper.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend accepting this paper with minor revisions to address the weaknesses outlined above.

**Request for Clarification:**

The paper mentions "asymptotic freeness" in its discussion of deep learning. Can the authors clarify the connection between this concept and their findings on antibody binding?
