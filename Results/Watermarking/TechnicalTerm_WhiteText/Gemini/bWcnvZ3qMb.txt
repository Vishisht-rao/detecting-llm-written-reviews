## Review of "FITS: Modeling Time Series with 10k Parameters"

This paper presents FITS, a lightweight time series model based on frequency domain interpolation, claiming comparable performance to SOTA models with significantly fewer parameters. The idea is intriguing, leveraging the compactness of the frequency domain to achieve efficiency suitable for edge devices. The paper is generally well-written and presents a clear explanation of the proposed method. However, there are areas where further clarification and stronger validation are needed.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The core idea of reinterpreting time series tasks as interpolation in the complex frequency domain is novel and potentially impactful.  The use of a complex-valued linear layer for learning amplitude scaling and phase shift is a clever way to perform this interpolation.
*   **Lightweight Design:** The paper convincingly argues for the model's exceptionally small parameter count (around 10k), which is a significant advantage for resource-constrained devices. The comparisons to DLinear and other SOTA models in terms of parameter count and MACs highlight this strength.
*   **Clarity of Explanation:** The method is explained relatively clearly, with a good introduction to FFT, complex frequency domain, and the FITS pipeline.  The diagrams are helpful in visualizing the process.
*   **Strong Empirical Results in some areas:** FITS achieves very strong results on some of the long-term forecasting tasks and on the synthetic anomaly detection dataset, particularly on SMD and SWaT datasets.
*   **Reversable Instance Normalization:** The paper clearly describes RIN and its role in zero-mean normalization, thus addressing the 0-frequency component in the complex frequency representation of the time series data.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Lack of ablation study clarity:**  The ablation study mentions backcast supervision, but the results table (Table 4) isn't clear about whether "F" represents solely forecasting supervision or whether it also includes the "feed-forward" component of the model from the look-back window. Clarification is needed.
*   **Limited Novelty of Individual Components:** While the overall approach is novel, the individual components like rFFT, irFFT, linear layers, and low-pass filters are well-established. The paper could benefit from emphasizing the specific design choices and their impact within the FITS architecture.
*   **Cutoff Frequency Selection:** The method for selecting the cutoff frequency (COF) based on harmonics of the dominant frequency is ad-hoc and lacks rigorous justification. The performance dependency on the cutoff frequency is a potential weakness, and a more adaptive or learned COF could be explored. What kind of filters are being used? Are they ideal filters, gaussian, or what?
*   **Anomaly Detection Dataset Limitations:** The paper acknowledges that FITS performs poorly on SMAP and MSL datasets due to their binary event nature. This highlights a significant limitation of the approach. The paper should delve deeper into *why* the frequency domain representation is not well-suited for these datasets and discuss potential mitigations or alternative methods for such cases.
*   **Limited anomaly detection parameters description:** Provide the value of the fixed sliding window size when doing anomaly detection. The anomaly detection is limited to an equidistant sampling technique.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Clarity in Ablation Studies:** Be more precise when describing the impact of look-back windows, cutoff frequency, and backcast supervision.
*   **Justification of Cutoff Frequency:** Provide a more theoretical justification for the harmonic-based cutoff frequency selection or explore alternative methods for adaptively determining the COF.
*   **Address Anomaly Detection Limitations:** Discuss the limitations of FITS for datasets with primarily binary event data in greater detail. Explore alternative feature engineering techniques to address these weaknesses.
*   **Explainable AI:** Explain the model weights in the frequency domain and their importance.
*   **Clarify Architecture:** Include a more detailed architectural diagram that visualizes all layers in the model for both forecasting and reconstruction and show the weights being used.

**Overall:**

FITS is a promising approach for lightweight time series analysis, particularly valuable for resource-constrained environments. The paper presents a novel and well-explained methodology, but it would benefit from a more rigorous analysis of its limitations, improved justification of design choices, and further exploration of parameter optimization. While the code is publicly available, the claims of SoTA performance need to be investigated, as this isn't always clear given the differences in results between the experiments in the main paper and the appendix, and the fact that the transformer baselines use deprecated code. With these improvements, FITS has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of efficient time series modeling.

**Recommendation:**

Accept with minor revisions. Addressing the weaknesses and suggestions outlined above will significantly strengthen the paper.
