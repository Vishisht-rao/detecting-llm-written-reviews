## Review of "Differentially Private Principal Component Analysis for Vertically Partitioned Data"

This paper tackles a challenging and important problem: differentially private Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in the vertical federated learning (VFL) setting. In this scenario, data is partitioned column-wise across multiple clients, presenting unique privacy challenges compared to the more commonly studied horizontal federated learning. The authors propose a novel algorithm, SPCA, that aims to achieve a strong privacy-utility tradeoff without relying on any trusted third party.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Relevance:** The paper addresses a critical gap in the literature. While DP has been well-studied in horizontal FL, its application to vertical FL, especially for non-linear tasks like PCA, is relatively limited. VFL is a common scenario in cross-silo settings, making this work highly relevant.
*   **Novel Approach:** SPCA offers a fresh perspective by combining secure multiparty computation (MPC) with carefully calibrated Skellam noise injection. This approach allows the clients to collaboratively compute PCA in a privacy-preserving manner, protecting against both the server and other clients.
*   **Strong Theoretical Guarantees:** The paper provides rigorous theoretical analysis, proving that SPCA achieves both server-observed and client-observed differential privacy. Importantly, the authors demonstrate that SPCA's utility (error rate) matches the optimal centralized baseline, a significant improvement over existing VFL algorithms.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The experimental results on real-world datasets (KDDCUP, ACSIncome, CiteSeer, and Gene) convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of SPCA. The algorithm consistently outperforms a distributed baseline and achieves results close to the centralized-DP baseline, validating the theoretical findings.
*   **Clear and Well-Structured:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the problem definition, proposed solution, and analysis. The inclusion of concrete examples and baseline comparisons further enhances understanding.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Semi-Honest Threat Model:** The paper assumes a semi-honest threat model, where clients follow the protocol but may try to infer private information. This is a common starting point, but the robustness of SPCA against malicious clients, who may deviate from the protocol, is not addressed.
*   **Overhead Discussion:** While the authors claim the DP overhead is manageable, a more detailed analysis of the computational and communication costs, especially scaling with the number of clients, would be beneficial. Concrete runtime metrics in the experiments would further strengthen this claim.
*   **Scalability with Very Large Datasets:** While the experiments cover a range of dataset sizes, a discussion about the scalability of SPCA to extremely large, high-dimensional datasets, which are common in some VFL applications, would be worthwhile.
*   **Limited Discussion of Discretization Parameter:** The authors suggest setting the discretization parameter γ = O(n). More guidance on how to choose γ effectively in practice, balancing privacy, utility, and computational cost, would be helpful.

**Specific Comments and Questions:**

*   It would be beneficial to include a table summarizing the notations used throughout the paper for easier reference.
*   The choice of Skellam noise is well-motivated, but a more detailed explanation of why it's preferred over other discrete noise distributions would strengthen the argument.
*   The proof of Lemma 11 could be made more accessible by providing more detailed steps for bounding the spectral norm of the random matrices.
*   The authors state "the overhead due to DP is not significant". Quantifying this overhead (e.g., in terms of communication or computation) would make this claim more convincing.
*   How does SPCA handle missing data or outliers in the vertically partitioned datasets? Does pre-processing on the clients' side affect the privacy guarantees?

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of differentially private federated learning. The proposed SPCA algorithm offers a novel and effective solution for PCA in the vertical setting, with rigorous theoretical guarantees and compelling experimental results. Addressing the weaknesses mentioned above would further strengthen the paper. The paper makes a valuable contribution to the understanding of "learning with varying data" constraints.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend this paper for acceptance, conditional on addressing the minor weaknesses and questions raised above.
