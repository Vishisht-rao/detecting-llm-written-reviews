## Review of L2P-MIP: Learning to Presolve for Mixed Integer Programming

This paper introduces L2P-MIP, a novel approach to improving Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) solvers by learning instance-specific presolving strategies. The core idea is to move away from instance-agnostic default presolving settings and tailor presolvers to individual MIP instances. The authors propose a two-stage approach: first, use simulated annealing (SA) to find near-optimal presolving parameters for each training instance; and second, train a neural network to predict these parameters for unseen instances. This allows for fast, instance-specific presolving at inference time.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** To the best of my knowledge, this is the first work exploring learning-based approaches to optimize presolving within MIP solvers. This fills a gap in the literature, as most learning-based MIP research focuses on branching and cutting planes *after* the presolving stage.
*   **Clear Motivation:** The paper clearly articulates the limitations of default presolving strategies and makes a strong case for instance-specific tailoring. The authors highlight that "an analysis of presolve would be incomplete without an investigation of this effect for particular instances."
*   **Well-Defined Methodology:** The proposed L2P-MIP framework is well-defined, with clear explanations of the SA-based search, feature extraction, and neural network architecture. The use of knowledge-based residual learning (KRL) to incorporate priority information is an interesting and promising approach. The dynamic loss averaging technique is also a sound design choice.
*   **Comprehensive Experiments:** The paper presents a thorough experimental evaluation across a diverse set of MIP datasets, ranging from synthetic benchmarks to real-world industrial instances. The results demonstrate the potential of L2P-MIP to improve solver performance, especially on medium and hard problems.
*   **Open-Source Code:** The availability of open-source code makes the work reproducible and facilitates future research in this area. This is a significant contribution to the ML4CO community.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Improvement on Easy Datasets:** The paper acknowledges that L2P-MIP shows limited improvement on easy datasets. While the reasoning provided (sufficient optimization by the solver) is plausible, further investigation into the characteristics of these instances and why they are not amenable to learned presolving could be beneficial.
*   **Comparison to "Iterated CVAR":** The work lacks any comparison to more traditional configuration techniques used on MIP solvers that iteratively optimize the Conditional Value at Risk. By not including such a comparison the paper is missing a key baselining component to contextualize the advantages of the proposed learning approach.
*   **Generalization Analysis:** While the paper includes a generalization test between MIRP small and large datasets, a more comprehensive analysis of how the learned models generalize to different problem types or distributions would be valuable.  Is there a risk of overfitting to specific instance characteristics within a given dataset? Table 4 touches on this but more explicit justification on why the current generalization is sufficient would be a good addition.
*   **Limited Justification of Simulated Annealing:** The paper uses simulated annealing (SA) to generate training data. While BO is dismissed because the variables are partly discrete, the paper provides little justification for its superior performance compared to other search-based or auto-configuration techniques in *this* problem setting beyond the ablation in Sec 3.4.  A more detailed explanation of the challenges and benefits of using SA for presolving parameter optimization would be helpful.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Further Analyze Easy Datasets:** Provide a more in-depth analysis of the easy datasets to explain why L2P-MIP fails to improve performance. Consider analyzing the structure of these instances and comparing them to the instances where L2P-MIP is effective.
*   **Comparison to iterated optimization methods:** Compare the work to a similar optimization method. The authors dismiss BO without providing justification beyond its variable type limitations, a comparison against common optimization techniques would better contextualize this work.
*   **Detailed Feature Importance Analysis:** Include an analysis of feature importance to identify which features of the MIP instances are most relevant for predicting optimal presolving parameters. This could provide valuable insights into the underlying relationships between instance characteristics and presolving strategies.
*   **Investigate the relationship between search process and final selection:** Discuss the variance in search outcomes from SA, and the relationship between them and the actual selection outcome of the network. Are there certain instances where the trained neural network can outperform the SA, and if so, what are the properties?
*   **Clarify Assumptions and Limitations:** Explicitly state the assumptions and limitations of the L2P-MIP framework. For example, the performance may be dependent on the specific set of presolvers available in the MIP solver. The paper can be made stronger by being more forthcoming about the limitations of the work.
*   **Consider alternative loss functions or training strategies:** The results on priority are not always significantly higher than the baselines. It might be worth trying different learning strategies or loss functions, perhaps ones that better represent the ordinal nature of the priority values.

**Overall:**

L2P-MIP is a promising and novel approach to learning instance-specific presolving strategies for MIP solvers. The paper is well-written, the methodology is sound, and the experimental results are encouraging. Addressing the weaknesses and incorporating the suggestions for improvement would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact. I recommend acceptance, contingent on addressing the above concerns.
