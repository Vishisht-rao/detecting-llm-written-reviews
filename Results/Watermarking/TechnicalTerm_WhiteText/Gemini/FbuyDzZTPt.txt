## Review of "OVOR: ONEPROMPT WITH VIRTUAL OUTLIER REGULARIZATION FOR REHEARSAL-FREE CLASS-INCREMENTAL LEARNING"

This paper presents a novel approach to rehearsal-free class-incremental learning (CIL) by introducing a virtual outlier regularization technique (VOR) and exploring the effectiveness of a single prompt-based method (OnePrompt). The core idea is to mitigate inter-task confusion, a known problem in rehearsal-free CIL, by tightening decision boundaries through regularization using virtually synthesized outliers. Furthermore, the paper challenges the common practice of employing a prompt pool with complex prompt composition mechanisms, advocating for a simpler, single-prompt approach.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The combination of virtual outlier regularization and a single-prompt approach for rehearsal-free CIL is a fresh perspective. The virtual outlier regularization technique is well-motivated by the problem of inter-task confusion and shows promising results. The idea of using a single prompt is a counter-intuitive but compelling exploration of prompt-based CIL.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and explains the concepts clearly. The introduction effectively highlights the challenges in rehearsal-free CIL and motivates the proposed approach. The method section provides a detailed explanation of VOR and OnePrompt. Algorithm 1 provides clear pseudocode for the OVOR training procedure.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The paper presents extensive experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets (ImageNet-R, CIFAR-100, CUB-200, ImageNet-A). The results demonstrate that VOR consistently improves the performance of various prompt-based methods. Importantly, the results show that OnePrompt, even without a prompt pool, can achieve comparable or superior performance to existing SOTA methods while using fewer parameters and requiring lower inference cost. The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the sensitivity of the proposed method to different hyperparameters.
*   **Efficiency:** The paper convincingly shows that OnePrompt offers significant advantages in terms of computational efficiency (FLOPs) and parameter count compared to methods relying on prompt pools and complex query mechanisms. This is a significant contribution to the field, as it demonstrates that competitive performance can be achieved with a simpler and more efficient approach.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors have made their source code publicly available, which is commendable and greatly enhances the reproducibility of the results. The appendices include detailed configuration information and ablation studies further contributing to reproducibility.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Discussion of Related Work on Outlier Detection:** While the paper cites relevant works on outlier synthesis, it could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of existing outlier detection techniques and how VOR differs from them. The paper mentions that it avoids training separate outlier detectors, but could elaborate on the advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared to explicit outlier detection.
*   **Scalability Concerns:** The paper acknowledges that the outlier generation process requires storing and searching among feature vectors, which may pose scalability issues with large datasets. This limitation should be more prominently addressed, and potential solutions (e.g., using approximate nearest neighbor search or sampling strategies) could be discussed.
*   **Generality:** The disclaimer at the end of the paper suggests it was prepared by the Global Technology Applied Research center of JPMorgan Chase & Co. While the paper states that it's for informational purposes, it is unclear how much of the work is intended for actual deployment in realistic scenarios.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand the discussion on related work in outlier detection and analysis.** Compare and contrast VOR with existing outlier detection techniques, highlighting the specific advantages of the proposed approach in the context of CIL.
*   **Address the scalability concerns more explicitly.** Discuss potential solutions for scaling VOR to larger datasets, such as using approximate nearest neighbor search or sampling strategies.
*   **Include information on the runtime of the outlier generation and regularization steps.** Quantify the overhead introduced by VOR and discuss the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost.
*   Consider including an experiment or discussion about the limitations of OnePrompt. Are there scenarios where a prompt pool is strictly better?
*   Consider mentioning "multilingual machine translation" in the related work, if relevant. While the current draft may not explicitly discuss this, exploring the connection to multilingual learning scenarios could broaden the scope and impact of the research.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of rehearsal-free class-incremental learning. The proposed virtual outlier regularization technique is a novel and effective way to mitigate inter-task confusion, and the exploration of a single-prompt approach challenges the common practice of using prompt pools. The paper is well-written, empirically validated, and reproducible. Addressing the minor weaknesses and suggestions for improvement outlined above would further strengthen the paper. I recommend acceptance.
