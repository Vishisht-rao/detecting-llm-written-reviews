## Review of "DART: D ISTRIBUTION SHIFT -AWARE PREDICTION REFINEMENT FOR TEST-TIME ADAPTATION"

This paper introduces DART, a novel test-time adaptation (TTA) method that addresses the performance degradation of existing TTA techniques under class distribution shifts. The authors identify that current TTA methods primarily focus on input distribution shifts, neglecting the impact of varying class distributions. DART aims to refine predictions by focusing on class-wise confusion patterns learned during an "enhancer annotation"-free, intermediate training phase using batches with diverse class distributions sampled from a Dirichlet distribution. The learned module is then used at test time to correct predictions based on the estimated pseudo-label distribution of the test data. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate DART's effectiveness in improving prediction accuracy and enhancing the performance of existing TTA methods.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Identification and Motivation:** The paper clearly identifies a significant limitation of existing TTA methods - their susceptibility to performance degradation under class distribution shifts. The initial benchmarking of BNAdapt on long-tailed datasets effectively highlights this issue. The observation that consistent class-wise confusion patterns exist across different input distribution shifts is interesting and serves as a solid foundation for the proposed approach. The toy example in the appendix provides further theoretical justification for this observation.
*   **Novelty of Approach:** DART presents a novel approach to TTA by explicitly addressing class distribution shifts.  The intermediate training phase using Dirichlet sampling to expose the distribution shift-aware module to diverse class distributions is a clever idea. Refining predictions by multiplying with a learned square matrix is a simple yet effective mechanism.
*   **Extensive Experimental Evaluation:** The paper provides a comprehensive experimental evaluation across a wide range of benchmarks (CIFAR, PACS, ImageNet, digit classification) and different types of distribution shifts (synthetic and natural).  Ablation studies are included to analyze the contribution of different components of DART, such as the online adaptation setting, diagonal/off-diagonal entries of the refinement matrix T, and comparison with other approaches for prediction modification like LSA. The experiments on the large-scale ImageNet-C dataset, addressing scalability issues by setting off-diagonal elements of T to zero, are also a valuable contribution. The inclusion of a comparison between Toracle and Ttest validates the effectiveness of the learned module.
*   **Clear Writing and Organization:** The paper is well-written and organized.  The problem setup and motivation are clearly explained, and the DART method is presented in a logical and easy-to-understand manner. The figures and tables are helpful in visualizing the proposed approach and experimental results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Computational Cost:** While the paper mentions runtime in Appendix A.6, a more detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the intermediate training phase and the prediction refinement process, especially on larger datasets like ImageNet-C, would be beneficial. How does the additional time compare to the runtime of the base TTA methods it enhances?
*   **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters (beyond what's in E.6):** While section E.6 discusses sensitivity to hyperparameters of the gϕ architecture, there could be more investigation into the sensitivity of DART's performance to the Dirichlet sampling parameters (δ and Ndir) and the selection of the intermediate dataset.  Are there guidelines or best practices for choosing these parameters?  The impact of differing intermediate dataset sizes is not directly addressed.
*   **"Enhancer annotation"-Free Intermediate Phase:** Although the intermediate phase is annotation-free in the test domain, it heavily relies on labeled data from the training domain. Clarifying this in the abstract and introduction could improve precision.
*   **Lack of comparison with methods that address Label Shift directly:** The paper presents DART as a novel solution to address issues associated with class distribution shifts at test time. It compares DART to existing TTA methods primarily designed for covariate shift. It would be helpful to include some discussion, potentially even experimental comparisons, to methods from the domain adaptation literature that directly address the label shift problem, even if these methods are not strictly TTA techniques. This would more clearly position DART with respect to existing approaches for handling class distribution shifts.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Quantify Computational Overhead:** Provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost (training time, inference time, memory usage) associated with DART, especially on large datasets, compared to the baseline TTA methods.
*   **Discuss Hyperparameter Sensitivity More Thoroughly:**  Expand the discussion on the sensitivity of DART's performance to the Dirichlet sampling parameters (δ and Ndir) and the intermediate dataset. Provide guidelines or heuristics for selecting these parameters.  Also, consider an ablation study on the size of the intermediate dataset.
*   **Clarify Terminology regarding the "enhancer annotation" requirements of the Intermediate Phase:**  Explicitly state in the abstract and introduction that the intermediate training phase utilizes labeled data from the *training* domain.
*   **Comparison with methods that address Label Shift directly**: Consider adding discussion, potentially even comparison in experiments, to traditional label shift adaptation methods.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a well-motivated and thoroughly evaluated TTA method that effectively addresses the challenge of class distribution shifts. The proposed approach is novel and the experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing TTA techniques. While there are some areas for improvement, as outlined above, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of test-time adaptation and is worthy of acceptance.
