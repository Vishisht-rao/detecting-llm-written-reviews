## Review of "DNA CT: DIFFUSION GUIDED MULTI -TASK 3D P OLICY LEARNING"

This paper introduces DNAct, a novel language-conditioned multi-task policy learning framework designed for robotic manipulation. The core idea is to leverage neural rendering for 3D semantic understanding combined with diffusion training to capture the multi-modality inherent in multi-task demonstrations. The paper presents promising results in both simulation and real-world settings, showcasing improvements over existing NeRF-based multi-task manipulation approaches.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Approach:** The combination of neural rendering pre-training with diffusion training for multi-task policy learning is a creative and potentially impactful idea. The paper clearly articulates the motivations for this hybrid approach, addressing the limitations of existing methods in terms of semantic understanding, multi-modality handling, and generalization.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The experimental section provides compelling evidence for the effectiveness of DNAct. The paper demonstrates significant performance gains over strong baselines (PerAct and GNFactor) across a range of RLBench tasks. The real-robot experiments further validate the method's applicability to real-world scenarios. The ablation studies are well-designed and provide valuable insights into the contribution of each component of DNAct. The generalization experiments highlight the robustness of DNAct to novel objects and arrangements.
*   **Efficient and Scalable:** The paper emphasizes the efficiency of DNAct, highlighting its smaller parameter size and faster inference time compared to baseline methods. This is a significant advantage for real-world deployment. The use of out-of-domain data for pre-training also suggests potential for improved scalability.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The introduction clearly outlines the problem, the proposed solution, and the contributions of the work. The method section provides a detailed explanation of the DNAct framework. The experimental section is comprehensive and provides sufficient details for reproducibility.
*   **Addresses limitations of Diffusion based policy directly:** The paper argues for a more stable and accurate policy by using diffusion models to guide representation learning rather than direct action prediction. This provides strong reasoning for the design decisions.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Novelty in Individual Components:** While the integration of neural rendering and diffusion training is novel, the individual components are relatively well-established. The paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of how DNAct innovates upon existing techniques in neural rendering and diffusion modeling.
*   **Limited Ablation of Diffusion Model Architecture:** While the paper does provide an ablation of the need for diffusion training, it does not provide insight on how the diffusion model itself could be further improved or adapted to enhance performance.
*   **Computational Cost Details:** The paper mentions the training time and GPU usage but lacks a thorough analysis of the overall computational cost of DNAct, including the pre-training phase. Providing a more detailed cost breakdown would be beneficial.
*   **Discussion of Failure Modes:** The paper focuses on the successes of DNAct but could benefit from a more detailed discussion of its limitations and potential failure modes. When does DNAct fail, and what are the possible reasons for these failures?
*   **"Principled Methods":** The paper does a good job arguing for each of its architectural choices, however, fails to explicitly situate it's work among existing *principled methods* for robotics manipulation. While the work is novel, it could have been more explicit about the connections to other "principled methods."
*   **Keyframe Selection Details:** Section 2.1 describes selecting keyframes using a velocity and gripper state metric. Details on thresholds used or other parameters would be helpful.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Elaborate on Novelty:** Provide a more detailed discussion of how DNAct innovates upon existing techniques in neural rendering and diffusion modeling.
*   **Computational Cost Analysis:** Include a more detailed breakdown of the computational cost of DNAct, including the pre-training phase.
*   **Discuss Failure Modes:** Add a section discussing the limitations and potential failure modes of DNAct.
*   **Add additional ablations:** The paper could benefit from an additional ablation of how the architecture and training parameters of the diffusion model itself impacted performance.

**Overall:**

DNAct is a promising approach to multi-task policy learning for robotic manipulation. The integration of neural rendering and diffusion training is a novel idea, and the experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods. While the paper has some weaknesses, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses.

**I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.**
