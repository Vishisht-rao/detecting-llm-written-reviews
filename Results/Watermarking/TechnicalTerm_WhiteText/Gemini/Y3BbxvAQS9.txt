## Review of "Controllable and Decomposed Diffusion Models for Structure-Based Molecular Optimization"

This paper presents DECOMP OPT, a novel method for structure-based molecular optimization that combines diffusion models with iterative optimization in a decomposed drug space. The central idea is to leverage the power of diffusion models to learn molecular grammar while using optimization to directly improve desired properties like binding affinity and synthesizability. A key contribution is the decomposition of ligands into substructures (arms and scaffold), enabling fine-grained control and offering a unified framework for both de novo design and controllable generation scenarios like R-group optimization and scaffold hopping.

**Strengths:**

* **Novelty and Significance:** The approach of combining diffusion models with decomposed optimization for SBDD is innovative and addresses a critical limitation of existing generative models – their inability to generate molecules with desired properties when the training data is lacking. The unified framework for de novo and controllable generation is also a significant contribution, as it tackles a broader range of practical drug discovery tasks.
* **Technical Soundness:** The paper provides a clear and well-structured explanation of the DECOMP OPT method, including the controllable and decomposed diffusion model, the condition encoder, and the optimization process. The use of SE(3)-equivariant neural networks is appropriate for handling 3D molecular structures. The design choices, such as the separation of control over arms and allowing scaffold diversity, are well-motivated.
* **Strong Experimental Results:** The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DECOMP OPT.  The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark, generating ligands with significantly improved binding affinities and a high success rate compared to strong de novo baselines.  The ablation studies validate the benefits of decomposed optimization and single-objective optimization. The results on R-group design and scaffold hopping showcase the potential of DECOMP OPT in controllable generation tasks.  The evaluation of molecular conformation also strengthens the credibility of the generated molecules.
* **Clear and Well-Written:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, with clear figures and tables. The introduction effectively highlights the problem, and the related work section provides a good overview of existing approaches.
* **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper includes a thorough evaluation, covering multiple metrics, including binding affinity, drug-likeness properties (QED, SA), diversity, and success rate. The comparison with multiple baselines, including both generative and optimization-based methods, is comprehensive.  The inclusion of supplementary material with additional implementation details and results is also valuable.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Lack of Clarity on Multi-Objective Optimization Details:** While the paper mentions the use of a multi-objective optimization score, the specific weights and criteria used to balance different objectives (e.g., QED, SA, Vina Min) could be described with more detail. How sensitive is the method to changes in these weights? Further justification or analysis of this aspect could strengthen the paper.
* **Limited Discussion of Potential Limitations:**  The paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion of potential limitations. For example, how well does DECOMP OPT generalize to novel targets outside the training data? How does the choice of decomposition method affect performance? Are there specific types of molecules or targets for which DECOMP OPT is less effective?
* **Missing Mention of a Common Loss Function:**  The paper does a great job of explaining the reconstruction loss, but omits a very commonly known term.  It would benefit from discussion of or if necessary, justifying the absence of the “triplet loss” function, especially given its utility in representation learning.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Provide more details on the multi-objective optimization score:**  Explain the rationale behind the chosen weights for QED, SA, and Vina Min, and discuss the sensitivity of the method to changes in these weights.
* **Discuss potential limitations and future research directions:**  Address the questions raised in the Weaknesses section regarding generalization, decomposition method, and limitations for specific molecule types.
* **Further explore the diversity-success rate trade-off:** While the trade-off is presented graphically, a more in-depth analysis of the factors influencing this trade-off would be valuable.
* **Add a small discussion regarding the “triplet loss” function in the model.**
* **Consider a section highlighting computational costs:**  A discussion about the computational resources required for training and inference would provide a more complete picture of the practical applicability of DECOMP OPT.

**Overall:**

DECOMP OPT is a promising approach for structure-based molecular optimization that addresses significant limitations of existing methods. The combination of diffusion models with decomposed optimization offers a powerful and flexible framework for generating novel ligands with desired properties.  The strong experimental results and clear presentation make this a valuable contribution to the field of drug discovery. Addressing the suggestions above would further strengthen the paper. I recommend acceptance.
