## Review of "FEDERATED Q-L EARNING : LINEAR REGRET SPEEDUP WITH LOW COMMUNICATION COST"

This paper tackles an important and challenging problem: achieving linear regret speedup with low communication costs in federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) for tabular episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The authors propose two model-free federated Q-learning algorithms, FedQ-Hoeffding and FedQ-Bernstein, and provide theoretical guarantees on both their regret and communication complexity. Overall, the paper is well-written, technically sound, and presents a significant contribution to the field.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** This paper addresses a critical gap in the literature by providing the first model-free FedRL algorithms with proven linear regret speedup and logarithmic communication cost. This is a significant step forward, as previous works often lacked regret guarantees or incurred high communication overhead.
*   **Algorithmic Design:** The algorithms incorporate several crucial design elements:
    *   Adaptive exploration policy selection, which is essential for achieving linear regret speedup and distinguishes the work from algorithms that use static sampling policies.
    *   Event-triggered policy switching and communication, which effectively reduces communication costs by minimizing unnecessary updates.
    *   A clever equal-weight assignment for global aggregation. This allows local agents to avoid sharing raw trajectories, further reducing communication cost.
*   **Theoretical Guarantees:** The paper provides rigorous theoretical analysis, proving linear regret speedup in the number of agents and logarithmic communication cost.  The regret bounds are comparable to those in the single-agent setting, demonstrating the effectiveness of the federated approach.
*   **Technical Novelty:** The analysis of the algorithms involves overcoming a significant technical challenge arising from the equal-weight assignment. This assignment leads to non-martingale differences in the weight assignments, making it difficult to track the cumulative estimation error. The authors develop novel concentration inequalities to bound the sum of these non-martingale differences, which is a valuable contribution in itself.
*   **Clear and Concise Presentation:** The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it relatively easy to follow the complex technical arguments.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors provide a link to code, enhancing the reproducibility of the results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Synthetic Environment:** The experimental evaluation relies solely on a synthetic environment. While this allows for controlled experiments and validation of theoretical results, it would be strengthened by including experiments on more realistic or benchmark RL environments.  How does performance scale beyond the small tabular setting?
*   **Practical Considerations:** While the algorithms are theoretically sound, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of practical considerations for implementation, particularly regarding the event-triggered synchronization mechanism. What are the potential challenges in real-world deployments with varying agent capabilities and communication latencies?
*   **Burn-in Cost:** The regret bounds include an overhead term related to the "burn-in" cost. While acknowledged, a more detailed analysis of the impact of this burn-in cost in different scenarios would be valuable. Under what conditions does the burn-in cost become a significant bottleneck?

**Minor Comments:**

*   The paper could benefit from a brief discussion of connections to Federated "MAB" in the related work section, given the commonalities in federated bandits and federated RL.
*   The notation in the appendices can be dense at times.  Consider adding brief reminders of key variable definitions as they are used.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents significant advances in the field of federated reinforcement learning. The proposed algorithms achieve a desirable trade-off between regret performance and communication cost, with strong theoretical guarantees. While the experimental evaluation could be expanded to include more realistic environments, the paper's theoretical contributions and algorithmic design make it a valuable contribution to the ICLR community.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend acceptance of this paper.
