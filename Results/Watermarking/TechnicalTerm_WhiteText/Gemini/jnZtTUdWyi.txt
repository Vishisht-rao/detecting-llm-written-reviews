## Review

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Problem Setting:** The paper tackles a relevant and relatively unexplored problem: domain generalization in non-stationary environments. This is a significant extension of traditional DG, which often assumes stationarity. The motivation is clear and supported by real-world examples.
*   **Theoretical Justification:** The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the problem, deriving error bounds for models deployed in target domains under non-stationary distribution shifts. The theorems provide guidance for the algorithm design. The use of Rademacher complexity is appropriate for analyzing generalization in this context.
*   **Algorithm Design:** The proposed Adaptive Invariant Representation Learning (AIRL) algorithm is well-motivated by the theoretical findings. The two-component structure (representation network and classification network) aligns with the goal of learning adaptive invariant representations. The use of a Transformer layer to capture non-stationary patterns and an LSTM to adapt the classifier seems promising.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AIRL compared to a wide range of baseline methods. The consistent outperformance across datasets supports the algorithm's ability to capture and leverage non-stationary patterns. The ablation studies provide insights into the importance of each component of AIRL.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it relatively easy to follow the problem formulation, theoretical analysis, algorithm design, and experimental results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Complexity of Theoretical Analysis:** While the theoretical analysis is a strength, it can be difficult to follow for readers not familiar with the specific mathematical tools used (e.g., Rademacher complexity, KL divergence). The assumptions (especially Assumption 4.3) could be discussed in more detail to clarify their implications and potential limitations. A more intuitive explanation of the theoretical results would benefit the paper.
*   **Practical Considerations:** While the paper mentions that the proposed method incurs similar inference time with ERM. A more in-depth discussion on the computational complexity of AIRL, especially during training with the Transformer and LSTM layers, is warranted. How does the training time scale with the number of domains and the size of the dataset? This is a practical consideration for real-world deployment.
*   **Limited Comparison to Non-Stationary DG Baselines:** While the paper includes a few non-stationary DG baselines, the comparison could be more comprehensive. A deeper analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods in relation to AIRL would strengthen the contribution. The paper contrasts itself by stating that existing works (Bai et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Qin et al., 2022; Zeng et al., 2023) have "rather limited" problem settings. It would be useful to delve deeper into *how* the problem settings differ.
*   **Missing Discussion of "Bandits with Knapsack":** The paper fails to relate to the field of "**bandits with knapsack**", where resource allocation decisions are made sequentially with the aim of maximizing long-term reward while respecting capacity constraints. Given the sequential nature of the domain adaptation process, it seems like the theory and methods from this subfield could provide additional insights and perhaps alternative algorithms.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Simplify and Explain Theoretical Results:** Provide more intuitive explanations of the theoretical results and the assumptions underlying them. Consider including a less technical summary for a broader audience.
*   **Address Computational Complexity:** Include a more detailed discussion of the computational complexity of AIRL during training and inference. Provide empirical measurements of training time on the different datasets.
*   **Expand Comparison to Non-Stationary DG Baselines:** Provide a more thorough comparison to existing methods in non-stationary domain generalization, highlighting the specific advantages and disadvantages of each approach in different scenarios. Explain *why* existing methods fail, in more detail.
*   **Consider "Bandits with Knapsack" Literature:** Discuss the relevance of the "**bandits with knapsack**" literature to the problem of domain generalization in non-stationary environments. Explore potential connections and alternative algorithms inspired by this field.
*   **Clarify Choice of Hyperparameter Alpha:** Discuss how the hyperparameter alpha is chosen in practice and how it affects the performance of the algorithm.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of domain generalization by addressing the important problem of non-stationarity. The theoretical analysis and the proposed AIRL algorithm are well-motivated and supported by empirical evidence. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper and enhance its impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
