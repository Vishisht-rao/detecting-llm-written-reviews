## Review: Unveiling and Manipulating Prompt Influence in Large Language Models

This paper introduces Token Distribution Dynamics (TDD), a novel approach to analyze and manipulate prompt influence in Large Language Models (LLMs). The core idea revolves around leveraging the language model head (LM head) to project input tokens into the embedding space and estimate their significance based on the resulting distribution dynamics. The paper presents three variants of TDD (forward, backward, and bidirectional), demonstrating its effectiveness in both interpreting prompt influence and manipulating LLM outputs for tasks like toxicity suppression and sentiment steering.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Approach:** TDD offers a fresh perspective on understanding input saliency in LLMs, moving away from reliance on linearity assumptions and potentially misaligned objectives inherent in existing gradient-based or attention-based methods. The idea of using token distributions as a proxy for token importance is innovative and well-motivated.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The paper presents comprehensive experimental results on the BLiMP benchmark, demonstrating that TDD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various LLMs and evaluation metrics (AOPC, Sufficiency). This provides compelling evidence for the superiority of TDD in elucidating causal relationships between prompts and LLM outputs.
*   **Practical Applications:** The paper showcases the practical utility of TDD by applying it to two important prompt manipulation tasks: zero-shot toxic language suppression and sentiment steering. The empirical results underscore TDD's ability to identify relevant cues in prompts and effectively control the generated content.
*   **Thorough Analysis and Extensions:** The paper includes a detailed analysis of the theoretical foundations of TDD, validating its generalizability to different LLM architectures. Furthermore, the extensions discussed (handling single/multiple target tokens, scenarios without alternative tokens) highlight the versatility of the proposed approach.
*   **Scalability Considerations:** The addition of experiments with larger models such as LLaMA2-13B and OPT-30B, as well as the report on computational costs, strengthens the paper by demonstrating the practicality and scalability of TDD.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the proposed methodology and understand the experimental results. The figures and tables are informative and effectively illustrate the key concepts.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Theoretical Justification:** While the paper validates the generalizability of token distribution dynamics to different LLMs empirically, a more rigorous theoretical justification for *why* these dynamics so accurately reflect token importance would strengthen the work. Connecting the observed dynamics to specific properties of the LLM's training or architecture could provide deeper insights.
*   **Reliance on the LM Head:** The method relies heavily on the LM head being a good "interpreter" of the internal representations. While experiments validate this empirically, it would be useful to understand the limitations of this assumption. Are there cases where the LM head might misinterpret the representations, leading to inaccurate saliency estimations?
*   **Comparison with AtMan:** The comparison with AtMan in the related work section is a bit weak. A direct empirical comparison with AtMan, especially in terms of computational efficiency and explanation faithfulness, would be more convincing.
*   **Qualitative Analysis Depth:** While the explanation visualization is helpful, a deeper qualitative analysis of *why* TDD identifies certain tokens as salient would further enhance the paper's contributions. Showing examples of TDD identifying non-obvious but crucial tokens and explaining the rationale behind this identification would be valuable.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Provide a stronger theoretical justification for the connection between token distribution dynamics and token importance.**
*   **Discuss potential limitations of relying solely on the LM head for interpretation.**
*   **Include a direct empirical comparison with AtMan, if feasible.**
*   **Expand the qualitative analysis with more insightful examples and explanations.**
*   **Explore different ways of aggregating the forward and backward saliency estimations in TDD-bidirectional. Is a simple summation the optimal approach?**
*   **Consider exploring the use of TDD in other prompt manipulation tasks beyond toxicity suppression and sentiment steering.**
*   **The paper would benefit from a discussion of how "biologically inspired modelling" techniques may provide future ways to model attention in LLMs.**

**Overall:**

This is a strong and well-executed paper that introduces a novel and effective approach to understanding and manipulating prompt influence in LLMs. The empirical results are compelling, and the practical applications are significant. The weaknesses are relatively minor and the suggestions for improvement are primarily aimed at further strengthening the theoretical foundations and expanding the scope of the analysis. I recommend accepting this paper for publication at ICLR 2024.
