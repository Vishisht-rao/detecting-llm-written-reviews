## Review of "LARGE-SCALE PUBLIC DATA IMPROVES DIFFERENTIALLY PRIVATE IMAGE GENERATION QUALITY"

This paper investigates the use of large-scale public data to improve the quality of differentially private (DP) image generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The key idea is to leverage pre-trained encoder-decoder architectures (specifically, IC-GAN) trained on public data (e.g., ImageNet) to learn a representation space, and then to privately adapt this representation to a smaller, private image dataset. The paper proposes two methods for this private adaptation: DP Multivariate Gaussian Estimation (DP-MGE) and DP Density Ratio Estimation (DP-DRE). The authors demonstrate that these methods achieve state-of-the-art FID scores and other metrics compared to existing public data-assisted DP image generation techniques, particularly in moderate to high privacy regimes.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Relevance:** DP image generation is a challenging problem, especially with limited private data. The paper addresses a practical scenario where abundant public data, albeit from a potentially different distribution, can be leveraged to improve generation quality. This setting is highly relevant in real-world applications.
*   **Clarity of Approach:** The proposed methods are clearly explained and well-motivated. The breakdown into encoder-decoder training, private feature distribution estimation, and image generation makes the approach easy to understand. Figure 1 provides a helpful visual overview.
*   **Technical Novelty:** While the individual components (DP-SGD, GANs, density ratio estimation) are not novel, the combination of these techniques in a pipeline specifically designed for leveraging non-identically distributed public data for DP image generation is a significant contribution.
*   **Strong Empirical Evaluation:** The paper presents a comprehensive experimental evaluation on six diverse image datasets. The comparison to several relevant baselines, including DP-GAN-FT, DP-MEPF, and DP-GAN-MI, strengthens the claims. The inclusion of precision, recall, and NDB metrics provides a holistic view of generation quality.
*   **Insightful Analysis:** The paper provides valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of DP-MGE and DP-DRE. The analysis of the impact of privacy levels (ε) and the discussion of the support assumption are particularly insightful.
*   **Well-Written:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Support Assumption Limitation:** The paper relies heavily on the assumption that the support of the public data distribution contains the support of the private data distribution. While this assumption is explicitly stated and discussed, the limited experiments exploring violations of this assumption (Chest X-Ray Images and Describable Textures Dataset) reveal a significant drop in performance.  Further investigation into how the methods degrade under varying degrees of support overlap could be beneficial.
*   **"Gender-Invariant" discussion is missing:** The paper does not touch the topic of potential bias in data used for training. The authors should consider whether image generation is "gender-invariant", and how to deal with such an issue in the framework proposed.
*   **IC-GAN Dependence:**  The methods are tightly coupled with the IC-GAN architecture. While the authors argue that this is a strength, it also limits the generalizability of the approach.  It would be interesting to see a discussion or preliminary experiments on how the proposed adaptation techniques could be applied to other GAN architectures, or potentially to other generative models such as diffusion models.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:**  The extensive hyperparameter tuning required for both the proposed methods and the baselines suggests that the performance may be sensitive to the specific choices. A more detailed analysis of the impact of different hyperparameters would be valuable.
*   **Lack of ablation study:** It is not clear, how much the density estimation helps and how much is provided by the IC-GAN. The authors might perform an ablation study, where they perform image generation without density estimation (i.e. random sampling from the latent space produced by the encoder) and compare it with their methods.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Elaborate on Support Assumption Violation:**  Conduct more experiments exploring the impact of varying degrees of support overlap between the public and private data distributions. Quantify the overlap using metrics like Fréchet distance or Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD).
*   **Investigate Alternatives to IC-GAN:** Discuss the potential applicability of the proposed adaptation techniques to other generative models, even if a full experimental evaluation is not feasible.
*   **Provide More Hyperparameter Analysis:**  Include a sensitivity analysis of key hyperparameters for DP-MGE and DP-DRE. Consider using techniques like parameter importance analysis or visualization of hyperparameter tuning results.
*   **Discuss Bias and Fairness:** Acknowledge and discuss the potential for bias in the public data to be amplified during DP image generation. Propose strategies for mitigating bias, such as data augmentation or bias-aware loss functions.
*   **Ablation study** Add an ablation study about density estimation.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that addresses a relevant and challenging problem in DP machine learning. The proposed methods are well-motivated and achieve impressive results. While the paper has some limitations, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses.  Addressing the suggested improvements would further enhance the impact of this work. I recommend this paper for acceptance, pending minor revisions to address the comments above.
