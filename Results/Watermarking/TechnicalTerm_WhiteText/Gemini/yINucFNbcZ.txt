## Review of "Improving the Efficiency of Conformal Predictors via Test-Time Augmentation"

This paper addresses a significant limitation of conformal prediction: the tendency to produce large, uninformative prediction sets, even with methods specifically designed to minimize set size. The authors propose a novel and practical approach using test-time augmentation (TTA) to improve the quality of the conformal score, a crucial element in conformal prediction. The core idea is to aggregate a classifier's predictions over a set of augmented inputs, thereby refining the predicted probabilities used in the conformal prediction process. The method is appealing due to its flexibility (can be combined with existing conformal scores), computational efficiency (no model retraining required), and demonstrated effectiveness in reducing prediction set sizes.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses an Important Problem:** The paper tackles a well-known and practically relevant issue in conformal prediction. The initial analysis clearly demonstrates the problem of large prediction sets in common datasets, motivating the need for improved efficiency.
*   **Novel and Intuitive Approach:**  Using TTA in the context of conformal prediction is a novel idea.  The intuition behind the approach, that TTA can improve the underlying classifier's probability estimates and therefore the conformal score, is clearly articulated.
*   **Strong Empirical Evaluation:** The paper provides a thorough empirical evaluation across a range of datasets (ImageNet, iNaturalist, CUB-Birds), models (ResNet-50, ResNet-101, ResNet-152), conformal scores (APS, RAPS), and coverage values.  The results consistently show that the proposed "TTA-Learned" method reduces prediction set sizes while maintaining coverage. The ablation studies dissecting the impact of different augmentation policies and the dependence on the dataset and base classifier are particularly valuable.
*   **Practical Implications:** The method requires no model retraining and can be readily integrated into existing conformal prediction pipelines, making it highly practical. The observation that TTA can bridge the performance gap between classifiers of different sizes (e.g., ResNet-50 with TTA outperforming ResNet-101 alone) is a valuable contribution.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is well-written and organized. The background on conformal prediction and TTA is concise but sufficient. The method is clearly explained, and the experimental setup is described in detail, facilitating reproducibility. The figures and tables are well-chosen and effectively communicate the results. The extensive appendix containing additional experiments and ablations is also a plus.
*   **Addresses Adaptivity:** The paper doesn't only focus on set size reduction, but also evaluates adaptivity through the size-stratified coverage violation (SSCV), further validating the approach.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Exploration of TTA Policies:**  While the paper explores two augmentation policies (simple and expanded), there could be further investigation into the impact of different augmentations and the optimal policy for specific datasets and models.  The claim that the learned weights indicate which augmentations are most useful could be further supported with more detailed analysis and interpretation of the learned weights.  It would be beneficial to see if techniques for automatically discovering optimal TTA policies could be integrated.
*   **Dataset Dependency:** The paper acknowledges that TTA is more effective on ImageNet and iNaturalist than on CUB-Birds, potentially due to the smaller calibration set size in CUB-Birds.  Further investigation into the factors that influence the effectiveness of TTA in conformal prediction would be beneficial.  For example, is the benefit tied to the domain itself (natural images vs. other data types), or are there dataset characteristics that predict the performance of the approach?
*   **Computational Cost:** The paper mentions that the computational cost scales linearly with the number of augmentations.  While the method avoids retraining, the increased inference time due to multiple forward passes could be a concern in some applications. It would be helpful to include a discussion of the trade-off between set size reduction and computational cost, and potentially explore strategies for reducing the computational burden of TTA (e.g., selecting a subset of augmentations based on the learned weights).
*   **Missing Term:** While the paper covers Ensemble methods for conformal prediction, it fails to mention the term "model composition". It could benefit by extending the discussion to incorporate the topic of "model composition".

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Augmentation Policy Optimization:** Explore techniques for automatically learning or optimizing the TTA policy. Can reinforcement learning or other methods be used to select the most effective set of augmentations for a given dataset and model?
*   **Computational Cost Analysis:**  Provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of TTA, including inference time and memory requirements.  Explore strategies for reducing the computational overhead.
*   **Dataset Characteristics:**  Investigate the dataset characteristics that influence the effectiveness of TTA in conformal prediction.  Are there specific data properties that make TTA more or less beneficial?
*   **Extend to other modalities:** While image classification is a good starting point, consider how the principles of this approach could be applied to other data modalities, such as text or time series data. What types of augmentations would be appropriate for those domains?
*   **Expand Discussion:** Incorporate the term "model composition" into the discussion of conformal prediction.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and practical approach to improving the efficiency of conformal prediction. The method is well-motivated, thoroughly evaluated, and clearly presented. The paper makes a valuable contribution to the field and has the potential to significantly improve the usability of conformal prediction in real-world applications. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the weaknesses outlined above.
