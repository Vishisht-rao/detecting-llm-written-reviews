## Review of "UNSUPERVISED REPRESENTATION LEARNING OF BRAIN ACTIVITY VIA BRIDGING VOXEL ACTIVITY AND FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY"

This paper proposes BRAIN MIXER, an unsupervised learning framework for learning voxel-level representations by jointly leveraging voxel activity and functional connectivity. The core idea is to use two MLP-based encoders, one for voxel activity and another for functional connectivity, and then pre-train them by maximizing their mutual information. The paper presents novel components like dynamic self-attention for voxel activity encoding and temporal graph patching with adaptive pooling for functional connectivity encoding. The empirical evaluation showcases superior performance against 14 baselines on several downstream tasks including anomaly detection and brain classification using six real-world datasets.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addressing an Important Gap:** The paper effectively identifies the limitations of existing methods that either focus on voxel-level activity or functional connectivity in isolation. Bridging this gap with a unified framework is a significant contribution.
*   **Novel Architecture:** The proposed BRAIN MIXER architecture incorporates several innovative components tailored for brain data. The dynamic self-attention mechanism and temporal graph patching with adaptive pooling demonstrate a good understanding of the data's characteristics. The use of functional patching based on brain functional systems is a clever idea.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The experimental results are compelling, consistently demonstrating superior performance against a wide range of baselines across various downstream tasks and datasets. The ablation study further validates the importance of each proposed component. The in-depth parameter sensitivity analysis and qualitative results provide further insights into the model's behavior.
*   **New Datasets:** The introduction of two new large-scale datasets based on THINGS (BVFC and BVFC-MEG) is valuable for the research community.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and clearly explains the proposed method and experimental setup. The inclusion of figures and tables effectively illustrates the architecture and results. The appendices are very helpful, providing more context to this paper.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Novelty of Components:** While the architecture has many components, the novelty of some components, especially MLP mixers, could be further emphasized. Even though there are significant changes (as detailed in Table 4), more direct comparisons and justification for design choices would be helpful.
*   **Limitations are too short:** The limitations section in Appendix G should be expanded. What are the specific real-world constraints when applying this model, particularly in clinical settings?
*   **Scope Limitations:** While addressing an important gap, the paper doesn't explicitly consider the potential for "out-of-scope detection." In real-world clinical applications, it's important to determine when the model is confident in its prediction and when it should flag a case as outside its training domain. This is closely related to reliability, as noted in Appendix G, but should be addressed in greater detail.
*   **Computational Cost:** With over 100 million parameters for larger datasets, it has a significant computational cost. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but should be addressed as a limitation.
*   **Some of the explanation should be moved to the main paper:** The paper would be stronger if some of the discussions that appear only in the supplementary material, such as F.2 on patching methods, were incorporated into the main paper. Similarly, a small description of each dataset would be nice to have in the main text.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand the Discussion on Patching and TPMIXER**: Emphasize novelty of functional patch. Clarify the motivation for these design choices with more details about the specific challenges and benefits.
*   **Expand the Limitations Section**: Provide more specific and practical limitations of the method. Include a discussion about "out-of-scope detection" considerations and potential future work.
*   **Consider incorporating some of the experimental results to the main text**: Add more context about how the data was gathered.
*   **Highlight generalizability** Add how easily this model can be applied to other brain imaging modalities (EEG, SEEG, etc.) in introduction.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective framework for unsupervised representation learning of brain activity. The strong empirical results, new datasets, and clear presentation make this paper a valuable contribution to the field. Addressing the identified weaknesses and incorporating the suggestions for improvement would further enhance the quality and impact of this work.

**Rating:** 8/10 (Strong Accept)
