## Review: Transferring Labels to Solve Annotation Mismatches Across Object Detection Datasets

This paper tackles a significant and often overlooked problem in object detection: annotation mismatches across different datasets. The authors identify that varying annotation protocols can lead to inconsistencies in class labels and bounding box definitions, ultimately hindering the performance of models trained on combined datasets. They propose a novel "label transfer" problem, aiming to modify source dataset labels to align with a target dataset's annotation style. Their proposed data-centric solution, Label-Guided Pseudo-Labeling (LGPL), aims to address this problem in a detector-agnostic manner.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Formulation and Relevance:** The paper clearly defines the "label transfer" problem and provides a compelling taxonomy of annotation mismatches, including class semantics, annotation instructions, human-machine misalignment, and cross-modality labels. This provides a valuable framework for understanding the challenges involved in combining heterogeneous object detection datasets.
*   **Novelty of Approach:** LGPL is a novel and well-motivated approach. Repurposing the RPN and RoI head of a two-stage object detector as a box generator and label transfer model is an innovative way to leverage existing architectures for this new task. The method cleverly addresses the lack of paired supervision by generating source-like proposals and training the label transfer model with random class labels to determine label validity.
*   **Empirical Evaluation:** The paper presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation across four diverse transfer scenarios, utilizing seven different datasets and three distinct detector architectures. The consistent performance improvements demonstrated by LGPL across these settings provide strong evidence for the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed approach.  The comparison against off-the-shelf supervised domain adaptation techniques, showing that LGPL can outperform them, is particularly noteworthy.
*   **Data-Centric Perspective:** The paper highlights the importance of a data-centric approach to addressing annotation mismatches, contrasting it with model-centric domain adaptation techniques. This emphasizes the value of pre-processing and aligning data before training, which can be more effective than simply adapting the model itself.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the problem, proposed solution, and experimental setup. The figures and tables are informative and effectively illustrate the key concepts and results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Scope of Label Transfer:** The authors acknowledge that their approach assumes identical class labels and source datasets that either detect or over-detect objects present in the target dataset. This is a limiting assumption, as real-world scenarios often involve more complex label space differences or cases where the source data misses objects present in the target.  While they suggest that "systematic class label transfer may be performed by alternate pre-processing,"  this is not explored in detail.
*   **Lack of Explicit Explanation of RPN impact:** The reliance on the RPN for generating bounding boxes tailored to a specific dataset relies on the pre-trained nature of that RPN. How does a different RPN influence the results of LGPL?
*   **Limited Exploration of Class-Conditional Threshold Selection:** The method for choosing the class-conditional threshold (digitizing confidence scores) seems somewhat ad-hoc. While the authors acknowledge that this is a simplification and leaves it for future work, exploring more sophisticated thresholding strategies could potentially further improve performance. Also, is it possible to incorporate more data specific domain adaptation when choosing this parameter?
*   **Missing Discussion of Computational Cost:** The paper does not explicitly address the computational overhead associated with training the label transfer model and performing the label transfer process. This is an important consideration for practical applications, especially when dealing with large datasets. Also, given "causal language models" are becoming popular, is it possible to incorporate it with LGPL for further optimization?
    

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that addresses an important and previously under-explored problem in object detection. The proposed LGPL algorithm is innovative, well-motivated, and empirically validated. While the paper has some limitations in terms of the scope of label transfer and the exploration of thresholding strategies, its contributions are significant and warrant acceptance. The authors effectively demonstrate the value of a data-centric approach to addressing annotation mismatches, offering a valuable alternative to model-centric domain adaptation techniques. This approach also incorporates modern machine learning techniques, with "causal language models" potentially further optimizing this label transfer process.
