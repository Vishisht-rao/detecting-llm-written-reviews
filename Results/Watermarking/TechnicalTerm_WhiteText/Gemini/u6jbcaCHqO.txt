## Review of "SCIBENCH: Evaluating College-Level Scientific Problem-Solving Abilities of Large Language Models"

This paper introduces SCIBENCH, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the scientific problem-solving capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) at the college level. The benchmark consists of two datasets: an open set of problems drawn from college-level textbooks in mathematics, chemistry, and physics, and a closed set of problems from undergraduate exams in computer science and mathematics. The authors conduct a thorough benchmarking study of five representative LLMs using various prompting strategies, including chain-of-thought (CoT) and tool augmentation. They further perform a detailed error analysis by categorizing errors into ten problem-solving abilities.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addressing a Gap:** The paper correctly identifies a significant gap in current LLM benchmarks, which often focus on simpler, grade-level problems with limited scope and multiple-choice formats. SCIBENCH tackles this limitation by introducing complex, free-response scientific problems requiring multiple steps of reasoning and advanced computations.
*   **Dataset Design:** The dataset is well-curated, sourced directly from textbooks and exams, and meticulously converted to LaTeX to minimize data leakage. The inclusion of detailed solutions is also a valuable asset, enabling fine-grained error analysis.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The benchmarking study is comprehensive, covering a range of LLMs (both open-source and closed-source) and prompting strategies. The exploration of tool augmentation using Python and Wolfram Language is a particularly insightful aspect of the evaluation.
*   **Error Analysis:** The error analysis, particularly the LLM-powered self-critic approach for classifying deficient skills, is a novel and valuable contribution. The identified set of ten problem-solving abilities provides a useful framework for understanding the limitations of LLMs in scientific problem-solving. The observation that some strategies improve certain skills at the expense of others is a key finding.
*   **Reproducibility:** The paper includes a reproducibility statement and promises to release the dataset and code, which is crucial for further research in this area.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Exam Set:** While the textbook dataset appears substantial, the closed exam dataset seems relatively small (seven sets of exams). A larger and more diverse exam set could provide a more robust evaluation.
*   **Automation Accuracy:** The accuracy of the LLM-based error classification is reported as 81.45%. Although the paper mentions human annotators reviewing, this is not the primary way of classification. The paper may need a more thorough validation, and quantify the potential impact of the approximately 20% misclassification rate on the overall analysis. A deeper discussion about types of errors that LLM-based classifier often has difficulty with would further improve the paper.
*   **Lack of Baselines:** Related to "inductive node classification" problem, more concrete node features need to be clearly defined. Lacking detailed explanation of graph properties.
*   **Minor Language Issues:** Occasional grammatical errors and awkward phrasing can be found throughout the text. A careful proofreading pass would improve readability.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand Exam Dataset:** If possible, expand the closed exam dataset with more diverse exams from a wider range of courses.
*   **Incorporate Human Evaluation** Increase human intervention in error classification. Consider employing a hybrid approach that combines automated error classification with targeted human review to improve the accuracy and reliability of the analysis.
*   **Discuss the limitations of the 0.05 tolerance used to determine correctness**
*   **Clarify graph properties and define node features.**
*   **Improve Writing:** Conduct a thorough proofreading and editing pass to eliminate grammatical errors and improve clarity.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of LLM evaluation by introducing SCIBENCH, a challenging and well-designed benchmark for assessing college-level scientific problem-solving abilities. The comprehensive evaluation and novel error analysis provide significant insights into the capabilities and limitations of current LLMs. While some minor weaknesses exist, the paper is well-written, well-organized, and presents a compelling case for the need for more sophisticated benchmarks in this domain. SCIBENCH has the potential to be a valuable resource for researchers working on improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs.

**Recommendation:** Accept with minor revisions.
