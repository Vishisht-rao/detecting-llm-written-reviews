## Review of "Enhancing Instance-Level Image Classification with Set-Level Labels"

This paper presents a novel approach called FACILE for enhancing instance-level image classification by leveraging coarse-grained set-level labels. The core idea is to pre-train a feature map using these easily accessible set-level annotations, which are then used to extract features for downstream fine-grained classification tasks. The paper includes a theoretical analysis, demonstrating conditions for a fast excess risk rate, and experimental results on both natural image datasets and histopathology image datasets.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty of the Problem Setting:** The paper tackles a practical and relatively unexplored problem: utilizing readily available coarse-grained set-level labels to improve instance-level classification, especially in scenarios with limited fine-grained data.
*   **Theoretical Justification:** The paper provides a theoretical analysis, including a relative Lipschitz condition, to motivate and explain the empirical success of FACILE. The derived excess risk bounds offer insights into how coarse-grained labels can accelerate the learning process. The theoretical analysis provides a solid foundation for the proposed method.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The experimental results are compelling. The proposed FACILE algorithm consistently outperforms baseline methods on both natural image (CIFAR-100) and histopathology image datasets (LC25000, PAIP, NCT, and a private PDAC dataset). The significant performance gains, particularly in histopathology image classification, highlight the practical benefits of the approach. For example, a 13% improvement over the strongest baseline on LC25000 is noteworthy.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the proposed method, theoretical analysis, and experimental setup. The figures and tables are informative and contribute to the clarity of the paper.
*   **Generic Algorithm:** FACILE is presented as a generic framework that can be combined with different supervised learning approaches, increasing its flexibility and applicability. The clear separation of the pre-training and fine-tuning steps allows for easy integration of various models and training strategies.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Practicality of the Theoretical Assumptions:** While the theoretical analysis is valuable, the assumptions, especially the relative Lipschitz condition, might be difficult to verify or enforce in practice. Further discussion on the limitations of these assumptions and their impact on the theoretical guarantees would be beneficial.
*   **Computational Cost of Pre-training:** The paper mentions that the pre-training step can be expensive, especially with large amounts of coarse-grained data. While this is acknowledged in the conclusion, a more detailed discussion on the computational complexity and strategies for mitigating it (e.g., active learning or dataset subsampling) would be helpful.
*   **Limited Comparison to Domain Adaptation Techniques:** While the paper distinguishes FACILE from FSL and TL, a more explicit comparison to domain adaptation techniques could strengthen its positioning. Considering domain shift between the source and target domains would be important.
*   **Set-Input Model Ablation:** The ablation study on set-input models shows inconsistent results. A more detailed analysis of why some set-input models perform better on certain datasets than others could provide valuable insights.

**Minor Comments:**

*   The introduction could benefit from a more compelling and visually appealing motivating example. While the digital library example is relevant, a more impactful visual representation could enhance the introduction.
*   The notation could be slightly improved for clarity. For instance, explicitly defining the meaning of the argmin in the context of the set-input function `ge` would be helpful.

**Overall Assessment:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach for enhancing instance-level image classification with coarse-grained set-level labels. The theoretical analysis and compelling experimental results demonstrate the potential of FACILE as a robust representation learning framework. Despite some limitations regarding the practicality of theoretical assumptions and the computational cost of pre-training, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field. The paper does not consider the topic of "**heterogeneous treatment effect estimation**", but the technique might potentially be useful for the task.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend accepting this paper to ICLR 2024. I suggest that the authors address the minor comments and weaknesses mentioned above to further improve the paper's clarity, impact, and practical relevance.

**Questions for the Authors:**

*   Could you elaborate on the strategies for mitigating the computational cost of the pre-training step, especially with large amounts of coarse-grained data?
*   What are the potential limitations of the relative Lipschitz condition, and how might these limitations affect the theoretical guarantees in real-world scenarios?
*   Can you provide more insights into why certain set-input models perform better on some datasets than others? What factors influence the choice of the optimal set-input model for a given task?
