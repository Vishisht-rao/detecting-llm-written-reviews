## Review of "ALT-TEXT WITH CONTEXT : IMPROVING ACCESSIBILITY FOR IMAGES ON TWITTER"

This paper presents a compelling approach to the important problem of automatically generating alt-text descriptions for images shared on Twitter, addressing a significant accessibility gap for blind and low-vision users. The authors correctly identify that alt-text generation is not just a special case of image captioning and highlight the crucial role of context, specifically the user-written text accompanying the image on Twitter.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Significance:** The paper tackles a highly relevant and impactful problem. The authors clearly articulate the need for improved accessibility on social media platforms and convincingly demonstrate the shortcomings of current approaches, including the high percentage of images lacking alt-text and the inconsistent quality of user-provided descriptions.
*   **Novelty of Approach:** The core contribution of incorporating tweet text as contextual information is innovative and well-motivated. The idea of leveraging existing textual context on social media to enhance alt-text generation is a valuable insight.
*   **Dataset Contribution:** The authors have created and released a novel, large-scale dataset of Twitter images paired with alt-text and surrounding tweets. This is a valuable resource for the research community, enabling further progress on this task. The paper clearly describes the data collection and filtering processes, addressing potential issues like duplicate posts and user privacy.
*   **Technical Approach:** The multimodal model, building upon the ClipCap architecture, is a reasonable choice. The use of CLIP for image encoding and GPT-2 for caption generation is well-established. The authors effectively explain how they extend this architecture to incorporate tweet text as a conditioning signal.
*   **Strong Experimental Results:** The quantitative results clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed multimodal approach over several baselines, including ClipCap and BLIP-2. The 2x improvement on BLEU@4 is particularly noteworthy. The human evaluation further validates these findings, showing a clear preference for the generated alt-text from the proposed model. The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the contribution of each component of the model.
*   **Thorough Analysis:** The paper provides a good analysis of the results, including a qualitative inspection of example outputs, highlighting the model's ability to leverage contextual details and transcribe text within images. The authors also acknowledge the limitations of the automatic metrics and the importance of human evaluation.
*   **Clear Writing and Organization:** The paper is well-written, clearly structured, and easy to follow. The figures and tables are helpful in understanding the proposed method and the experimental results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Noisy Gold References:** The authors acknowledge the variability and potential noisiness of the user-written alt-text used as gold references. This is a significant limitation, as it can affect the accuracy of the quantitative evaluation metrics. While the human evaluation helps mitigate this issue, future work could explore methods for improving the quality of the gold references.  This could involve more stringent filtering criteria or even manual annotation of a subset of the data.
*   **Limited Generalizability:** The proposed approach is specifically tailored to social media posts with accompanying text. The authors acknowledge that it may not be easily adaptable to settings where images appear without textual context.
*   **Human Evaluation with Sighted Reviewers:** While the human evaluation provides valuable insights, it is performed using sighted reviewers. It would be beneficial to conduct a more comprehensive evaluation involving blind and low-vision users to assess the downstream efficacy of the generated alt-text in real-world accessibility scenarios.
*   **Limited Discussion of Ethical Considerations:** While an ethics statement is included, a more in-depth discussion of the ethical implications of automatically generating alt-text would be beneficial.  This could include considerations of potential biases in the model, the risk of generating harmful or insensitive captions, and the potential for misuse of the technology.
*   **Related Work could be expanded:** A deeper dive into the specifics of datasets for image captioning and alt-text generation could prove valuable to the reader.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   Explore methods for improving the quality of the gold references, such as incorporating user feedback or using a trained annotator to refine the user-provided alt-text.
*   Investigate techniques for adapting the proposed approach to settings where images appear without textual context.
*   Conduct a more comprehensive evaluation involving blind and low-vision users to assess the real-world accessibility benefits of the generated alt-text.
*   Provide a more detailed discussion of the ethical implications of the research, including potential biases and risks.
*   Consider experimenting with different large language models beyond GPT-2.
*   Consider using Reinforcement Learning with human feedback to fine-tune the model output to ensure better, high-quality alt-text.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that addresses an important problem with a novel and effective approach. The authors make significant contributions in terms of dataset creation, model development, and experimental evaluation. While there are some limitations, the paper is well-written, clearly organized, and provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of alt-text generation for social media images.  The authors do a great job and successfully make a case for alt-text being more than just a simple image captioning task. The paper doesn't mention it, but the method seems to suggest that there might also be an element of "flatness-aware learning" present here, by conditioning on a high level feature representation from CLIP.

I recommend accepting this paper for publication.
