## Review of "ANTGPT: Can Large Language Models Help Long-Term Action Anticipation from Videos?"

This paper presents AntGPT, a framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for long-term action anticipation (LTA) in videos. The authors tackle LTA from both a bottom-up (temporal dynamics modeling) and a top-down (goal inference and procedure planning) perspective. They hypothesize, and subsequently demonstrate, that LLMs pre-trained on procedural text data can provide valuable prior knowledge for both approaches. AntGPT represents video observations as sequences of human actions, allowing the LLM to infer goals and model temporal dynamics. The paper reports state-of-the-art results on several LTA benchmarks (Ego4D LTA v1 and v2, EPIC-Kitchens-55, EGTEA GAZE+) and demonstrates the possibility of distilling the LLM's knowledge into a compact neural network for efficient inference.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The core idea of leveraging LLMs for LTA is novel and promising. Bridging the gap between computer vision and NLP in this manner offers a fresh perspective on a challenging task. The task is practically relevant for human-machine interaction.
*   **Clear Problem Formulation and Research Questions:** The paper clearly defines the LTA task and outlines four specific research questions, providing a strong focus for the research.
*   **Well-Defined Methodology:** AntGPT's architecture and training process are well-described, including the action-based video representation, in-context learning for goal inference, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for temporal dynamics modeling. The knowledge distillation approach is also clearly explained.
*   **Comprehensive Experiments and Results:** The paper includes extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of AntGPT. The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the contributions of different components of the framework. The comparison with state-of-the-art methods convincingly shows the superiority of AntGPT. The qualitative analysis with counterfactual predictions sheds light on the model's reasoning process.
*   **Practical Implications:** The ability to distill the LLM's knowledge into a compact model highlights the potential for practical deployment of AntGPT in resource-constrained environments.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the authors' line of reasoning. The figures are helpful in visualizing the AntGPT framework.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Reliance on Noisy Action Recognition:** The video representation relies on action recognition models, which can be noisy. While the authors acknowledge this and show that the LLM is robust to some noise, the performance of AntGPT is ultimately limited by the accuracy of the action recognition module. Further exploration of more robust visual representations might be beneficial.
*   **Goal Inference Limitations:** Although in-context learning is used for goal inference, the manual annotation of goals for some datasets and the use of video metadata as "pseudo goals" introduce a degree of subjectivity and may not fully capture the true underlying goals. More sophisticated methods for goal inference, potentially leveraging unsupervised techniques or external knowledge bases, could be explored. The analysis about the 'counterfactual' changes due to goal changes are thought provoking but only qualitative. Quantitative confirmation of the same may have strengthened the results and analysis.
*   **Limited Exploration of Prompt Engineering:** While in-context learning is utilized, the paper doesn't deeply explore the impact of different prompt designs and example selection strategies on the performance of goal inference and action anticipation. A more thorough investigation of prompt engineering could further improve the results.
*   **Lack of Theoretical Justification:** The paper lacks in-depth theoretical analysis. While the empirical results are strong, providing a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of LLMs in LTA, such as linking to the properties of pre-training data or the structure of the language model, would further strengthen the contribution. The paper doesn't discuss the potential effect of "deep learning theory; large learning rate; oscillation of stochastic gradient descent;" on LLM based method.
*   **Limited negative results and analysis:** While the qualitative error analysis through examples are helpful, the paper could have improved by showcasing more failure cases and analysis what may have caused those failures.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Investigate more robust video representations:** Explore alternative video representations that are less susceptible to noise in action recognition. This could involve using visual embeddings directly or incorporating object detection and scene understanding information.
*   **Develop more sophisticated goal inference methods:** Investigate unsupervised or weakly-supervised methods for learning goal representations directly from video data. Explore the use of external knowledge bases or commonsense reasoning to improve the accuracy and interpretability of goal inference. Consider using attention mechanisms to better highlight those portions of the input that are most relevant for goal prediction.
*   **Conduct a thorough prompt engineering study:** Systematically evaluate the impact of different prompt designs and example selection strategies on the performance of AntGPT. Explore the use of automated prompt optimization techniques.
*   **Provide a theoretical justification:** Attempt to provide a theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of LLMs in LTA. This could involve linking to the properties of pre-training data, the structure of the language model, or the cognitive science literature on action grammars.
*   **Add Discussion of Computational Cost:** The paper mentions distilling the LLM into a compact neural network for inference. Discussion about the computational cost during training would be helpful. How long does the finetuning process take and what are the system requirements?
*   **More Analysis for Error Examples:** More examples of the failure cases and detailed analysis of the causes of error.

**Overall Assessment:**

Despite the minor weaknesses, this is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach to long-term action anticipation. The use of LLMs for goal inference and temporal dynamics modeling is a promising direction for future research. The paper is well-written, the experiments are comprehensive, and the results are convincing. I recommend accepting this paper for publication at ICLR 2024.
