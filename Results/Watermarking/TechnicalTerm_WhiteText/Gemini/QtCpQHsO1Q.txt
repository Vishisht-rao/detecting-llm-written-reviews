## Review of "ALLEVIATING LABEL SHIFT THROUGH SELF-TRAINED INTERMEDIATE DISTRIBUTION: THEORY AND ALGORITHMS"

This paper proposes a novel approach, ALS, to address the label shift problem by introducing and learning an intermediate distribution between the source and target domains. The core idea is to reduce the distribution discrepancy by constructing a self-trained intermediate distribution using labeled source and unlabeled target samples. The approach incorporates confidence-guided pseudo-labeling and alignment of label conditional distributions using Kernel Mean Matching. The paper provides theoretical justification in the form of generalization bounds and presents empirical results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, demonstrating improved performance over existing methods like BBSE and RLLS.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Idea:** Introducing an intermediate distribution to alleviate label shift is a compelling and intuitive approach. The motivation behind reducing the distribution distance gradually instead of directly bridging the gap is well-explained.
*   **Theoretical Justification:** The paper provides theoretical guarantees for the proposed method, including sample complexity and generalization bounds. The derivation of Proposition 7, which balances pseudo-label bias and importance weighting variance, is a key contribution. The paper also provides propositions for its assumptions, e.g. proposition 1 is for an intermediate distribution to satisfy a linear combination of source and target domain distributions.
*   **Comprehensive Empirical Evaluation:** The paper presents a thorough experimental evaluation, comparing ALS with several baselines on various datasets and shift types. The ablation studies analyzing the impact of pseudo-label ratios and base classifiers are particularly valuable.
*   **Clear and Well-Structured:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The problem setting, proposed approach, and experimental results are clearly presented.
*   **Extensibility:**  The authors note the ALS framework can be extended to other label shift methods without theoretical guarantee. The ability to extend ALS to other methods also highlights the strong potential of the proposed methods

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Lack of Discussion on Computational Cost:** While the additional experiments show that ALS is of reasonable runtime, the overall time cost needs to be considered and further compared to similar methods in other label shift settings. Is the performance increase of ALS over other label shift settings worth the increase in computational cost?
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The paper acknowledges the sensitivity of the trade-off parameter β. While the sensitivity analysis in the appendix provides some guidance, a more robust and adaptive approach to setting this parameter would be beneficial. Can we further tune the hyperparameters adaptively or do we rely on validation sets to properly evaluate the parameters?
*   **"Conformal risk control" is absent:** The paper would benefit from exploring connections to "conformal risk control" methods, which provide distribution-free guarantees on the performance of machine learning models under distribution shift. While the current theoretical analysis provides generalization bounds, exploring links to "conformal risk control" could offer additional insights and potential benefits.
*   **Missing Discussion on Generalized Label Shift:** The paper briefly mentions the potential extension to generalized label shift in the conclusion. However, a more detailed discussion of the challenges and potential solutions for addressing conditional distribution alignment under generalized label shift would strengthen the paper.
*   **Kernel Selection and Tuning:** While the paper mentions using a Gaussian kernel for KMM, the choice of kernel and the bandwidth parameter σ are not thoroughly discussed. A sensitivity analysis of these parameters and a justification for the choice of Gaussian kernel would be valuable.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Add a section on computational cost and runtime analysis**, focusing on the main time consuming steps and ways to reduce the computational cost.
*   **Investigate adaptive methods for setting the parameter** β or provide more detailed guidance on hyperparameter tuning.
*   **Incorporate a discussion on the relationship between ALS and "conformal risk control"**, highlighting potential benefits and limitations of each approach.
*   **Expand the discussion on generalized label shift**, outlining the challenges of conditional distribution alignment and potential solutions for adapting ALS to this setting.
*   **Provide a more thorough justification for the choice of Gaussian kernel** and present a sensitivity analysis of the bandwidth parameter σ.
*   **Clearly state the assumptions under Proposition 7**, the theoretical guarantee may not be applicable in practical cases if the assumptions are not well justified.
*   **Mention the limitations of your methods** as well as its contributions in the introduction.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a promising approach to address the label shift problem. The introduction of an intermediate distribution and the self-training mechanism are novel and well-motivated. The theoretical justification and empirical results provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed method. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact. I recommend accepting this paper, contingent on addressing the aforementioned suggestions.
