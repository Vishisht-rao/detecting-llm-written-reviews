## Review of "COLIDE: C ONCOMITANT LINEAR DAG E STIMATION"

This paper addresses the challenging problem of learning Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structures from observational data generated by linear Structural Equation Models (SEMs). The authors identify limitations in existing regression-based methods, particularly the reliance on homoscedasticity assumptions and the sensitivity of lasso-type regularization to unknown noise variances. To address these issues, they propose a novel convex score function, CoLiDE (Concomitant Linear DAG Estimation), which incorporates concomitant estimation of scale parameters alongside DAG topology inference.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The core contribution is the application of concomitant scale estimation techniques from sparse linear regression to the DAG learning problem. This is a relatively unexplored area, and the paper effectively demonstrates its potential. The authors highlight that, "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that ideas from concomitant scale estimation permeate benefits to DAG learning".
*   **Theoretical Foundation:** The authors provide a clear exposition of the proposed convex score function, along with justifications based on existing literature on scaled lasso and robust regression. The convexity arguments for the proposed score function are compelling.
*   **Algorithmic Clarity:** The CoLiDE algorithm is presented with sufficient detail, including optimization considerations like the use of block coordinate descent and early stopping. The pseudocode in Algorithm 1 is also helpful for understanding the implementation.
*   **Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation:** The paper includes extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The experiments cover various graph types (Erdos-Renyi, Scale-Free), noise distributions (Gaussian, Exponential, Laplace), and noise profiles (homoscedastic, heteroscedastic). The comparisons against state-of-the-art methods are thorough.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** CoLiDE consistently outperforms other methods, especially in larger DAGs and heteroscedastic noise settings. The improvement in DAG recovery performance, measured by metrics like SHD, SID, TPR, and FDR, is significant.  The empirical results also demonstrate CoLiDE's enhanced stability, as manifested in reduced standard deviations. The noise estimation accuracy of CoLiDE is also compelling and shows a clear advantage over benchmarked approaches.
*   **Real-world Applicability:**  The successful application of CoLiDE to the Sachs dataset further validates its practical relevance.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors provide a clear reproducibility statement and have made their code publicly available.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Scope:** The current formulation is restricted to linear SEMs and observational data. While the authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest potential extensions, the current scope limits the applicability of the method to a broader class of causal discovery problems.
*   **Limited Discussion of Identifiability:** While the authors mention the non-identifiability of DAG structures in heteroscedastic settings (citing Peters et al., 2017), the implications of this are not discussed as deeply as they could be. How does CoLiDE specifically address or circumvent the challenges posed by non-identifiability?  The discussion on quasi-equivalence could be more intuitive.
*   **Limited Connection to "3d molecules":** The paper doesn't seem to mention anything related to "3d molecules". This may need to be added in future revisions if that direction is interesting for the research.

**Questions and Suggestions:**

*   The authors mention the potential for using other convex loss functions (e.g., Huber's loss) and nonlinear SEMs. Are there specific challenges or design considerations that arise when extending CoLiDE to these settings?
*   In the heteroscedastic setting, what factors influence the performance difference between CoLiDE-EV and CoLiDE-NV? Are there guidelines for choosing between the two variants based on the characteristics of the data?
*   The paper mentions future work on online optimization methods. Are there specific challenges in adapting the concomitant scale estimation approach to online settings? How would the lower bound parameters (σ0, Σ0) be updated in an online manner?
*   The authors state "LS-based linear DAG learning approaches are prone to introducing cycles in the estimated graph." What is the intuition behind why CoLiDE mitigates this when compared to standard methods?

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of DAG learning. The proposed CoLiDE method is well-motivated, theoretically sound, and empirically validated. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, despite the technical nature of the subject matter. The authors have addressed a key limitation in existing methods and have provided a promising new approach for learning DAG structures from observational data. The claim is made that this is the first time ideas from concomitant scale estimation are explored for DAG learning, however the paper does not explore or mention the connection between causal discovery and "3d molecules", limiting the paper's scope.  I recommend acceptance.
