## Review of "Quality Diversity through Human Feedback"

This paper introduces Quality Diversity through Human Feedback (QDHF), a novel approach that integrates human feedback into Quality Diversity (QD) algorithms to dynamically infer diversity metrics. The core idea is to learn a latent space projection from human judgments of similarity among solutions, enabling QD algorithms to be applied in tasks where diversity metrics are difficult to hand-engineer. The paper presents promising results in robotics, reinforcement learning, and image generation, demonstrating QDHF's ability to outperform unsupervised diversity discovery methods and match the efficacy of manually crafted metrics.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Idea:** The integration of human feedback into QD to learn diversity metrics is a significant contribution. It addresses a key limitation of traditional QD algorithms, which rely on often-difficult-to-define, manual diversity measures. This makes QD applicable to a wider range of complex, open-ended tasks.
*   **Clear Problem Statement:** The paper clearly articulates the problem of manually defined diversity metrics in QD and motivates the need for a more adaptable approach. The research questions are well-defined and the proposed solution, QDHF, directly addresses them.
*   **Solid Methodology:** The proposed QDHF framework, based on latent space projection and contrastive learning, is well-reasoned and technically sound. The use of contrastive learning to align the learned diversity metrics with human preferences is a clever and effective approach. The distinction between offline and online training strategies provides flexibility for different application scenarios.
*   **Comprehensive Experiments:** The experimental evaluation is thorough and covers diverse domains, including robotics, RL, and image generation. The comparison with strong baselines, including AURORA and standard QD with ground truth metrics, provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of QDHF. The user study in the latent space illumination task further strengthens the findings. The ablation studies and analysis on scalability are valuable.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the key ideas and results. The introduction clearly sets the context and motivations for the work.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Simulated Human Feedback:** While the use of simulated human feedback in the robotic arm and maze navigation tasks allows for controlled comparisons, it raises concerns about the generalizability of the results to real-world scenarios with noisy or inconsistent human judgments. Although, the paper does have the experiment on latent space illumination (LSI) task, where human feedback is considered and leveraged in their experiment.
*   **Lack of Theoretical Justification:** The paper lacks a theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of QDHF. It would be beneficial to provide some theoretical guarantees or insights into the behavior of the algorithm under different conditions. Although the paper provides the experimental results by varying hyper-parameters, it is hard to directly come to a conclusion to what makes the alogirthm work effectively.
*   **Preference Model Reliance:** In the LSI experiment, the reliance on the DreamSim preference model introduces a potential bias. The performance of QDHF is dependent on the accuracy and representativeness of the preference model. The paper acknowledges this but doesn't fully explore the sensitivity of the results to the choice of preference model.
*   **Scalability Details:** While the analysis touches upon scalability, further details about the computational cost of QDHF, particularly the contrastive learning component, would be beneficial. How does the training time scale with the size of the solution archive and the number of human judgments?

**Minor Comments:**

*   The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach. What types of diversity are difficult for QDHF to capture? Are there specific scenarios where QDHF is likely to fail?
*   The connection to existing literature on active learning could be strengthened. The online training strategy can be seen as a form of active learning, and drawing connections to this literature could provide additional insights.
*   The use of the term "latent space illumination" is a bit opaque. While the paper does provide a definition, it could be made more accessible to readers unfamiliar with this terminology.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and promising approach to addressing a key limitation of Quality Diversity algorithms. The experimental results are compelling and the paper is generally well-written. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper. While the paper does not directly mention any convergence results, it might be helpful to think about whether "contraction lemma" based approaches could provide additional theoretical insights into the learning dynamics of the diversity metrics.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend accepting this paper with minor revisions. The authors should address the weaknesses outlined above to improve the clarity, robustness, and generalizability of the work.
