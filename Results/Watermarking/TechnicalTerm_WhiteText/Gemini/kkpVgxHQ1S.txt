## Review of "Latent Diffusion Counterfactual Explanations"

This paper introduces Latent Diffusion Counterfactual Explanations (LDCE), a novel approach for generating counterfactual explanations for black-box classifiers, particularly in image domains. The core idea is to leverage class- or text-conditional foundation latent diffusion models, coupled with a new consensus guidance mechanism, to produce semantically meaningful and high-quality visual counterfactuals. The paper addresses a significant limitation of existing counterfactual generation methods, which often rely on adversarial gradients that can lead to unrealistic artifacts or require computationally intensive guidance schemes or auxiliary models. LDCE overcomes these limitations by operating in the latent space of a pre-trained autoencoder and by filtering out noisy, adversarial gradients using a consensus mechanism based on the diffusion model's implicit classifier.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The proposed LDCE approach presents a significant advance in counterfactual explanation generation. The combination of latent diffusion models with the consensus guidance mechanism is both innovative and effective in producing realistic and semantically meaningful counterfactuals. The paper correctly identifies and addresses shortcomings in previous approaches, such as SVCE, DVCE, and DiME/ACE.
*   **Model- and Dataset-Agnostic:** One of the most compelling strengths of LDCE is its versatility. The paper convincingly demonstrates its applicability across a wide range of models (CNNs, transformers), datasets (ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, Oxford Pets/Flowers), and learning paradigms (supervised, self-supervised). This dataset-agnostic property, enabled by the foundational nature of the underlying diffusion model, is a key differentiator and a valuable contribution, making it more applicable than methods relying on specific training data. The paper correctly states that their method is the first that is model- and dataset-agnostic in that regard.
*   **Computational Efficiency:** LDCE achieves significant speed-ups compared to methods like DiME and ACE, which require expensive backpropagation through the diffusion process. This makes LDCE more practical for real-world applications.
*   **Qualitative Results:** The paper presents a rich set of qualitative examples that visually demonstrate the effectiveness of LDCE in generating plausible and informative counterfactuals. The examples clearly show the ability of LDCE to introduce both local and global semantic changes, while minimizing artifacts and adversarial perturbations. Figures 1, 3, and 4 are particularly effective in showcasing the method's capabilities.
*   **Quantitative Evaluation:** The quantitative evaluation provides strong evidence to support the claims made in the paper. LDCE achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing methods in terms of validity (Flip Ratio), realism (FID, sFID), and other relevant metrics.
*   **Error Analysis:** The paper goes beyond simply generating counterfactuals and demonstrates their utility in identifying and understanding model errors. The case studies involving ResNet-50 misclassifications provide valuable insights into the model's decision-making process.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The technical details of the LDCE approach are clearly explained, and the experimental setup is well-defined. Algorithm 1 provides a concise overview of the method. The background section provides sufficient overview of the related work to better understand and appreciate the introduced novel method.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The paper acknowledges the need for hyperparameter optimization, which can be time-consuming and require some expertise. It would be beneficial to provide more guidance on how to select appropriate hyperparameters for different datasets and models or suggest a method for automating the hyperparameter search.
*   **Runtime Performance:** While the paper reports improvements in computational efficiency compared to some previous methods, counterfactual generation speed might still be a limitation. As the authors suggest, runtime could be further enhanced with techniques that are used to distill diffusion models or other speed-up techniques. This is essential for real-time or interactive applications.
*   **Failure Cases:** While the paper mentions and demonstrates failure cases (blurriness, distortions, large distance to yCF), the discussion could be expanded. Analyzing the root causes of these failures and exploring potential mitigation strategies would further strengthen the paper. While these limitations are likely inherited from the foundation diffusion model, these should still be acknowledged and discussed.

**Minor Comments:**

*   In Equation (1), it might be better to define x' as belonging to the domain X, i.e.,  x' âˆˆ X.
*   In Equation (7), it should be made more clear that the conditional diffusion model rxlogp(x|c) is trained with conditioning dropout.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of explainable AI. The proposed LDCE approach is novel, versatile, computationally efficient, and generates high-quality visual counterfactual explanations. The paper is well-written, technically sound, and supported by thorough experimental results. The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the related work and effectively address the limitations of existing approaches. Furthermore, the analysis of failure modes and the demonstration of error analysis using counterfactuals are appreciated.

The authors use of latent diffusion models could be considered an implicit "inversion" process for the actual input before generating the counterfactual explanation.

I recommend this paper for acceptance.
