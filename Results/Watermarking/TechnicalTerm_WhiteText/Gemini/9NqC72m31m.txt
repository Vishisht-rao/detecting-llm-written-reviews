## Review of "Neural Field Classifiers via Target Encoding and Classification Loss"

This paper tackles a fundamental and largely overlooked question in the field of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and other neural field methods: are regression formulations inherently better than classification formulations? The authors propose a novel Neural Field Classifier (NFC) framework that converts existing Neural Field Regressors (NFRs) into classifiers via a "Target Encoding" module and optimization with a classification loss.

**Strengths:**

* **Novelty and Significance:** The core idea of reframing neural fields as classification problems is novel and presents a potentially impactful shift in how these methods are designed and optimized.  The paper directly addresses a key assumption underlying much of the existing literature.
* **Clarity of Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and explains the proposed NFC framework clearly. The illustrations (Figure 1 and 2) effectively visualize the differences between NFRs and NFCs, and the Target Encoding process.  The ablation study provides insight into the contributions of the Target Encoding and classification loss components.
* **Empirical Validation:** The extensive experiments across various datasets (Replica, Tanks & Temples, dynamic scenes) and neural field architectures (DVGO, NeRF, D-NeRF, NeuS) provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed NFC framework. The results consistently show significant improvements in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS when using the NFC approach.  The experiments on sparse inputs and corrupted images further highlight the robustness of NFC.
* **Simplicity and Efficiency:** The implementation of NFC appears to be relatively straightforward, requiring only modifications to the final layer and the loss function.  The paper claims "nearly free extra computational costs," which is supported by the reported training and rendering times.
* **Robustness and Generalization:** The analysis of the hyperparameter Î» reveals that NFC is robust to a wide range of values, making it easier to deploy in practice. The learning curves suggest that the performance gain of NFC is primarily due to improved generalization.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited Discussion of "Normal Mode Analysis":** The paper's discussion of generalization is somewhat superficial.  While the authors mention flatter minima, they don't delve deeper into the underlying mechanisms that contribute to improved generalization. They fail to reference related concepts such as "normal mode analysis", a powerful tool to study the loss landscape and understand the origins of the observed generalization boost. A more thorough discussion of the connection between the proposed method and the loss landscape's properties would strengthen the theoretical underpinnings of the work.
* **Limited Improvements in Some Scenarios:** The paper acknowledges that the improvements offered by NFC are limited when the task is simple or when the NFR already has strong view generalization. While this is an honest assessment, a deeper investigation into *why* this occurs would be valuable. What characteristics of these scenarios render the classification approach less effective?
* **Lack of Theoretical Analysis:**  While the empirical results are compelling, the paper lacks a formal theoretical analysis of the proposed method.  Why does target encoding and classification loss lead to better performance?  A theoretical framework could provide a more robust understanding of the benefits and limitations of NFC.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Expand the Discussion of Generalization:**  Incorporate a more thorough discussion of the relationship between NFC and the loss landscape. Investigate if "normal mode analysis" can provide insights into the improved generalization of NFC.
* **Investigate Limitations Further:** Explore the reasons why NFC provides less improvement in simple scenarios.  Identify the characteristics of tasks where NFC is most effective.
* **Consider a Theoretical Analysis:** Develop a theoretical framework that explains the benefits of the proposed method.
* **Address Potential Gradient Issues:**  While the paper mentions potential gradient explosion issues and introduces a fix, it would be beneficial to provide a more detailed explanation of why these issues arise and how the proposed solution effectively mitigates them.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and potentially impactful contribution to the field of neural fields. The empirical results are compelling, and the paper is generally well-written. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above, particularly a deeper dive into generalization and the loss landscape, would further strengthen the paper. I recommend acceptance.
