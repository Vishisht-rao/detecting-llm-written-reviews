## Review of "Co-learning Empirical Games & World Models"

This paper explores the potential benefits of co-learning a world model and an empirical game for game-based decision-making. The central idea is that these two models, which are typically learned and used separately, can mutually enhance each other. Empirical games can provide strategically diverse data to improve world model training, while world models can facilitate more efficient strategy discovery through planning, thereby reducing the computational cost associated with building empirical games. The authors introduce Dyna-PSRO, a new algorithm that implements this co-learning approach, and demonstrate its effectiveness in partially observable general-sum games compared to the PSRO baseline.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The paper tackles an important and relevant problem in multi-agent reinforcement learning. The idea of co-learning world models and empirical games is innovative and offers a promising approach to improve performance and sample efficiency in complex games. The authors clearly articulate the potential advantages of this approach and provide empirical evidence to support their claims.
*   **Clarity and Structure:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The introduction clearly motivates the research question and provides a concise overview of the proposed solution. The related work section provides a comprehensive overview of relevant literature in empirical game theory, model-based reinforcement learning, and multi-agent reinforcement learning. The experimental setup is well-described, and the results are presented clearly and concisely.
*   **Thorough Empirical Evaluation:** The paper presents a series of experiments that independently verify the benefits of strategic diversity for world model training and the use of world models for response calculation. The experiments are well-designed and provide convincing evidence to support the authors' claims. The evaluation of Dyna-PSRO against PSRO on multiple games demonstrates the practical effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
*   **Dyna-PSRO Algorithm:** The description of Dyna-PSRO is clear, and the two key modifications to the PSRO algorithm are well-defined. The integration of a Dyna-based reinforcement learner with simultaneous planning, learning, and acting is a valuable contribution.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Lack of theoretical analysis:** The paper primarily focuses on empirical results. It would be beneficial to include some theoretical analysis to provide a deeper understanding of the convergence properties of Dyna-PSRO and the conditions under which co-learning is most effective. For example, providing theoretical bounds on the sample complexity or regret of Dyna-PSRO compared to PSRO could strengthen the paper.
*   **Limited discussion of limitations:** While the conclusion acknowledges some limitations, a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the approach and potential areas for future research would be helpful. For instance, the paper does not explicitly discuss how Dyna-PSRO would perform in situations with very high state or action spaces, or the sensitivity of the algorithm to the accuracy of the world model. The "connectivity structure" is not discussed with respect to the agent interactions or game environment.
*   **World Model Complexity:** The world models used in the experiments are computationally costly to query, as they function directly on agent observations. While the authors acknowledge this limitation, further discussion on potential solutions, such as using latent world models, would be valuable.
*   **Deviation Set:** The paper states that the deviation set is a union of the policies from each method. How does that selection impact the SumRegret measurement?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   Include a section on theoretical analysis to provide a deeper understanding of the algorithm's convergence properties and sample complexity.
*   Expand the discussion of limitations to include potential challenges in high-dimensional state and action spaces, sensitivity to world model accuracy, and scalability to a large number of players. Discuss the impact of the deviation set selection on the SumRegret measurement.
*   Explore alternative world model architectures, such as latent world models, to reduce computational costs and improve scalability.
*   Consider adding a visualization of the learned world model to provide more insights into its internal representations and how it captures the game dynamics.
*   Investigate the performance of Dyna-PSRO on a wider range of games, including those with different interaction protocols and a larger number of players.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of multi-agent reinforcement learning. The idea of co-learning world models and empirical games is promising, and the Dyna-PSRO algorithm offers a practical approach to implement this co-learning strategy. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in improving performance and sample efficiency. While the paper could be strengthened by including some theoretical analysis and a more detailed discussion of limitations, it is a well-written and well-executed study that is worthy of publication at ICLR 2024.
