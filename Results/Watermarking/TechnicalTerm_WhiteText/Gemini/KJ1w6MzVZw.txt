## Review of "LARGE PRE-TRAINED TIME SERIES MODELS FOR CROSS-DOMAIN TIME SERIES ANALYSIS TASKS"

This paper presents LPTM, a novel approach to pre-training large time-series models across diverse domains. The core idea revolves around adaptive segmentation of time-series data, aiming to provide semantically meaningful inputs to a transformer-based architecture. The paper argues that existing time-series models often struggle to leverage data from different domains and require significant task-specific training data. LPTM addresses this by learning a segmentation strategy tailored to each domain, based on self-supervised learning losses. The authors demonstrate that LPTM achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art domain-specific models on a variety of forecasting and classification tasks, while also being more data and compute-efficient.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The adaptive segmentation module is a novel contribution and a sensible approach to the challenge of pre-training on heterogeneous time-series datasets. The idea of learning segmentation strategies specific to each domain based on SSL loss is well-motivated and potentially impactful.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper provides a thorough evaluation of LPTM across a wide range of forecasting and classification tasks, demonstrating its versatility and generalizability. The benchmarks cover diverse domains like epidemiology, energy, traffic, economics, and behavioral datasets.
*   **Data Efficiency:** The experiments on data efficiency are particularly compelling. The results clearly show that LPTM requires significantly less task-specific training data compared to the baselines, highlighting the benefits of pre-training.
*   **Training Efficiency:** The paper demonstrates that LPTM can be fine-tuned to downstream tasks with significantly less training time compared to baselines, demonstrating the practical benefits of pre-training.
*   **Clear Writing (Mostly):** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, with a clear explanation of the proposed method and experimental setup.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Technical Details of Segmentation Module:** While the concept of the segmentation module is clear, some technical details could be elaborated upon. For example, the process of optimizing the segment score function (Equation 4) and the reasons for backpropagating only every 10 batches could be explained in more detail. The hyperparameter sensitivity of the segmentation strategy is not addressed.
*   **Justification of SSL Tasks:** The choice of Random Masking and Last Token Masking is motivated by prior work in language modeling. While this is reasonable, a deeper justification in the context of time-series data would be beneficial. Why are these specific tasks effective for learning representations in time-series? Could other SSL tasks be more effective?
*   **Ablation Study Clarity:** While the ablation study provides insights into the contribution of different components, the results for "LPTM-NoPreTrain" are somewhat puzzling. It's expected to underperform significantly, but sometimes it shows relatively competitive results, suggesting there might be some issues with how this ablation is conducted or interpreted.
*   **Missing Related Work:** The paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion of related work in time-series representation learning, particularly methods that address the challenge of heterogeneity. While the paper mentions TS2Vec and TS-TCC, it should contextualize them more thoroughly and discuss other relevant approaches.
*   **Clarity of "Instance Normalization" section:** The section on Instance Normalization does not clearly explain why Reversible Instance Normalization (REVIN) is superior to standard Instance Normalization or other normalization techniques for time-series pre-training.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand on Segmentation Module Details:** Provide more details about the implementation and optimization of the segmentation module, including hyperparameters and sensitivity analysis.
*   **Provide Deeper Justification for SSL Tasks:** Explain why Random Masking and Last Token Masking are well-suited for time-series pre-training and discuss potential alternatives.
*   **Clarify Ablation Study Results:** Investigate and explain the relatively strong performance of "LPTM-NoPreTrain" in some cases.
*   **Expand Related Work Discussion:** Include a more comprehensive discussion of related work in time-series representation learning and heterogeneity, particularly recent advances in contrastive learning for time-series.
*   **Justify Choice of REVIN:** Provide a stronger justification for using Reversible Instance Normalization over other normalization techniques.
*   **Discuss Limitations:** The paper should explicitly discuss the limitations of LPTM, such as its computational cost, the potential sensitivity to hyperparameter settings, and the types of time-series data where it might not perform well.
*   **Address catastrophic forgetting:** Pre-trained models can suffer from catastrophic forgetting. Has the paper considered strategies to mitigate this, like regularization techniques or replay buffers?

**Missing Concepts:**

The paper does not mention "bundle adjustment", a technique commonly used in computer vision and other fields to refine estimates of parameters by simultaneously optimizing over a large set of related measurements. While "bundle adjustment" might not be directly applicable to the current method, discussing its potential relevance (or irrelevance) in the context of time-series segmentation and alignment could strengthen the paper.

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper presents a promising approach to pre-training large time-series models for cross-domain tasks. The adaptive segmentation module is a novel contribution, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LPTM in terms of both performance and efficiency. While the paper has some weaknesses, particularly in the technical details of the segmentation module and the justification of SSL tasks, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. With some revisions, this paper would be a valuable contribution to the field of time-series analysis. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
