## Review of "Federated Orthogonal Training : Mitigating Global Catastrophic Forgetting in Continual Federated Learning"

This paper addresses a critical challenge in Continual Federated Learning (CFL): Global Catastrophic Forgetting. The authors propose a novel method, Federated Orthogonal Training (FOT), which aims to mitigate forgetting by ensuring that updates from new tasks are orthogonal to the global principal subspace of previous tasks. This approach is significant because it avoids common pitfalls of existing CFL methods, such as requiring access to past data samples or violating the privacy principles of federated learning.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Relevance:** The paper tackles a highly relevant and challenging problem in CFL. As FL moves beyond single-task learning, the ability to learn sequentially arrived tasks without forgetting is crucial.
*   **Novelty of Approach:** FOT introduces a compelling solution based on orthogonal projections. The idea of projecting updates onto the orthogonal subspace of previous tasks' activation subspace is a clever way to reduce interference between tasks and prevent forgetting.
*   **Privacy-Preserving Design:** A key strength is the focus on maintaining client privacy. FOT is compatible with secure aggregation, and the Global Principal Subspace Extraction (GPSE) method is designed to minimize information leakage. The paper also explores additional mechanisms for enhancing privacy, such as the Gaussian mechanism.
*   **Practical Considerations:** The paper addresses practical limitations of edge devices, such as storage constraints and computational power. FOT does not require clients to store past data or perform extra computation on the local training, which makes it a realistic solution for real-world CFL scenarios.
*   **Strong Empirical Evaluation:** The authors conduct extensive experiments on multiple challenging CFL benchmarks, including Permuted MNIST, Split-CIFAR100, 5-Datasets, and Split Mini-Imagenet. The results demonstrate that FOT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods in the CFL setting, achieving a substantial accuracy gain with significantly lower forgetting.
*   **Clear and Well-Structured Presentation:** The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The problem formulation is clear, the proposed solution is explained in detail, and the experimental results are presented in a convincing manner. The figures and tables are informative and help to illustrate the key concepts. Although not a direct focus, the method could be linked with **"model-free rl"** approaches in the sense that the subspace projection avoids explicit modeling of the environment transitions.
*   **Addressing Data Heterogeneity:** The paper explicitly addresses the issue of data heterogeneity across clients, a common challenge in real-world FL deployments. The results demonstrate that FOT is robust under data heterogeneity.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Task Boundaries Assumption:** The paper assumes knowledge of task boundaries in the task-incremental setting. While this assumption is common in much of the CL/CFL literature, it is a limitation that should be acknowledged. The paper briefly discusses the problem of not knowing task boundaries and suggests it as a topic for further research.
*   **Threshold Value Sensitivity:** The performance of FOT is influenced by the threshold value used in the GPSE method. While the paper discusses the trade-off between forgetting and learning new tasks, it could benefit from a more detailed analysis of how to choose the optimal threshold value for different datasets and scenarios.
*   **Communication Overhead Detail**: While the paper claims the communication cost is negligible, it might benefit from a more direct comparison with the communication cost of other methods (beyond claiming that FedCIL increases by "more than 100%"). A detailed breakdown of the bits exchanged for each method on each task would be helpful.
*   **Limited Exploration of Alternative SVD Methods**: The GPSE relies on standard SVD. Exploring more communication and computation-efficient SVD approximations tailored for FL could be a future research direction.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Discuss limitations of FOT**: In the discussion section, acknowledge the limited exploration of alternative algorithms due to time and resource constraints and propose this as a direction for future research.
*   **Expand on Threshold Selection**: Provide more guidance on how to select the appropriate threshold value for different datasets and scenarios. Consider developing an adaptive threshold selection method.
*   **Detail communication costs**: Provide a more direct and precise comparison of the communication costs of FOT and other CFL methods, possibly in a table or graph.
*   **Add details on experiment setting:** Provide details on what kind of optimizers or loss functions are used for each dataset.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of Continual Federated Learning. The proposed FOT method is novel, privacy-preserving, practical, and empirically effective. Despite a few limitations, the paper is well-written and presents a compelling solution to the problem of global catastrophic forgetting in CFL. I recommend this paper for acceptance.
