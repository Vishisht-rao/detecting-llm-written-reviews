## Review of "Learning to Act Without Actions"

This paper presents Latent Action Policies (LAPO), a novel approach for reinforcement learning that learns latent action representations from unlabeled video data. The core idea is to train an Inverse Dynamics Model (IDM) to predict latent actions that explain state transitions, and a Forward Dynamics Model (FDM) to predict the next state given the previous state and the latent action. The latent action space is designed as an information bottleneck, encouraging the IDM to learn a compressed, informative representation of the transition.  The resulting latent-action policy, learned via behavior cloning on IDM-labeled data, can then be fine-tuned in the true action space, either offline with a small labeled dataset or online with rewards.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The paper introduces a genuinely novel approach to learning policies from action-free video data.  The idea of learning latent actions through predictive consistency between IDM and FDM, coupled with vector quantization, is a significant contribution.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The experimental results on the Procgen benchmark are compelling. The paper demonstrates that LAPO can recover expert performance with significantly fewer environment interactions compared to training from scratch with PPO. The ability to exceed expert performance in several tasks is noteworthy. The ablation studies highlight the importance of both the RL fine-tuning and vector quantization components.
*   **Interpretability:** The analysis of the learned latent action space using UMAP projections reveals that the latent action spaces often exhibit structures that closely align with the true action spaces, even without any action labels during training. This provides valuable insight into what the model is learning.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is well-written and clearly explains the method and the experimental setup. The figures are helpful in understanding the LAPO architecture and the results. The inclusion of the code repository enhances reproducibility.
*   **Addresses a Critical Problem:** The work directly tackles the challenge of learning from the vast amounts of unlabeled video data available on the web, which is a major bottleneck in scaling RL.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Discussion of "Pretraining Data Statistics":** The paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of how the characteristics of the unlabeled video data (e.g., the diversity of behaviors, the quality of the demonstrations, the presence of noise or irrelevant information) might influence the performance of LAPO. In other words, a sensitivity analysis of LAPO to the "pretraining data statistics" is warranted. While the paper uses expert data, the application to real-world video may be more challenging.
*   **Scalability to More Complex Environments:** While the results on Procgen are promising, the paper could benefit from a discussion of the challenges associated with scaling LAPO to more complex environments with higher-dimensional observations and action spaces. The computational cost of training the IDM and FDM could become prohibitive. The limitations section touches upon this, but a more detailed analysis would be valuable.
*   **Comparison to a Wider Range of Baselines:** While the comparison to ILPO and PPO is appropriate, including additional baselines, such as other imitation learning from observation (IfO) methods (even though they may require access to the action space *during training*), would strengthen the paper. This would provide a clearer understanding of LAPO's advantages and disadvantages compared to existing approaches.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** A more thorough exploration of the sensitivity of LAPO's performance to key hyperparameters (e.g., the dimensionality of the latent action space, the strength of the information bottleneck) would be beneficial.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   Add a section that discusses the impact of "pretraining data statistics" on the LAPO model. Consider how data diversity and noise may affect the latent action space and performance.
*   Provide a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of LAPO and discuss potential strategies for scaling the method to more complex environments.
*   Include a comparison to additional IfO baselines.
*   Conduct a hyperparameter sensitivity analysis to identify the optimal parameter settings for different environments and datasets.
*   Expand on the limitations section to address potential issues with delayed effects, stochasticity, and scalability.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach for learning policies from action-free video data. The empirical results are compelling, and the analysis of the learned latent action spaces provides valuable insights. While there are some areas for improvement, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning and has the potential to unlock the vast amounts of unlabeled video data available on the web. I recommend acceptance, conditional on addressing the above mentioned suggestions for improvement.
