## Review of "NeRM: Learning Neural Representations for High-Framerate Human Motion Synthesis"

This paper addresses the relatively underexplored and challenging problem of high-framerate human motion synthesis. The authors identify a key limitation of existing approaches: the need to downsample or discard training data with varying framerates, leading to information loss and restricted generation capabilities.  Their proposed solution, NeRM, leverages Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) to represent motion as a continuous function, allowing for training on data with diverse framerates and generating motions at arbitrary framerates. The approach combines a variational INR framework with a latent diffusion model, demonstrating promising results in terms of motion quality, diversity, and generation speed.

**Strengths:**

* **Novelty and Significance:** The paper tackles a relevant and challenging problem in human motion synthesis. The use of INRs to address the issue of variable framerates is a novel and promising approach. The ability to generate motions at arbitrary framerates, especially high framerates, is a significant contribution.
* **Technical Soundness:** The proposed NeRM architecture is well-motivated and technically sound. The combination of variational INRs and a latent diffusion model provides a robust framework for capturing the complex distribution of human motions. The incorporation of a codebook-coordinate attention mechanism further enhances the representation capabilities of the model.
* **Comprehensive Experiments:** The authors conduct thorough experiments on various datasets (HumanML3D, KIT, HumanAct12, UESTC, AMASS) and tasks (text-to-motion, action-to-motion, unconditional generation).  The quantitative results demonstrate that NeRM achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The introduction of the "clip-FID" metric is valuable for evaluating the quality of high-framerate details. The ablation studies provide insights into the effectiveness of different components of the NeRM architecture. The user study provides important qualitative validation.
* **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The figures are informative and help to illustrate the proposed approach. The detailed implementation details and evaluation metrics provided in the appendix are appreciated.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited Discussion of Time Series Specific INRs:** While the paper leverages INRs, it would be beneficial to see a more thorough comparison to other time series specific INR approaches, if any exist. The current related work section focuses mostly on static INR applications.
* **Computational Cost:** While the paper mentions the fast inference speed, the relatively slow training process is a concern, particularly for large datasets. The limitations section acknowledges this, but further discussion of potential optimizations would be valuable.
* **Generalization Concerns on Extreme Framerates:** The paper acknowledges that the framerate range is limited by the training data. It is unclear how well NeRM would generalize to generating motions at significantly higher framerates than those present in the training data.  This could be explored further in future work.
* **Lack of Discussion on Potential Biases and Ethical Implications:**  The paper doesn't discuss potential biases in the datasets used for training or the ethical implications of generating realistic human motions, especially when conditioned on text or other potentially sensitive information. This is important to consider, even if briefly.

**Minor Comments and Suggestions:**

* Figure 2 could benefit from more detailed explanations of the "Codebook-Coordinate Attention Modules" and how the framerate embedding is incorporated.
* The term "native framerates" is used throughout the paper. While understandable, perhaps using "original framerates" would be more precise.
* The paper does not explicitly address scenarios involving adversarial attacks or the robustness of the model against noisy inputs. While outside the main scope, acknowledging these considerations would be helpful.

**Overall Assessment:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach for high-framerate human motion synthesis. The use of INRs to address the challenges of variable framerates is a significant contribution. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of NeRM over existing methods. The paper is well-written and organized, and the detailed implementation details and evaluation metrics are appreciated. I recommend accepting this paper for ICLR 2024.

I would be interested to know, if the authors considered any aspects of "performative prediction" in their design, especially related to the sampling strategy within the latent diffusion model, and how it might be affecting the diversity of generated motions in practice. Addressing these concerns could further strengthen the contribution of the paper.
