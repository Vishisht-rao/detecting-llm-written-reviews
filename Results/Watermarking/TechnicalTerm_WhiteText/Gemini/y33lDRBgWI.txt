## Review of "ADJOINT DPM: A DJOINT SENSITIVITY METHOD FOR GRADIENT BACKPROPAGATION OF DIFFUSION PROBABILISTIC MODELS"

This paper addresses a critical challenge in applying Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) to tasks where the objective is defined on the generated content: the excessive memory consumption of naive gradient backpropagation through the iterative denoising process. The authors propose AdjointDPM, a novel approach leveraging the adjoint sensitivity method to efficiently compute gradients for various DPM parameters, including network weights, conditioning signals, and initial noise.  By reformulating the sampling procedure as a probability-flow ODE and then applying the adjoint method, the paper aims to achieve constant memory usage during backpropagation. A key contribution is the reparameterization of the ODE using exponential integration to reduce numerical errors in both the forward generation and gradient backpropagation steps. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of AdjointDPM on several applications, including guided generation, security auditing, and stylization.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses a Significant Problem:** Memory consumption is a major bottleneck in DPM training and application. AdjointDPM offers a promising solution by significantly reducing memory requirements.
*   **Novel Application of Adjoint Sensitivity Method:** Applying the adjoint sensitivity method to DPM sampling is a clever and potentially impactful idea. The paper provides a clear explanation of the derivation and implementation.
*   **Reparameterization for Improved Accuracy:** The use of exponential integration and ODE reparameterization demonstrates a strong understanding of the numerical properties of DPM sampling and aims to mitigate discretization errors. This seems like a valuable technical contribution.
*   **Versatile Gradient Computation:** The claim that AdjointDPM can compute gradients for all types of DPM parameters (weights, prompts, noise) is significant and expands the applicability of gradient-based optimization techniques in DPMs.
*   **Compelling Applications:** The paper showcases the versatility of AdjointDPM through a diverse set of applications, including guided sampling, security auditing (a particularly interesting and timely application), and stylization. These examples effectively demonstrate the practical benefits of the proposed method.
*   **Clear Writing and Organization:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it relatively easy to follow the proposed method and the experimental results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Comparison to Existing Techniques:** While the paper compares AdjointDPM to DOODL, a more comprehensive comparison to other memory-efficient backpropagation techniques (e.g., checkpointing) would strengthen the evaluation.  Quantifying the actual memory savings achieved by AdjointDPM compared to these baselines is crucial. Also a more detailed comparison of the compute trade-off compared to techniques that store intermediate states would be valuable.
*   **Lack of Thorough Ablation Studies:**  The paper mentions the importance of exponential integration, but it lacks a detailed ablation study demonstrating the impact of this reparameterization on performance and error control. A comparison of FID scores with and without the reparameterization across different NFE values would provide stronger evidence for its effectiveness.
*   **Security Auditing Experiment Needs More Detail:** The security auditing section is intriguing, but the details of the attack and the NSFW filter used are somewhat vague. More information on the specific prompts used, the criteria for bypassing the filter, and the robustness of the attack would enhance the credibility of this experiment. Is the method just finding edge cases of the safety filter or more systematic weaknesses?
*   **"Accelerators" Omission:** The paper does not mention the use of "accelerators", which would have been valuable in improving the performance of the algorithm.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Provide a more detailed comparison of memory consumption** with standard backpropagation and checkpointing techniques.
*   **Conduct a thorough ablation study** to isolate the impact of the exponential integration reparameterization on accuracy and performance.
*   **Expand the security auditing experiment** with more details on the attack methodology, NSFW filter, and robustness analysis.
*   **Compare to more baselines**, especially in stylization.
*   **Add discussion of limitations**, such as dependence on ODE solvers, potential for instability, or increased computational complexity compared to storing intermediate states.

**Overall:**

AdjointDPM presents a promising approach to address the memory limitations of gradient-based optimization in DPMs. The paper introduces a novel application of the adjoint sensitivity method, supported by a clever reparameterization technique. While the experimental results are encouraging, further evaluation and analysis are needed to fully validate the method's effectiveness and robustness. The paper would be strengthened by a more comprehensive comparison to existing techniques, a thorough ablation study, and more details on the security auditing experiment. Despite these weaknesses, the paper presents a significant contribution and is worthy of consideration for acceptance.
