## Review of "NOISE -FREE SCORE DISTILLATION"

This paper tackles the challenging problem of leveraging pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models for content generation in domains beyond images, specifically focusing on the Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) approach. The paper presents a novel interpretation of SDS, arguing that the need for large Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) scales stems from distilling an undesired noise term. Based on this interpretation, they propose Noise-Free Score Distillation (NFSD), a modification of SDS that aims to improve distillation effectiveness while using more reasonable CFG scales.

**Strengths:**

* **Clear Problem Definition and Motivation:** The paper clearly articulates the limitations of SDS, particularly the tendency to produce over-smoothed and over-saturated results with limited fine details. The motivation for addressing these issues is well-established and relevant to the field.
* **Insightful Interpretation of SDS:** The decomposition of the score function into alignment with the condition, domain correction, and denoising components provides a novel and intuitively understandable perspective on the SDS process. This decomposition helps to demystify the role of CFG and the challenges associated with direct noise distillation.
* **Well-Defined NFSD Approach:** The proposed NFSD is a logical extension of the authors' interpretation of SDS. The method for approximating the domain correction term (δD) based on timestep values and negative prompts is clearly explained and relatively straightforward to implement. The paper carefully justifies the design choices of NFSD.
* **Strong Qualitative Results:** The qualitative comparisons between NFSD and SDS, both for 2D image generation and NeRF synthesis, are compelling. The NFSD results consistently exhibit improved detail, realism, and adherence to the input prompt. The additional figures in the appendix are helpful for visualizing the score components and providing further results.
* **Explanation of Existing Methods:** The paper convincingly demonstrates how the proposed score decomposition formulation can be used to explain and contextualize the improvements offered by recent methods like DDS and VSD. This strengthens the generality and applicability of their framework.
* **User Study & Quantitative results:** The inclusion of a user study providing compelling evidence that users on average preferred images generated from NFSD than other methods. The quantitative results based on FID are also presented providing good support to their findings.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited Novelty in Domain Correction Approximation:** While the overall framework is insightful, the specific approach for approximating the domain correction term (δD) relies on heuristics. While these heuristics are justified, they could be seen as relatively simple and might not be universally applicable across all prompts or datasets. A more robust and principled approach for isolating δD would be valuable.
* **Lack of Explicit Quantitative Comparison with all Related Methods:** While a qualitative comparison with several state-of-the-art methods is provided, a more comprehensive quantitative comparison (e.g., using metrics like FID or CLIP score on a standardized benchmark) would further strengthen the paper's claims. The comparisons rely on results reported in other papers, which may use different implementations and training details. The appendix addresses this somewhat, but a more thorough analysis in the main paper would be beneficial.
* **Discussion of Janus and Diversity is Brief:** The paper briefly mentions the Janus problem and diversity issues, but doesn't offer any concrete solutions or explore how NFSD might impact these aspects. A more in-depth discussion of these limitations and potential future directions would be helpful. Also, they mention that "the diffusion scores that guide the optimization are uncorrelated across successive iterations, even if noise is successfully eliminated", this claim could have more support using experiments.
* **Missing "random initialisation" term in SDS compared to NFSD.** It is not clear how much better is NFSD with a "random initialisation" compared to SDS which usually does not have it.
**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Explore More Robust Domain Correction:** Investigate alternative approaches for approximating or estimating the domain correction term (δD). This could involve exploring learned domain adaptation techniques or incorporating additional information about the differences between rendered and real images.
* **Conduct More Extensive Quantitative Evaluation:** Perform a more thorough quantitative evaluation against a wider range of state-of-the-art methods using standardized benchmarks and metrics. This would provide more objective evidence of NFSD's performance improvements.
* **Address Janus and Diversity Issues:** Discuss potential strategies for mitigating the Janus problem and improving the diversity of generated results within the NFSD framework. This could involve incorporating techniques like view-dependent prompting or exploring alternative noise scheduling strategies.
* **Elaborate on Computational Cost:** Provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of NFSD compared to SDS and other related methods. While the paper claims that NFSD doesn't incur additional computational costs, a more precise comparison would be helpful.
* **Consider Initialisation:** Compare NFSD with "random initialisation" against other methods without it.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of text-to-3D generation by offering a novel interpretation of SDS and introducing the NFSD approach. The paper is well-written, clearly motivated, and supported by compelling qualitative results. While there are some areas for improvement, the insights and contributions of this work make it a worthwhile contribution to the conference.

**Recommendation:** Accept. The paper offers a good framework with some experiments.
