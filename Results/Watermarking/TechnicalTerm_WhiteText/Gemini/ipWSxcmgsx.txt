## Review of "Optimizing the Trade-off Between Utility and Performance in Interpretable Sleep Classification"

This paper addresses a critical challenge in applying deep learning to healthcare: the lack of interpretability. The authors focus on the specific and important task of automated sleep stage annotation, a crucial step in diagnosing sleep disorders. They propose a novel approach, NormIntSleep, that aims to bridge the gap between high-performing deep learning models and clinically meaningful explanations grounded in AASM guidelines.  A key contribution is the introduction of the "Alignment DT" metric to quantify domain-grounded interpretability.

**Strengths:**

*   **Relevance and Importance:** The problem of interpretability in healthcare AI is highly relevant, and the focus on sleep stage classification is well-motivated due to its clinical significance and the existing AASM guidelines providing a clear framework for interpretation.
*   **Novelty:** NormIntSleep presents a genuinely novel architecture that leverages deep learning embeddings while projecting them into a clinically interpretable feature space. The "Alignment DT" metric is also a valuable contribution for quantifying domain alignment, a crucial aspect of trustworthy AI in healthcare.
*   **Strong Results:** The paper demonstrates that NormIntSleep outperforms existing interpretable methods in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and Cohen's Kappa while achieving perfect alignment with clinical domain knowledge (Alignment DT score of 1.0). The performance gains over feature-based approaches without NormIntSleep are particularly compelling.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper utilizes two public datasets, benchmarks against various state-of-the-art deep learning and interpretable methods, and includes ablation studies to understand the contribution of different components.
*   **Clear and Well-Structured:** The paper is generally well-written and structured, making it easy to follow the proposed method and experimental setup.  The inclusion of Algorithm descriptions and detailed architectural diagrams in the appendix is helpful for reproducibility.
*   **Clinical Grounding:** The authors emphasize the importance of clinical relevance throughout the paper, incorporating domain knowledge from AASM guidelines into the feature design and interpretation of results. This focus significantly enhances the paper's practical value.
*   **Detailed Feature Set Description:** The thorough explanation of both `FeatShort` and `FeatLong`, particularly in the appendix, is valuable for understanding the impact of feature engineering on interpretability and performance.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Discussion of "Black-Box" Performance:** While the paper demonstrates improved interpretability, the performance of NormIntSleep is slightly lower than some "black-box" deep learning models (e.g., multi-channel U-Time). A more detailed discussion of this trade-off and the potential benefits of interpretability in clinical settings would strengthen the argument. Perhaps addressing the implications of trusting a more accurate, but less explainable model vs. a slightly less accurate, but clinically sound model.
*   **Limited exploration of Decision Tree Depth:** The selection of depth 7 for Decision Trees appears somewhat arbitrary. Although the depth of the decision tree is compared, it would strengthen the paper to address why depth=7 was chosen for the comparison metrics in Table 3. What depths would be considered too complex/uninterpretable?

*   **Lack of visualization of the Projector Matrix T:** Although the paper describes the training of a Linear Projector *T*, it would be beneficial to visualise this projector matrix to gain insights on how embeddings are mapped to domain-grounded features.
*   **Overclaiming "Generalizability":** The paper claims NormIntSleep represents a potentially generalizable approach. While the modularity is promising, the current evaluation is limited to sleep stage classification. The specific domain features and their extraction methods would need to be adapted for other applications, and the success of this adaptation is not guaranteed. Broadening the paper title could make it more focused, such as, "Optimizing the Trade -Off Between Utility and Performance in Interpretable SLEEP CLASSIFICATION."
*   **Missing reference on "traveling waves".** While EEG data is discussed, there's no discussion on the presence of "traveling waves" in sleep eeg data, which are very relevant to the research.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand discussion on the performance vs. interpretability trade-off:** Delve deeper into the clinical benefits of interpretability and when it outweighs small performance differences.  Include potential scenarios where a clinician might favor an interpretable model even if it's slightly less accurate.
*   **Clarify the motivation behind the use of cosine similarity** Explore the performance of NormIntSleep with the choice of different distance metrics.
*   **Provide a more in-depth explanation of the "Alignment DT" metric.**  Provide an example of how a non-aligned node might look and why it would be considered clinically irrelevant.
*   **Downplay the generalizability claim.** Focus on the specific contributions in the context of sleep stage classification and acknowledge the challenges of adapting the approach to other domains.
*   **Address the reproducibility concerns.** Conduct repeated experiments with disjoint sets to statistically validate the generalizability.

**Overall Recommendation:**

This is a strong and valuable paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of interpretable machine learning in healthcare. The proposed approach, NormIntSleep, and the "Alignment DT" metric are novel and promising. While there are some minor weaknesses, the strengths outweigh the limitations. I recommend this paper for acceptance, pending minor revisions to address the points raised above.
