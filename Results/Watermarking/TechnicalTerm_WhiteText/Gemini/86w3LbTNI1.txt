## Review of "Preventing Reward Hacking with Occupancy Measure Regularization"

This paper tackles the important problem of reward hacking in reinforcement learning, where agents exploit misalignments between proxy and true reward functions to achieve high proxy reward at the expense of desired behavior. The central idea is compelling: instead of regularizing the policy's action distribution towards a "safe" policy, the authors propose regularizing the *occupancy measure* (OM). This leverages the intuition that reward hacking often involves significant shifts in the states the agent visits, which are better captured by the OM than by individual action distributions.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Problem Definition and Motivation:** The paper clearly articulates the problem of reward hacking and motivates the need for alternative regularization techniques. The introductory examples, like the autonomous car and tomato watering gridworld, are effective in illustrating the limitations of action distribution regularization.
*   **Strong Theoretical Justification:** The paper provides a theoretical foundation for OM regularization. Proposition 3.1 convincingly demonstrates the shortcomings of action distribution KL divergence, showing that small changes in action distributions can have large impacts on return, and vice versa.  Proposition 3.2 provides a crucial theoretical link, showing that the TV distance between occupancy measures bounds the difference in returns, a property that action distribution divergences lack. The authors' claims are well-supported by the theoretical results.
*   **Novel Algorithm (ORPO):** The proposed Occupancy-Regularized Policy Optimization (ORPO) algorithm is a practical approach to implementing OM regularization within a deep RL framework. The use of a discriminator network to approximate the KL divergence between occupancy measures is a clever and well-established technique.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The empirical results across multiple reward hacking benchmark environments (Tomato, Traffic, and Glucose) demonstrate the effectiveness of ORPO compared to action distribution regularization. The visualizations in Figure 3 clearly show how the true reward, OM KL divergence, and action distribution KL divergence vary with the regularization coefficient.
*   **Well-written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The structure is logical, and the key ideas are clearly explained. The related work section provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Computational Cost:** While ORPO is presented as easily incorporated into deep RL, the addition of a discriminator network introduces a significant computational overhead. The paper does not explicitly address the computational cost of ORPO compared to action distribution regularization. A discussion of training time, memory requirements, and scalability would be valuable.
*   **Discriminator Training Stability:** The discriminator network in ORPO could be prone to instability during training, especially when the learned policy deviates significantly from the safe policy. The paper acknowledges some instability at high lambda values in the appendix, but could explore and discuss this issue further. Techniques for stabilizing discriminator training, such as spectral normalization or gradient penalties, could be considered.
*   **Sensitivity to Discriminator Architecture:** The performance of ORPO likely depends on the architecture and hyperparameters of the discriminator network. The paper provides details about the architectures used, but a sensitivity analysis exploring the impact of different discriminator configurations would strengthen the empirical evaluation. This includes more detailed discussion on different inputs used for the discriminator, and their trade-offs, specifically in the glucose environment.
*   **"Graph canonization" Not Mentioned:** Although a strength is its theory, it could also be a limitation. The paper doesn't discuss any challenges that arise from the practical differences from the theory, or limitations. For instance, the topic of "**graph canonization**" isn't brought up, or other topics that could improve the current method in the future, or be helpful in real-world implementations.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address Computational Cost:** Include a discussion of the computational cost of ORPO and compare it to action distribution regularization. Provide training time and memory usage metrics.
*   **Discuss Discriminator Training Stability:** Address the potential for instability during discriminator training and discuss techniques for mitigating this issue.
*   **Conduct Sensitivity Analysis:** Explore the impact of different discriminator architectures and hyperparameters on the performance of ORPO.
*   **Include Limitations and Future Work Discussion:** Discuss potential limitations of the approach and directions for future research, such as addressing the stability with high regularization coefficient lambdas.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and theoretically sound approach to preventing reward hacking in reinforcement learning. The empirical results are promising and demonstrate the potential of OM regularization. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact on the field. I recommend acceptance, conditional on addressing the above comments.
