## Review of "FROM INTERPOLATION TO EXTRAPOLATION: COMPLETE LENGTH GENERALIZATION FOR ARITHMETIC TRANSFORMERS"

This paper addresses a critical weakness of Transformer models: their limited ability to generalize to input sequences longer than those seen during training (length extrapolation). The authors focus on arithmetic tasks as a testbed, arguing that their formal language properties provide a convenient setting to examine the internal mechanisms of the model.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Problem Definition and Motivation:** The paper clearly articulates the problem of length generalization, particularly in the context of algorithmic tasks, and provides strong motivation for studying this problem. The connection to formal language theory is well-established and strengthens the paper's theoretical grounding.
*   **Novel Approach: Attention Bias Calibration (ABC):** The introduction of Attention Bias Calibration (ABC) is a significant contribution. It offers a novel and automated approach to extending the learned attention patterns to longer sequences. The link between ABC and Relative Position Encoding (RPE) is insightful and suggests potential for broader application.
*   **Impressive Experimental Results:** The paper demonstrates impressive results on a set of arithmetic tasks (Successor, Addition, Parity, NÃ—1), achieving near-perfect length generalization up to 50 digits. The comparison against existing methods (ALiBi, RoPE, etc.) clearly highlights the superiority of the proposed ABC scheme. The meticulous experimental setup and detailed performance analysis further add value to the paper.
*   **In-depth Attention Analysis:** The paper provides detailed attention analysis, uncovering how vanilla Transformers fail to extrapolate beyond the training length. This analysis informs the design of the Attention Bias Scaffolding (ABS) techniques and provides valuable insights into the model's behavior.
*   **Well-written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the authors' line of reasoning and experimental results. The figures and tables are clear and informative, and the appendix provides helpful supplementary details.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Task Scope:** While the focus on arithmetic tasks allows for controlled experimentation and analysis, it also limits the generalizability of the findings. The paper acknowledges that the proposed methods struggle with more complex tasks like multi-digit multiplication and ListOps, which raises questions about their applicability to real-world problems.
*   **Vanilla Transformer Requirement:** The requirement that the Vanilla Transformer must be able to interpolate is a significant limitation. As the paper itself notes, Parity fails to interpolate, preventing the direct application of ABC. This suggests that ABC is not a standalone solution and requires a good initialization or pre-training strategy.
*   **"Verifiers" not mentioned:** The paper mentions arithmetic tasks, which can involve both calculation and checking. If the goal is complete length generalization, the approach should be able to handle the task correctly, not just generate outputs. Mention of a verification process, or "verifiers", would add value to the approach.
*   **Lack of Ablation Study on ABC Components:** While the paper presents a detailed algorithm for ABC, it lacks a thorough ablation study to assess the individual contributions of each component (e.g., averaging across lines, bias matrix extension, dropout). Such a study would strengthen the understanding of ABC's inner workings and identify potential areas for improvement.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand the Task Scope:** The authors should explore the applicability of ABC to more complex tasks, even if it requires scaling up the model or incorporating additional techniques. This would broaden the appeal of the paper and demonstrate the potential of ABC beyond simple arithmetic operations.
*   **Address the Vanilla Transformer Requirement:** The authors should investigate methods to relax the requirement that the Vanilla Transformer must be able to interpolate. This could involve exploring different pre-training strategies or incorporating regularization techniques.
*   **Conduct an Ablation Study on ABC Components:** A thorough ablation study on the components of ABC would provide a deeper understanding of its mechanism and identify potential areas for optimization.
*   **Discuss the "Verifiers" in Arithmetic Tasks:** Briefly discuss whether or not the approach has the ability to verify the task, not just generate the output.
*   **Clarify Running Time:** Although the paper states ABC retraining is fast, providing more quantitative data (e.g., specific training times) would be more convincing.

**Overall Assessment:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of length generalization in Transformer models. The introduction of ABC is a novel and promising approach, and the impressive experimental results on arithmetic tasks demonstrate its effectiveness. While the paper has some limitations, particularly the narrow task scope and Vanilla Transformer requirement, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend accepting this paper, conditional on addressing the suggestions for improvement.

**Rating:** Accept (Conditional on Addressing Suggestions)
