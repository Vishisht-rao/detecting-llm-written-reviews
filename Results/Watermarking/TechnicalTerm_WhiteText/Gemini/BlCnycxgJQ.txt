## Review of "An Inexact Regularized Adaptive Algorithm with Manifold Identification for Training Structured Neural Networks"

**Summary:**

This paper proposes a novel algorithm, RAMDA (Regularized Adaptive Momentumized Dual Averaging), for training structured neural networks. The key contributions are: (1) an adaptive algorithm that provably identifies the locally optimal structure induced by regularization, (2) an efficient subproblem solver for regularized adaptive methods that addresses the lack of closed-form solutions, and (3) strong empirical performance on modern deep learning tasks in computer vision, language processing, and speech. The paper leverages manifold identification theory to guarantee that the iterates converge to a point with a desirable structure. The authors also provide a general iterative subroutine to approximately solve the subproblems of RAMDA as well as other existing frameworks.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The paper tackles a relevant and important problem: training large neural networks with structural constraints to reduce computational cost. Proposing an adaptive method with theoretical guarantees for manifold identification is a significant advance. This addresses limitations of existing non-adaptive methods, making the approach potentially applicable to a wider range of modern deep learning architectures like Transformers and LSTMs.
*   **Theoretical Foundation:** The paper provides a strong theoretical foundation for RAMDA. The convergence analysis, variance reduction, and manifold identification proofs are rigorous. The theorems establish that RAMDA identifies the active manifold after a finite number of steps, ensuring locally optimal structure.
*   **Efficient Subproblem Solver:** The proposed inexactness condition and subproblem solver address a critical bottleneck in regularized adaptive methods. The PG-based approach allows for efficient computation of approximate solutions while maintaining theoretical guarantees. This is a valuable contribution that enables the practical application of both RAMDA and existing frameworks.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The extensive experimental results on ImageNet, Transformer-XL, and Tacotron2 demonstrate the effectiveness of RAMDA. The algorithm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both prediction performance and structured sparsity. The detailed comparison with other algorithms, including ablations of the subproblem solver, provides compelling evidence for the benefits of RAMDA.
*   **Clarity and Organization:** The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making the algorithm and its underlying principles understandable. The introduction effectively motivates the problem and highlights the contributions.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Discussion of "Interpretability Methods":** While the paper focuses on structured sparsity and low rank, explicitly discussing how these features aid *interpretability*, and how they compare to other "interpretability methods" would further strengthen the paper's impact. Is the identified structure more interpretable for humans, and if so, how? This is not clear.
*   **Limited Ablation Studies:** While the results are strong, further ablation studies could provide additional insights. For example, how does performance vary with different regularization strengths? A more comprehensive analysis of the hyperparameters' influence would be beneficial.
*   **Smaller Datasets Performance:** The reported performance on smaller datasets (CIFAR10/100) shows inconsistent improvements over other methods. It would be useful to investigate the reasons for this and potentially suggest guidelines for when RAMDA is most appropriate. The appendix mentions that more algorithms could be tested on smaller problem sizes, implying a lack of focus on such problems.
*   **Kurdkya-Lojasiewicz Condition Assumption:** The paper mentions that establishing convergence using a Kurdkya-Lojasiewicz condition is a challenging future work. The paper would improve if it explicitly discusses the shortcomings of its convergence guarantees due to this lack of a subgradient-descent-like behavior.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand on interpretability:** Discuss how the structured sparsity and low-rank structures induced by RAMDA can be leveraged for better interpretability. Compare these techniques with other existing "interpretability methods" in the field.
*   **Conduct more ablation studies:** Investigate the impact of regularization strength and other key hyperparameters on the performance of RAMDA.
*   **Address smaller dataset performance:** Explore why RAMDA might not consistently outperform existing methods on smaller datasets. Provide guidance on when RAMDA is most suitable.
*   **Discuss future work assumptions:** Explain the requirements for a subgradient-descent-like behavior more explicitly, and clarify what kind of assumptions or challenges are posed when attempting to extend convergence using the Kurdkya-Lojasiewicz condition.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Despite the minor weaknesses, this is a strong paper with significant contributions to the field of structured neural network training. The proposed algorithm, RAMDA, offers a compelling combination of theoretical guarantees, efficient implementation, and strong empirical performance. The paper is well-written and the results are convincing. I recommend acceptance.
