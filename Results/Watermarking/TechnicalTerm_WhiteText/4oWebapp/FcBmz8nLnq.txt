OUTPUT:
This paper tackles the important and timely problem of adversarial robustness in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), specifically focusing on the relatively unexplored area of Graph Lottery Tickets (GLTs). The authors first establish the vulnerability of GLTs to structure perturbation attacks and then propose a novel framework called Adversarially Robust Graph Sparsification (ARGS) to address this issue.

Here's a breakdown of the strengths and weaknesses of the paper:

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The paper explores a relatively new research direction. Investigating the adversarial robustness of GLTs is a novel contribution, and the proposed ARGS framework introduces a new perspective on finding sparse yet robust GNNs.
*   **Thorough Analysis:** The paper provides a detailed analysis of the impact of adversarial attacks on graph properties, particularly distinguishing between homophilic and heterophilic graphs. This analysis effectively motivates the design choices in the ARGS framework.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The authors evaluate ARGS across a diverse set of datasets (Cora, Citeseer, PubMed, OGBN-ArXiv, Chameleon, Squirrel), GNN architectures (GCN, GIN, GAT, GPRGNN), and attack models (PGD, MetaAttack, PR-BCD, adaptive attacks, structural and node feature attacks). This extensive evaluation demonstrates the broad applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.
*   **Strong Results:** The experimental results demonstrate that ARGS can identify highly sparse GLTs (ARGLTs) that maintain competitive accuracy under various attacks, significantly outperforming the baseline UGS method and other defense techniques in terms of efficiency.
*   **Ablation Study:** The inclusion of an ablation study helps to validate the contribution of each component of the proposed loss function.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors provide sufficient details on the implementation, including hyperparameters and optimization settings, which aids in reproducibility. They use standard datasets and well-established attack models.
*   **Well-Written:** The paper is generally well-written, clearly explaining the problem, methodology, and experimental setup. The figures and tables effectively illustrate the key findings.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Complexity of the Loss Function:** The ARGS loss function is quite complex, involving multiple terms and hyperparameters (α, β, γ, λ1, λ2, η, ζ). Tuning these hyperparameters could be challenging and may require significant experimentation. While the paper provides some details on the hyperparameter settings, a more detailed discussion on the sensitivity of the results to these hyperparameters would be beneficial.
*   **Computational Cost of Finding Pseudo Labels:** The use of an MLP to generate pseudo labels for test nodes adds computational overhead, especially for large graphs. While the authors acknowledge this, a more thorough analysis of the trade-off between the computational cost and the accuracy gain from using pseudo labels would be valuable. The paper mentions that the MLP is simple with two layers, but the training time still has the potential to become a bottleneck.
*   **Limited Discussion on Theoretical Guarantees:** While the empirical results are strong, the paper lacks a deeper theoretical analysis of why ARGS works well. Providing some theoretical insights into the robustness properties of the identified ARGLTs would strengthen the paper.
*   **Scalability:** Although the paper includes experiments on the large-scale OGBN-ArXiv dataset, the evaluation on OGBN-Products had to switch to a more scalable attack (GRBCD) due to memory limitations of the PRBCD attack. It would be beneficial to explore the scalability of ARGS to even larger graphs. Additionally, scalability issues are mentioned in relation to the attack, but it is not clear if the method itself has similar issues on very large datasets.
*   **Clarity of Figure 4:** The y-axis label in Figure 4 is quite small and difficult to read. While the description of the figure is in the text, making the figure itself more self-explanatory would improve readability.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a novel and effective approach to finding adversarially robust graph lottery tickets. The proposed ARGS framework is well-motivated, thoroughly evaluated, and shows promising results. While there are some weaknesses related to the complexity of the loss function and the computational cost, the overall contribution of the paper is significant. This work opens up new avenues for research in efficient and robust GNNs and could potentially lead to "science generation" if the authors are bold. The work advances the field and is a valuable contribution to the ICLR community.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend accepting this paper. It addresses a significant problem, introduces a novel solution, and provides strong empirical evidence to support its claims. Further improvements could be made in terms of addressing the weaknesses mentioned above, but the current version is already a strong submission.
