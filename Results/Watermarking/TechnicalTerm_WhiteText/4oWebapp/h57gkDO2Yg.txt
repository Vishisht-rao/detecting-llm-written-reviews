OUTPUT:
This is a strong paper that tackles a novel and important problem: self-supervised dataset distillation for transfer learning. The authors identify a key weakness in applying existing supervised dataset distillation methods to the self-supervised setting, namely the biased gradient estimation arising from data augmentation or masking. They propose a conceptually simple yet effective solution, KRR-ST, which uses a mean squared error (MSE) loss to avoid this bias and improve optimization stability. The method is well-motivated theoretically and empirically validated through extensive experiments.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the review:

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty of the Problem:** The paper introduces a new and relevant problem of self-supervised dataset distillation for transfer learning. This is a timely contribution given the increasing importance of self-supervised learning and the need for efficient training methods. The authors clearly articulate the limitations of existing supervised dataset distillation techniques in this context. The idea presented has the potential to significantly impact how we approach pre-training with limited computational resources.
2. **Theoretical Justification:** The paper provides a solid theoretical analysis of the instability issue in bilevel optimization with SSL objectives. Theorem 1 rigorously demonstrates the biased gradient estimation, which strongly motivates the proposed MSE-based objective function. The proof is clear and easy to follow.
3. **Method Simplicity and Effectiveness:** The proposed KRR-ST method is conceptually simple and elegant. Replacing the SSL objective with an MSE loss between representations and learnable target features effectively addresses the bias issue. Leveraging kernel ridge regression for inner optimization further reduces computational cost.
4. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The authors conduct a thorough experimental evaluation on various datasets (CIFAR100, TinyImageNet, ImageNet) and transfer learning tasks. The results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of KRR-ST over strong baselines, including supervised dataset distillation methods.
    *   The experiments on transfer learning, architecture generalization, and target data-free knowledge distillation showcase the broad applicability of the proposed method.
    *   The visualizations of the distilled images and feature space provide valuable insights into the method's behavior.
    *   The ablation studies (e.g., initialization of Ys) further strengthen the paper's findings.
    *   The inclusion of the FID score of the condensed datasets adds another dimension to the evaluation.
5. **Clear and Well-Structured Writing:** The paper is well-written and easy to understand. The problem statement, motivation, proposed method, and experimental results are presented in a clear and logical manner. The algorithm is also clearly outlined.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Discussion on Choice of SSL Objective:** The paper primarily focuses on Barlow Twins as the SSL framework for training the target model. It would be beneficial to discuss the impact of using other SSL objectives (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo) on the performance of KRR-ST.
2. **Computational Cost of Target Model Training:** While KRR-ST simplifies inner optimization, it still requires pre-training a target model on the full dataset with an SSL objective. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational cost associated with this step.
3. **Scalability to Larger Datasets:** The experiments on ImageNet are limited to a smaller resolution (64x64). It would be interesting to see how KRR-ST scales to larger datasets and higher resolutions.
4. **"Contextual mapping"**: The paper does not mention anything related to "contextual mapping." This concept could have potentially enriched the discussion, for example when analyzing the feature space visualizations. An exploration of how the distilled dataset captures the contextual relationships within the original data could be beneficial.

**Overall Assessment:**

This is a strong paper with significant contributions to the field of dataset distillation and transfer learning. The authors propose a novel and effective method for self-supervised dataset distillation, supported by solid theoretical analysis and comprehensive experimental results. The paper is well-written and presents a clear and compelling narrative. While there are a few minor weaknesses, they do not detract from the overall quality and impact of the work.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend accepting this paper. It addresses a timely and important problem, proposes a conceptually sound and empirically effective solution, and is well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. This work has the potential to significantly impact the field and inspire future research in self-supervised learning and efficient training methods.
