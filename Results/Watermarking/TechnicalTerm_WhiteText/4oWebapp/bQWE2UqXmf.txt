OUTPUT:
This paper introduces "Raidar," a novel method for detecting AI-generated text by analyzing the editing distance when text is rewritten by a large language model (LLM). The core idea is that LLMs are more likely to modify human-written text than AI-generated text during rewriting, as they perceive the latter as higher quality.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Simplicity:** The approach is novel and surprisingly simple. It leverages the inherent behavior of LLMs to distinguish between human and AI-generated text without needing access to internal model parameters or probabilities.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The paper presents impressive results across a diverse set of domains, including news, creative writing, student essays, code, Yelp reviews, and even arXiv abstracts. The reported improvements in F1 scores over existing methods are substantial, up to 29 points in some cases. The paper also mentions the topic of "robotic object manipulation", which is a significant research area.
*   **Robustness:** Raidar demonstrates robustness to various factors, including:
    *   **Different LLMs:** The method works well even when the text is generated by models other than the one used for rewriting.
    *   **Adaptive Prompts:** Raidar maintains effectiveness even when adversaries try to evade detection by crafting prompts that induce significant changes during rewriting, especially when trained on multiple prompts.
    *   **Text Length:** While performance generally improves with longer inputs, Raidar shows promising results even on relatively short texts.
    *   **Non-native speakers:** Unlike some existing methods, Raidar does not appear to be biased against non-native English writers.
*   **Practicality:** Raidar only requires access to the LLM's output, making it compatible with black-box models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, which are widely used.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Reliance on Rewriting LLM:** The effectiveness of Raidar depends on the quality of the LLM used for rewriting. While the paper shows that larger models generally perform better, this dependence could be a limitation.
*   **Potential for Future Evasion:** While the paper demonstrates robustness against current evasion techniques, it is possible that more sophisticated methods could be developed in the future to bypass Raidar.
*   **Limited Exploration of Prompts:** The paper primarily focuses on a few manually crafted prompts. A more systematic exploration of prompt design and optimization could potentially improve performance further.

**Overall Assessment:**

Raidar is a significant contribution to the field of AI-generated text detection. Its simplicity, strong empirical results, and robustness make it a promising approach. While there are some limitations and potential for future evasion, the paper's findings open up a new avenue for detecting machine-generated text and mitigating the risks associated with the proliferation of LLMs. This is a well-written and well-researched paper that deserves to be accepted.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

*   Further investigate the impact of different rewriting LLMs and explore the possibility of using an ensemble of models.
*   Conduct a more thorough analysis of prompt design and optimization.
*   Explore the theoretical underpinnings of Raidar's effectiveness. Why exactly do LLMs exhibit this differential behavior during rewriting?

**Rating:** Strong accept.
