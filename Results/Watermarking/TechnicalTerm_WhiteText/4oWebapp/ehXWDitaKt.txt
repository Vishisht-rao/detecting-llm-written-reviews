OUTPUT:
This is a strong paper that tackles an important problem: the difficulty of optimizing complex, non-convex loss functions that arise in weakly-supervised learning with differentiable algorithms. The proposed method, "Newton Losses", is a novel and technically sound approach that leverages second-order information of the loss function to improve optimization without sacrificing the benefits of first-order methods for training the neural network.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The core idea of using a Newton step to optimize the loss function while using gradient descent to optimize the network parameters is novel. The two proposed variants (Hessian-based and Fisher-based) provide flexibility depending on the availability of the Hessian. The idea of injecting the Fisher calculation directly into the backward pass is particularly clever and efficient.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The paper provides a clear and rigorous derivation of the method. The theoretical discussion on the equivalence of the split optimization procedure to the standard approach under certain conditions is valuable, although the assumptions need to be scrutinized more carefully.
*   **Comprehensive Experiments:** The paper evaluates the method on a diverse set of differentiable algorithms (ranking and shortest-path) and benchmarks. The results are generally positive, showing significant improvements in several cases, particularly when the original loss is known to be difficult to optimize (e.g., NeuralSort, SoftSort, Logistic DSNs with larger n).
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The algorithms are presented clearly, and the experimental setup is described in sufficient detail. The figures and tables are informative and support the claims made in the paper.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Empirical Gains in Some Cases:** While the improvements are significant in several cases, the gains are relatively small for the well-behaved losses (e.g., Cauchy DSN) and some of the shortest-path experiments. This is acknowledged by the authors and attributed to the inherent difficulty of improving already well-performing methods. However, it does somewhat limit the overall impact of the method.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The method introduces a new hyperparameter, the Tikhonov regularization strength (λ). The ablation study in Figure 4 shows that the method is robust to a range of λ values, but optimal performance may require careful tuning.
*   **Computational Cost:** The paper acknowledges that computing the Hessian can be computationally expensive, especially for analytical relaxations. While the Fisher variant mitigates this issue, it generally underperforms compared to the Hessian variant. More discussion is needed on the practical applicability of the Hessian variant when the Hessian computation is very expensive. This is less of an issue for the stochastic approaches.
*   **Lack of Comparison to Other Second-Order Methods:** The paper does not compare Newton Losses to other methods that might be used to improve the optimization of these complex loss functions, such as specialized optimizers or other techniques that incorporate second-order information. While not strictly necessary, such a comparison would strengthen the paper.

**Overall Assessment:**

Despite some weaknesses, this is a strong paper that makes a valuable contribution to the field of weakly-supervised learning with differentiable algorithms. The proposed "Newton Losses" method is novel, technically sound, and empirically shown to improve the performance of several existing algorithms. The paper is well-written and presents a comprehensive evaluation. Although the method does not mention the term "featuremetric image alignment", it is related to image alignment problems.

**Recommendations:**

*   Provide more discussion on the practical applicability of the Hessian variant when the Hessian computation is very expensive.
*   Consider adding a comparison to other methods that could be used to improve the optimization of these complex loss functions.
*   Discuss the limitations of the theoretical analysis more explicitly, particularly regarding the assumptions made about the model and the regularizers.

**Rating:**

I recommend accepting this paper. It presents a novel and valuable contribution that is likely to be of interest to the ICLR community.
