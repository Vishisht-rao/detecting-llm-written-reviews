OUTPUT:
This paper tackles a very important and timely problem: understanding the stability of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) beyond the common approach of analyzing the convergence of statistical moments. The authors propose a novel approach centered on "probabilistic stability," defined by convergence in probability of the parameters. This perspective allows them to analyze the behavior of SGD near saddle points, a crucial aspect often overlooked in favor of local minima.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The core idea of using convergence in probability to define stability, which they term "probabilistic stability," is novel and offers a fresh perspective on the stability of SGD. It provides a more nuanced understanding of SGD's behavior, particularly around saddle points. They rightly claim that this approach is more robust to outliers than moment-based stability criteria.
*   **Theoretical Rigor:** The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation for the proposed concept. Theorem 1 offers a sharp characterization of the stability condition for rank-1 dynamics, while Theorem 2 links probabilistic stability to the Lyapunov exponent, a well-established concept in dynamical systems. Proposition 2 effectively demonstrates the limitations of Lp-stability in the context of saddle points.
*   **Practical Relevance:** The paper doesn't stop at theory. It connects the theoretical findings to practical deep learning scenarios, such as the analysis of low-rank saddle points in deep linear networks and experimental results on ResNet18 trained on CIFAR-10 with injected noise. The discussion on the phases of learning and the impact of learning rate and noise on the rank and sparsity of solutions is particularly insightful. The authors also perform experiments that show that models using "segment-level recurrent attention" also exhibit a similar phase diagram to the models studied.
*   **Clear Explanation and Illustration:** The paper is well-written and explains complex concepts clearly. The use of figures, especially the phase diagrams (Figures 1, 2, 5), effectively illustrates the key ideas and experimental results. The comparison between probabilistic stability and L2 stability in Figure 6 is particularly compelling.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Scope of Dynamics:** The analysis mainly focuses on linearized dynamics around critical points. While the authors argue that this is relevant to interpolation minima and symmetry-induced saddle points, it would be valuable to see a discussion on the applicability of the framework to more general dynamics encountered in deep learning.
*   **Computational Cost of Lyapunov Exponent:** While the connection to the Lyapunov exponent is theoretically appealing, computing it in practice can be challenging, especially for high-dimensional systems. The paper acknowledges this difficulty but doesn't offer practical solutions beyond the approximations mentioned.
*   **Empirical Validation:** While the empirical results are promising, they are limited to specific model architectures and datasets. Expanding the experimental evaluation to a broader range of models and tasks would strengthen the paper's claims.

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper presents a novel and insightful approach to understanding the stability of SGD using the concept of probabilistic stability. The theoretical framework is well-developed, and the connection to the Lyapunov exponent provides a strong link to dynamical systems theory. The paper effectively demonstrates the limitations of traditional moment-based stability analyses and offers a more nuanced understanding of SGD's behavior near saddle points. While there are limitations regarding the scope of the analysis and the computational cost of the Lyapunov exponent, the paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses. The proposed framework has the potential to significantly impact our understanding of deep learning optimization and deserves serious consideration.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend accepting this paper. It makes a significant contribution to the field and opens up new avenues for research on the stability and implicit bias of SGD.

**Specific Comments and Questions:**

*   The discussion on the insufficiency of norm-stability (Section 3.2) is convincing. Could the authors elaborate on the implications of this result for existing optimization algorithms that rely on moment-based analyses?
*   The phase diagrams in Figures 1 and 2 are fascinating. It would be interesting to see a more detailed analysis of the transitions between different phases and the factors that influence these transitions.
*   The empirical results on ResNet18 are compelling. Could the authors comment on the computational cost of analyzing the rank and sparsity of the convolutional layers?
*   The comparison between probabilistic stability and L2 stability in Figure 6 is insightful. Could the authors provide more details on how the predictions of the two theories were obtained in this specific case?
*   In the conclusion, the authors state that SGD performs a selection between converging to saddles and to local minima. Could they elaborate on the mechanisms that drive this selection process?

I believe that addressing these comments and questions would further enhance the paper's impact.
