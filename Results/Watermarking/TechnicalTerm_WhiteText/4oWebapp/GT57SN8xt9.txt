OUTPUT:
This paper introduces a novel method for posterior sampling and conditional generative modeling based on conditional flows of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) with a negative distance kernel. The authors provide a solid theoretical foundation for their method, demonstrating its advantages in terms of efficient computation and convergence properties. The empirical results on various tasks, including image generation and inverse problems, showcase the effectiveness and potential of the proposed approach.

**Strengths:**

1. **Strong Theoretical Contributions:** The paper makes significant theoretical contributions by establishing error bounds between the approximated joint distribution and the true posterior distribution within the MMD metric. This provides a theoretical justification for using conditional generative models for posterior sampling. Furthermore, the authors prove that their particle flow can be represented as a Wasserstein gradient flow of a modified MMD functional, which also provides a theoretical basis for the empirical method used in Du et al. (2023).
2. **Efficient Computation:** The use of MMD with a negative distance kernel, combined with slicing and sorting techniques, allows for efficient computation of the gradients, reducing the time complexity from O(N^2) to O(N log N) for measures with N support points. This makes the method scalable to high-dimensional problems.
3. **Comprehensive Numerical Experiments:** The paper presents a wide range of numerical experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method on various tasks, including class-conditional image generation, inpainting, super-resolution, and computed tomography. The experiments on high-dimensional inverse problems, such as super-resolution of materials' microstructures and limited-angle/low-dose CT, are particularly impressive. The authors provide comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, showing competitive or superior performance.
4. **Clear and Well-Structured Presentation:** The paper is well-written and logically structured. The authors clearly explain the motivation, theoretical background, and experimental setup. The use of figures and tables effectively illustrates the results and facilitates understanding.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Scalability Concerns:** While the method offers computational advantages compared to some alternatives, the scalability to very large datasets (e.g. "web-scale dataset") might still be a concern due to the particle interaction in the flow. Enabling batching to train the model could be a valuable future direction, as mentioned by the authors.
2. **Evaluation Metrics for Posterior Sampling:** As the authors acknowledge, evaluating the quality of posterior sampling algorithms in high dimensions is challenging due to the lack of meaningful metrics. The paper primarily relies on visual inspection and standard image quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM) for the mean images. Exploring alternative evaluation strategies for posterior sampling could further strengthen the empirical results.
3. **Practical Applicability of CT Experiments:** The authors acknowledge that their computed tomography experiments are not yet ready for clinical applications. The limitations regarding dataset availability, potential biases, and the need for retraining with different forward operators or noise models are appropriately discussed.

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper presents a novel and theoretically sound approach for posterior sampling based on conditional MMD flows. The authors provide strong theoretical guarantees and demonstrate the practical effectiveness of their method through comprehensive numerical experiments. While some limitations remain, particularly regarding scalability to extremely large datasets and the evaluation of posterior sampling, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of generative modeling and its application to inverse problems. The work opens up promising avenues for future research, such as exploring alternative kernels, investigating the mean-field limit of the particle flows, and developing more advanced evaluation metrics for posterior sampling.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend accepting this paper for publication at ICLR 2024. The paper's strong theoretical contributions, combined with its promising empirical results, make it a valuable addition to the conference.
