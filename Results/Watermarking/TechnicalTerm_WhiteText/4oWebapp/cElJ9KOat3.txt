OUTPUT:
This paper proposes a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method for learning coordinated agents under directed acyclic graph (DAG) constraints. The authors introduce a new approach called MARLM-SR, which utilizes synthetic rewards and a theoretical framework demonstrating that it optimizes a lower bound of the optimal value function. The practical algorithm introduces "leader" and "reward generator and distributor" (RGD) agents to guide "follower" agents in exploring the parameter space within DAG-constrained environments. The approach is evaluated on four DAG environments, including a real-world scheduling task, and shows promising results compared to non-DAG baselines.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty:** The paper tackles a relatively unexplored area of MARL by explicitly considering DAG constraints, which are common in real-world scenarios. The introduction of the leader and RGD agents, along with the concept of synthetic rewards tailored for DAG structures, is novel and potentially impactful. The theoretical foundation of optimizing a lower bound of the optimal value function using synthetic rewards adds rigor to the approach. The concept of a "movement primitives" like decomposition of a complex task is elegant and novel.
2. **Theoretical Grounding:** The authors provide a theoretical justification for their approach by proving that maximizing the proposed synthetic value function serves as a lower bound for the optimal value function. This theoretical analysis strengthens the paper's contribution and provides a solid foundation for the proposed method.
3. **Practical Algorithm:** The proposed training algorithm with leader and RGD agents is a practical solution for addressing the challenges of delayed rewards and complex dependencies in DAG environments. The concept of a goal period further refines the coordination between agents.
4. **Empirical Evaluation:** The paper includes experiments on three synthetic environments and a real-world scheduling task at an Intel factory. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over several baselines, including existing reward shaping methods adapted for the DAG setting. The ablation studies further validate the contribution of the individual components (leader and RGD).
5. **Clear Writing and Organization:** The paper is well-written and organized. The concepts are clearly explained, and the flow of the paper is logical. The use of figures and diagrams effectively illustrates the proposed approach and experimental results.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Real-World Evaluation:** While the paper includes a real-world scheduling task, it is limited to a single case study. Expanding the evaluation to more diverse real-world applications would strengthen the paper's claims of practicality and generalizability. Moreover, the details of the real-world environment are obscured for confidentiality.
2. **Scalability Concerns:** Although the paper claims scalability as a contribution, a more thorough analysis of the computational complexity and scalability of the proposed method, especially with increasing DAG complexity, would be beneficial.
3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The sensitivity analysis for the goal period length and goal vector dimension is appreciated. However, a more comprehensive analysis of the sensitivity to other hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, discount factor, and network architecture, could provide valuable insights into the robustness of the proposed method.
4. **Lack of Mathematical Justification for Synthetic Rewards:** The authors acknowledge the limitation of not providing a mathematical basis for whether the synthetic rewards obtained through their algorithm satisfy the conditions outlined in the modeling section. Addressing this gap would further strengthen the theoretical foundation of the work.
5. **Comparison with Other DAG-Specific Methods:** The paper claims that there are no existing MARL algorithms that can be used to coordinate multiple agents in a DAG. While this might be true, a more thorough discussion and comparison with potential alternative approaches, even if not directly applicable, would enhance the paper's contribution. For example, hierarchical reinforcement learning methods, which also decompose tasks into subtasks, could be discussed in the context of DAG constraints.
6. The notion of "movement primitives" is not well explored, which is a missed opportunity.

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper presents a novel and promising approach to MARL in DAG-constrained environments. The theoretical grounding, practical algorithm, and empirical evaluation make a strong case for the proposed method. However, addressing the limitations mentioned above, particularly regarding real-world evaluation, scalability, hyperparameter sensitivity, and a more comprehensive comparison with other potential approaches, would further enhance the paper's impact and strengthen its contributions to the field. Despite these weaknesses, the paper is a valuable contribution and is recommended for acceptance after addressing the raised concerns.
