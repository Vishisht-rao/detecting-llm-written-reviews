OUTPUT:
This paper introduces a novel and intriguing method for the self-supervised detection of perfect and partial input-dependent symmetries. The authors tackle a relevant problem in the field of equivariant neural networks, particularly the limitations of existing methods that either assume a uniform level of symmetry across the entire dataset or require supervised training. The proposed approach, which builds upon the Invariant-Equivariant Autoencoder (IE-AE), offers a promising solution for learning input-specific symmetry levels without labels.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The core idea of learning input-dependent symmetries in a self-supervised manner is novel and addresses a significant gap in the current literature. The derivation of a sufficient and necessary condition to learn the distribution of symmetries (Proposition 3.1) is a key theoretical contribution.
*   **Practicality:** The method demonstrates potential for practical applications, such as out-of-distribution symmetry detection and the generation of standardized datasets. The improvement in the performance of non-equivariant models (ResNet-18 and K-Means) on symmetry-standardized datasets is particularly noteworthy.
*   **Generalizability:** The framework is shown to be adaptable to different symmetry distributions beyond uniform distributions, including Gaussian and discrete cyclic symmetries. This flexibility enhances the applicability of the method to a wider range of scenarios.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed method, including the theoretical underpinnings, the training procedure, and the experimental setup. The figures and tables are informative and support the claims made in the paper.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Scope of Symmetry Distributions:** The main limitation, acknowledged by the authors, is the restriction to unimodal and symmetric distributions. Extending the method to handle multimodal or asymmetric distributions would significantly broaden its applicability.
*   **Dependence on IE-AE:** The method relies on the ability of the IE-AE to capture the relationship between objects within the same class through group actions. This dependence can be problematic in datasets with high intra-class variability, as noted in the limitations section. Using more semantically meaningful metrics beyond MSE could potentially mitigate this issue.
*   **Lack of Comparison to Other Methods:** The paper does not include comparisons with other unsupervised or self-supervised methods for learning symmetries or invariant representations. It would be beneficial to benchmark the proposed method against existing approaches, even if they are not directly comparable in terms of learning input-dependent symmetries. The authors mention "benchmark evaluation" but do not include it.
*   **Dataset Limitations:** The experiments are primarily conducted on variations of the MNIST dataset. While these datasets are suitable for demonstrating the core concepts, evaluating the method on more complex, real-world datasets (e.g., CIFAR10, as mentioned in the limitations) would provide a more comprehensive assessment of its performance.

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of equivariant neural networks and unsupervised representation learning. The proposed method for self-supervised detection of input-dependent symmetries is novel, theoretically sound, and demonstrates practical potential. While there are limitations related to the scope of symmetry distributions and the dependence on IE-AE, the authors acknowledge these challenges and suggest avenues for future research. With further development and evaluation on more complex datasets, this method could become a powerful tool for learning robust and generalizable representations.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

*   Explore methods for handling multimodal or asymmetric symmetry distributions.
*   Investigate the use of alternative metrics beyond MSE to improve the robustness of the IE-AE component.
*   Include a "benchmark evaluation" and comparisons with other relevant unsupervised or self-supervised methods.
*   Evaluate the method on more complex, real-world datasets.
*   Provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed method compared to other approaches.

**Final Recommendation:**

Despite the weaknesses mentioned above, the paper's novelty, theoretical contributions, and practical potential warrant acceptance. I recommend accepting the paper after addressing the raised concerns and incorporating the suggested improvements.
