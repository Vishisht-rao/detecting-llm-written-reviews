OUTPUT:
This paper introduces EasyTPP, a new open-source benchmark for Temporal Point Processes (TPPs). The authors position EasyTPP as a timely and much-needed contribution to the field, given the rapid growth in TPP research and the lack of a standardized framework for evaluation and comparison of models.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses a critical need:** The paper convincingly argues for the need for a centralized benchmark in the TPP field. The lack of standardization has indeed been a hindrance to progress, making it difficult to compare models and reproduce results.
*   **Comprehensive and well-designed:** EasyTPP appears to be a comprehensive framework, encompassing datasets, models, evaluation metrics, and hyperparameter tuning tools. The design choices, such as supporting both PyTorch and TensorFlow, are well-justified and contribute to the benchmark's flexibility and extensibility.
*   **Thorough experimental evaluation:** The authors conducted extensive experiments on multiple datasets using various models, providing a solid baseline for future research. The inclusion of a long-horizon prediction task is a valuable addition, offering a more nuanced evaluation of model performance.
*   **Focus on reproducibility and ease of use:** The emphasis on providing a unified interface, detailed documentation, and modular design is commendable. This will undoubtedly lower the barrier to entry for researchers and practitioners interested in TPPs.
*   **Clear and well-written:** The paper is well-organized, easy to follow, and clearly explains the technical details of EasyTPP. The use of figures and tables effectively illustrates the key concepts and experimental results.
*   **Open-source and community-driven:** By making the code and data publicly available, the authors encourage community involvement and future development of the benchmark.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited novelty in terms of models:** While the benchmark itself is novel, the models evaluated are mostly existing ones. This is understandable given the focus on benchmarking, but it would have been interesting to see at least one new model introduced or explored.
*   **Discussion of limitations could be expanded:** The paper briefly touches upon challenges like disjoint event types and different time scales in the context of foundation models. A more in-depth discussion of these limitations and potential solutions would have been beneficial. The mention of the "cubic newton method" was not present in the paper, thus I have not included it in the review.
*   **Performance saturation:** The authors acknowledge the issue of performance saturation on existing datasets. While they propose future research directions, a more detailed analysis of this problem and its implications would have strengthened the paper.

**Overall Assessment:**

EasyTPP is a significant contribution to the field of temporal point processes. It provides a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners, promoting reproducible research and facilitating the development of new models. The authors have done an excellent job of designing and implementing a comprehensive and user-friendly benchmark. While there is room for further development and exploration, EasyTPP is poised to become a standard tool in the TPP community.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Encourage the community to contribute new models and datasets to the benchmark.**
*   **Further investigate the challenges of building foundation models for event sequences.**
*   **Explore the use of EasyTPP in conjunction with external information sources and real-world interventions.**

**Rating:** I would strongly recommend accepting this paper. It is a timely, well-executed, and impactful contribution to the field.
