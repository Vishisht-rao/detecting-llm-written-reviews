OUTPUT:
This paper introduces a novel contribution valuation metric for vertical federated learning (VFL) called the "vertical federated Shapley value" (VerFedSV). It addresses the crucial problem of fairly assessing and incentivizing data owners in VFL scenarios, where participants have the same sample IDs but different feature sets. The authors build upon the well-established Shapley value from cooperative game theory, adapting it to the unique challenges of VFL.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Relevance:** The paper addresses a significant and timely problem in the field of federated learning. Fair contribution valuation is essential for the practical adoption and long-term success of VFL, particularly in settings with heterogeneous data and computational resources. The proposed VerFedSV is a novel approach tailored to VFL, extending previous work on Shapley value adaptations for horizontal federated learning.
2. **Theoretical Grounding:** The authors provide a strong theoretical foundation for VerFedSV. They demonstrate that it satisfies important fairness properties, including symmetry, zero element, additivity, and balance (Theorem 1). This theoretical analysis lends credibility to the proposed metric.
3. **Adaptability to Synchronous and Asynchronous Settings:** A major strength of the paper is its consideration of both synchronous and asynchronous VFL algorithms. The authors show how VerFedSV can be computed efficiently in both settings. This adaptability is crucial for real-world applications, where clients may have varying computational capabilities and network conditions. The paper includes a proposition that "more work leads to more rewards" (proposition 3) and claims that the "decoupled probabilistic modeling" that is done in the asynchronous setting ensures this is the case.
4. **Efficiency Considerations:** The authors acknowledge the computational challenges associated with Shapley value calculations and propose solutions for efficient approximation. In the synchronous setting, they leverage the low-rank nature of embedding matrices and employ matrix completion techniques. In the asynchronous setting, they show that VerFedSV can be computed directly without matrix completion. They also discuss the use of Monte Carlo sampling to further reduce computational costs.
5. **Empirical Validation:** The paper includes extensive experiments on four real-world datasets. The results demonstrate the fairness, efficiency, and effectiveness of VerFedSV. The experiments cover both synchronous and asynchronous settings and show that VerFedSV can accurately reflect the importance of clients' features and their communication frequencies.
6. **Clear and Well-Structured Presentation:** The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The authors clearly explain the concepts, methodology, and theoretical results. The experimental setup and results are also presented in a clear and concise manner.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Scalability:** While the authors discuss computational efficiency and provide an analysis of time complexity, the experiments are conducted with a relatively small number of clients (e.g., 8, 20, 14, 19 in different experiments). The scalability of VerFedSV to scenarios with a much larger number of clients remains to be explored. The matrix completion approach in the synchronous setting might become a bottleneck for very large-scale VFL.
2. **Dependency on Matrix Completion:** In the synchronous setting, the accuracy of VerFedSV relies on the effectiveness of the matrix completion algorithm. Although the authors provide an approximation guarantee (Proposition 2), the performance of matrix completion can be sensitive to hyperparameter settings (rank parameter r and regularization parameter Î»). While an ablation study is provided, further investigation into the robustness of VerFedSV to different matrix completion methods and hyperparameter choices would be beneficial.
3. **Lack of Comparison with Other VFL Contribution Valuation Methods:** The paper primarily compares VerFedSV with SHAP, which is not directly applicable to VFL. A more comprehensive comparison with other existing VFL contribution valuation methods (e.g., those based on conditional mutual information or situational importance mentioned in the related work section) would strengthen the evaluation of VerFedSV.

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of federated learning. The proposed VerFedSV is a novel, theoretically sound, and practically efficient metric for fair contribution valuation in VFL. The adaptability to both synchronous and asynchronous settings is a major strength. While there are some limitations regarding scalability and dependency on matrix completion in the synchronous setting, the paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses. The thorough theoretical analysis, extensive experiments, and clear presentation make this a valuable addition to the literature. This paper is likely to be of interest to researchers and practitioners working on federated learning, particularly those focused on VFL and fairness issues.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. Conduct experiments with a larger number of clients to evaluate the scalability of VerFedSV.
2. Explore the robustness of VerFedSV to different matrix completion methods and hyperparameter settings in the synchronous setting.
3. Provide a more comprehensive comparison with other VFL contribution valuation methods.
4. Investigate the potential integration of VerFedSV with differentially private VFL algorithms.
5. Address the "cheating" scenario mentioned in the conclusion, where clients might create new clients with identical features to receive unjustifiable rewards.

**Score:**  I would recommend accepting this paper. It addresses an important problem with a novel and well-justified solution. The theoretical and empirical results are strong, and the paper is well-written and easy to understand. While there is room for further improvement, the overall contribution is significant and timely.
