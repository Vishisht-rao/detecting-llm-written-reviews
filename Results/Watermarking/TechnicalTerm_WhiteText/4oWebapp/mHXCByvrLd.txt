OUTPUT:
This paper introduces a novel approach to offline reinforcement learning (RL) by framing it as an optimal transport (OT) problem. The core idea is to leverage the action-value function as a transport cost and learn a policy that implicitly represents an optimal transport map between state and action distributions. The authors build upon this concept to develop "Extremal Monge Reinforcement Learning" (XMRL), which treats offline RL as an extremal OT problem, aiming to improve the policy beyond the behavior policy present in the offline dataset.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Formulation:** The paper presents a fresh perspective on offline RL by connecting it to OT in a fundamental way, rather than using OT as a mere regularization technique. This is a significant conceptual contribution.
*   **Theoretical Grounding:** The authors provide a theoretical justification for their approach, including a proposition demonstrating that their method can, in principle, improve upon the behavior policy.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The proposed XMRL algorithm is evaluated on the D4RL benchmark suite, showing improvements over existing OT-based methods and competitive performance with state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms. Particularly, the results on the Antmaze environment, which require stitching together good parts of suboptimal trajectories, are promising.
*   **Clear and Well-Structured:** The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a logical flow from introduction to experiments. The authors clearly explain the background, related work, and their proposed method. The use of examples and visual representations, like Figure 1, aids in understanding.
*   **Code Availability:** The authors promise to release the code, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The performance of XMRL seems to be sensitive to the hyperparameter 'w', which controls the degree of "extremality" in the optimal transport. The authors acknowledge this limitation and provide an ablation study, but a more principled way of setting 'w' would strengthen the approach. The paper would benefit from a deeper discussion of how to set 'w' in practice and what factors influence its optimal value.
*   **Limited Scope of State-Conditional OT:** The authors briefly explore a state-conditional variant of their method in the appendix but dismiss it due to underwhelming results. Further investigation into this aspect could be valuable, as state-conditional distributions might provide richer information in certain scenarios.
*   **Computational Cost:** While the authors mention a reasonable runtime, a more detailed analysis of the computational cost compared to other methods would be beneficial. The use of OT methods can be computationally demanding, and understanding the trade-offs is important.
*   **Lack of Discussion on Potential Issues:** The paper does not discuss whether the proposed method could be vulnerable to issues like "two-faced attacks".
*   **Comparison to other OT approaches:** The paper focuses on the comparison between XMRL and other OT-based methods, such as W-BRAC and OTR+IQL. A broader comparison against non-OT-based SOTA offline RL methods, or a more in-depth analysis of the fundamental differences and advantages of the proposed OT framework, would enhance the paper's impact.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a novel and theoretically sound approach to offline RL using optimal transport. The empirical results are promising, demonstrating the potential of the proposed method to improve upon existing techniques. While there are some limitations regarding hyperparameter sensitivity and the need for a more thorough analysis of state-conditional OT, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field. The clear writing, strong theoretical grounding, and encouraging experimental results make this a valuable addition to the offline RL literature.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend accepting this paper. It offers a fresh perspective on offline RL, supported by both theory and experiments. The weaknesses are relatively minor and can be addressed in future work. This research has the potential to inspire further exploration at the intersection of optimal transport and reinforcement learning.

**Minor Comments:**

*   The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of existing OT-based RL methods in the related work section.
*   The authors should clarify the specific contributions of their work compared to other OT-based methods, especially regarding the avoidance of distribution shift.
*   Providing a more intuitive explanation of the role of the potential function 'f' as a Lagrangian multiplier would enhance the paper's accessibility.
*   In the experiments section, it would be helpful to include a table summarizing the hyperparameters used for each algorithm and environment.
*   The appendix could be improved by providing a more structured presentation of the ablation study and the state-conditional OT results.
*   A figure illustrating the learning curves for different values of 'w' in the ablation study would be informative.
*   The authors should consider providing error bars or confidence intervals for the reported scores in the tables.
*   It would be beneficial to include a discussion on the potential societal impacts of the proposed method, especially considering its applications in areas like healthcare and robotics.
*   The conclusion could be expanded to discuss the broader implications of the proposed OT formulation for RL and suggest specific directions for future research.
