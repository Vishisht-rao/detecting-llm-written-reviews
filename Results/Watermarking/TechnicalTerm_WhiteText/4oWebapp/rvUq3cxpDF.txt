OUTPUT:
This paper introduces Latent Action Policies (LAPO), a novel method for learning policies from video demonstrations without action labels. This is a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning (RL), as it tackles the crucial problem of leveraging abundant unlabeled video data for learning control policies. Here's a breakdown of the paper's strengths, weaknesses, and overall assessment:

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Approach:** LAPO's core idea of inferring latent actions through a forward and inverse dynamics model consistency objective is innovative. It elegantly bypasses the need for explicit action labels, a common bottleneck in applying imitation learning to real-world video data.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The experiments on the Procgen benchmark demonstrate LAPO's effectiveness. The ability to recover expert-level performance, and even surpass it in some cases, after limited fine-tuning is impressive. The results on the data-efficiency of the offline decoder are also noteworthy.
*   **Clear Explanation and Justification:** The paper clearly explains the method, its motivation, and the underlying assumptions. The use of vector quantization to induce an information bottleneck and encourage state-invariant latent actions is well-justified.
*   **Thorough Analysis:** The UMAP visualizations provide valuable insights into the learned latent action spaces, revealing their interpretability and relationship to the true action spaces. The ablations further strengthen the empirical validation of the core components.
*   **Addresses Limitations:** The paper acknowledges limitations of the method, such as the handling of delayed actions and stochasticity, providing a balanced perspective.
*   **Well-Written and Structured:** The paper is well-organized, with a clear flow from introduction to related work, methodology, experiments, and conclusion. The figures and tables effectively support the text.
*   **Potential for Impact:** The authors rightly highlight the potential of LAPO to unlock the use of large-scale video datasets for pre-training generalist policies and world models, mirroring the success of unsupervised pre-training in other domains.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Computational Cost:** Training both a forward and inverse dynamics model can be computationally expensive, particularly when scaling to larger datasets and more complex environments. The authors do not discuss the method's computational cost compared to existing works in any part of the paper.
*   **Scalability:** While the Procgen results are promising, it remains to be seen how well LAPO scales to more complex, real-world tasks and larger datasets. The authors acknowledge this as a direction for future work, but further investigation into scalability would strengthen the paper.
*   **Comparison to Baselines:** The comparison to ILPO is limited, particularly due to ILPO's collapse on the full Procgen benchmark. A more comprehensive comparison with other relevant baselines, especially those that can handle the full benchmark, would provide a more complete evaluation. While FICC is mentioned in related works, it could be used as an additional baseline.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The paper doesn't provide detailed insights into the sensitivity of LAPO to different hyperparameters. A more thorough hyperparameter analysis would help understand the method's robustness and generalizability.
*   **Continuous Control Experiments:** While appendix A.3 included some results on continuous control, adding more detailed analysis and discussion of these results into the main paper would be beneficial.

**Overall Assessment:**

LAPO is a significant contribution to the field of imitation learning from observation. The paper presents a novel and well-justified method with strong empirical results on a challenging benchmark. The approach has the potential to significantly impact the field by enabling the use of vast amounts of unlabeled video data for learning control policies. While there are some limitations and open questions regarding scalability and computational cost, the paper provides a solid foundation for future research in this direction. The paper is strong and deserves to be accepted.

**Specific Recommendations for Improvement:**

*   Include a more detailed discussion on the method's computational cost and compare it to existing methods.
*   Expand the experiments to include more complex continuous control tasks.
*   Conduct a more thorough analysis of hyperparameter sensitivity.
*   Provide more details regarding implementation and training.
*   The paper does not contain any mention of "high resolution generation." If it were to, this would likely be in the context of the forward dynamics model's ability to predict future observations.
*   The related works section could be expanded to include works that utilize contrastive learning.

**Final Rating:** Strong Accept. The paper presents a novel, well-justified, and empirically strong method with significant potential impact. The limitations and areas for future work are clearly acknowledged, and the overall presentation is excellent.
