Okay, here is a review of the paper "State-driven Implicit Modeling" submitted to ICLR 2024:

**Review of "State-driven Implicit Modeling"**

**Summary:**

This paper introduces a novel approach to training implicit neural network models called State-driven Implicit Modeling (SIM). The core idea is to circumvent the computationally expensive backward pass typically required for implicit models by instead constraining the internal states and outputs of the implicit model to match those of a pre-existing "baseline" model (either a standard layered network or another implicit model). This matching is formulated as a convex optimization problem, which, under certain conditions, can be solved efficiently and in a parallel fashion. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of SIM for two tasks: parameter reduction and improving robustness to adversarial examples.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty:** The proposed SIM framework is a novel and interesting approach to training implicit models. By leveraging the states of a baseline model, it avoids the complexities of implicit differentiation, a major hurdle in training implicit models.
2. **Convexity and Parallelism:** The formulation of the training problem as a convex optimization problem is a significant advantage. This allows for efficient optimization and, importantly, parallelization, which can greatly reduce training time. Although not mentioned, the nature of this approach would seem to easily lend itself to federated learning settings.
3. **Flexibility:** The authors show how the SIM framework can be adapted to different objectives, such as sparsity (parameter reduction) and robustness, by modifying the objective function. This flexibility makes SIM a potentially valuable tool for various applications.
4. **Empirical Results:** The experiments on parameter reduction (CIFAR-100, 20NewsGroup) and robustness (FashionMNIST) are encouraging. The results for parameter reduction, particularly using the perspective relaxation, demonstrate significant reductions in the number of parameters with minimal or no loss in accuracy. The comparison with other parameter reduction methods on CIFAR-100 is also favorable. The robustness experiments show that the `1`-norm regularization within the SIM framework can enhance robustness against adversarial attacks.
5. **Reduced Data Dependency**: The results suggest that using a much smaller fraction of the training dataset (20-30%) is enough to effectively train an implicit model, especially for parameter reduction.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Scope of Experiments:** While the experiments are promising, they are somewhat limited in scope. Evaluating SIM on a wider range of datasets and tasks would strengthen the paper. For instance, the robustness experiments are only conducted on FashionMNIST, and it would be valuable to see results on more complex datasets. Further, it would be interesting to see if other optimization-based objectives could be combined with this framework (e.g., a "heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic" objective).
2. **Dependence on Baseline Model:** The performance of SIM is inherently tied to the quality of the baseline model. If the baseline model is poor, the resulting implicit model may also be suboptimal. This dependency should be discussed more explicitly.
3. **Theoretical Analysis:** While the paper provides a good intuitive explanation of SIM, a more rigorous theoretical analysis of the framework's properties (e.g., convergence, generalization) would be beneficial.
4. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The performance of SIM likely depends on the choice of hyperparameters (e.g., , 1, 2). A more thorough investigation of the sensitivity to these hyperparameters would be helpful.
5. **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is mostly well-written, but some sections could be clarified. For example, a more detailed discussion of the relationship between the proposed method and existing techniques for pruning and improving the robustness of neural networks would be useful. Algorithm 1 would also benefit from pseudocode describing the optimization problems being solved.

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper presents a novel and promising approach to training implicit models. The SIM framework offers several advantages, including convexity, parallelism, and flexibility. The empirical results are encouraging, demonstrating the potential of SIM for parameter reduction and improving robustness. However, the paper could be strengthened by expanding the scope of the experiments, providing a more rigorous theoretical analysis, and improving the clarity of certain sections.

**Recommendation:**

Despite the weaknesses mentioned above, I believe this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of implicit models and has the potential to be impactful. I recommend acceptance, but encourage the authors to address the points raised in this review to further improve the paper.

**Rating:**  7/10 (Accept)
