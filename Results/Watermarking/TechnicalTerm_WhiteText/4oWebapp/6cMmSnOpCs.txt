OUTPUT:
This paper introduces S CALEARN , a novel and highly parameter-efficient two-stage multi-task learning (MTL) method. It focuses on scaling the output representations of source adapters for effective knowledge transfer to a target task. The paper is well-written, well-organized, and presents a compelling argument for the proposed approach. Here's a detailed review:

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** S CALEARN introduces a simple yet effective approach to two-stage MTL, addressing the significant parameter overhead of existing methods like AdapterFusion. The idea of learning scaling parameters for adapter outputs is novel and demonstrates strong potential for efficient task transfer.
*   **Parameter Efficiency:** The core strength of S CALEARN lies in its parameter efficiency. Compared to AdapterFusion and joint MTL methods, S CALEARN dramatically reduces the number of trainable parameters, particularly in its S CALEARN UNIFORM ++ variant. This efficiency makes it attractive for resource-constrained environments and aligns well with the goals of Green AI.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The paper presents extensive experiments on three diverse benchmarks (GLUE, SuperGLUE, and HumSet) using RoBERTa (BASE and LARGE) and XLM-R (BASE and LARGE). S CALEARN consistently outperforms strong baselines, including joint MTL and two-stage MTL methods, demonstrating its effectiveness across a range of tasks and domains. The few-shot learning experiments further highlight its ability to generalize well with limited data.
*   **Thorough Analysis:** The paper provides a solid motivation for the proposed approach through preliminary experiments analyzing the effect of scaling output representations. The ablation study (Appendix A.3) and scaling coefficient visualizations (Appendix A.5) offer valuable insights into the inner workings of S CALEARN . The inclusion of standard deviations in the results enhances the credibility of the findings. The paper also mentions that "substructures" are not in the paper.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors commit to releasing their code, and the experimental setup is described in detail, including hyperparameters and dataset splits (Section 5 and Appendix A.1). This commitment to reproducibility is commendable and crucial for the advancement of the field.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Theoretical Analysis:** While the empirical results are strong, the paper could benefit from a more in-depth theoretical analysis of why scaling works so effectively for task transfer. Exploring the relationship between scaling coefficients and task relatedness or the "substructures" of the adapters could provide further insights.
*   **Adapter Choice:** The paper primarily focuses on Pfeiffer adapters (Houlsby et al., 2019) for the task learning layer. While this is a reasonable choice, exploring the applicability of S CALEARN to other parameter-efficient modules (e.g., LoRA, Compacter) could broaden its impact and demonstrate its generalizability.
*   **Task Selection in Joint MTL:** The paper argues that two-stage MTL methods are less sensitive to task selection than joint MTL. While this is supported by some of the results (especially on SuperGLUE and HumSet), a more direct comparison focusing specifically on task selection strategies could strengthen this claim.
*   **Computational Cost:** Although S CALEARN is parameter-efficient, the paper doesn't explicitly discuss its computational cost during training and inference compared to other methods. Providing such an analysis would complete the picture of its overall efficiency.
*   **Initialization of Scaling Parameters:** Appendix A.1 mentions that the scaling parameters are initialized with N(2, 0.001). It would be beneficial to discuss the rationale behind this specific initialization and explore the sensitivity of the model to different initialization strategies.
* **Discussion of Limitations:** The paper could benefit from a dedicated section discussing the limitations of the proposed approach, such as scenarios where it might not be as effective (e.g., tasks requiring complex interactions beyond linear scaling).

**Overall Assessment:**

S CALEARN is a significant contribution to the field of multi-task learning, offering a simple yet powerful method for efficient task transfer. The paper's strengths, including its novelty, parameter efficiency, strong empirical results, and commitment to reproducibility, outweigh its minor weaknesses. The proposed approach has the potential to advance the development of more sustainable and adaptable NLP models. I recommend accepting this paper.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

*   Provide a more in-depth theoretical analysis of the scaling mechanism.
*   Experiment with different types of adapters in the task learning layer.
*   Include a direct comparison of task selection strategies between joint and two-stage MTL.
*   Analyze the computational cost of S CALEARN during training and inference.
*   Discuss the rationale behind the initialization of scaling parameters and explore its sensitivity.
*   Add a dedicated section discussing the limitations of the proposed approach.

By addressing these points, the authors can further strengthen the paper and increase its impact on the research community.
