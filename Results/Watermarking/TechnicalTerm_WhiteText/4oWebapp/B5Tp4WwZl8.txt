OUTPUT:
This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of distributed optimization by providing the first theoretical proof that gradient descent (GD) with TopK sparsification and error feedback (EF21) can outperform vanilla GD in terms of communication complexity. This is a notable achievement, as it addresses a long-standing open problem in the area of communication-efficient distributed learning.

Here's a breakdown of the paper's strengths and weaknesses:

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Theoretical Result:** The core strength lies in the novel theoretical analysis demonstrating that EF21 can beat GD when features are rare, characterized by a small 'c' value (maximal number of clients owning any feature). This is formalized in Theorem 2, which establishes an improved communication complexity bound for EF21 under specific sparsity conditions. The introduction of the parameter 'c' and the L+ constant, alongside refined analysis techniques, is a key advancement. Notably the authors derive a communication complexity bound of O((L+r*L+*sqrt(c/n))*(1/epsilon)) for EF21 with Top1 compressor, which is better than the standard GD bound of O(r*L*(1/epsilon)) when L+*sqrt(c/n) <= L.
*   **Clear Motivation and Problem Definition:** The paper clearly articulates the motivation behind the work, highlighting the discrepancy between the practical effectiveness of EF21 and its theoretical limitations compared to GD. The observations about EF21's performance in practice, its theoretical equivalence to GD under certain conditions, and its lack of scaling in homogeneous data regimes are well-presented and provide a strong rationale for the research.
*   **Rigorous Analysis:** The authors provide a detailed and rigorous theoretical analysis of EF21, building upon the original work by RichtÃ¡rik et al. (2021). The lemmas and theorem are well-supported, and the proof techniques are sound. The refinement of the average smoothness assumption and the introduction of the sparsity parameter 'c' into the analysis are particularly noteworthy.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The paper includes experimental results on linear regression with sparse data and logistic regression with an adaptive stepsize that support the theoretical findings. The experiments are carefully designed to demonstrate the impact of the sparsity parameter 'c' on the convergence behavior of EF21. They clearly show that the performance gap between EF21 with standard and new stepsizes is significant when 'c' is small, and negligible when 'c' is close to 'n'.
*   **Well-Structured and Written:** The paper is well-structured and easy to follow. The authors use clear language and provide sufficient background information to make the work accessible to a broad audience. The use of examples and illustrations further enhances the clarity of the exposition.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Practical Applicability (Acknowledged by Authors):**  The authors acknowledge that the practical impact of their results might be limited because many real-world datasets are not sparse enough to have a significantly small c/n ratio. Furthermore, the complex architecture of deep neural networks often leads to non-zero weights, increasing the value of 'c'.
*   **Strong Assumptions:** The analysis relies on several assumptions, including the smoothness of the loss functions and the existence of a lower bound on the function values. While these are common assumptions in optimization, they may not always hold in practice.
*   **Toy Experiments:** While the experiments provide valuable insights, they are conducted on relatively simple models (linear and logistic regression). Further experiments on more complex models and datasets would be beneficial to demonstrate the broader applicability of the theoretical results.
*   **Heuristic Adaptive Stepsize:** The adaptive stepsize used in the logistic regression experiments is heuristically defined and lacks theoretical justification. While it shows promising results, a more rigorous analysis of its convergence properties would be desirable. The method for computing 'ct' is also not practical as it requires the computation of the full gradient.

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper represents a significant step forward in our understanding of error feedback mechanisms in distributed optimization. The authors have identified a specific regime ("rare features") where EF21 provably outperforms GD in terms of communication complexity. This is a valuable theoretical contribution that opens up new avenues for research in communication-efficient distributed learning. While the practical applicability of the results might be limited due to the sparsity requirements, the paper provides a strong foundation for further advancements in the field. The paper does not mention the term "neyman-pearson". The theoretical analysis is sound and well-supported by experiments, making this a strong submission that deserves to be accepted.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

*   Further investigation into the adaptive stepsize mechanism, including a theoretical analysis of its convergence properties.
*   Exploration of alternative definitions of sparsity that might be more applicable to real-world datasets and deep learning models.
*   Additional experiments on more complex models and datasets to further validate the theoretical findings.
*   Consideration of alternative contractive compressors beyond TopK.

This paper provides valuable new insights that could lead to the development of more efficient distributed learning algorithms, especially in scenarios with specific data sparsity patterns.
