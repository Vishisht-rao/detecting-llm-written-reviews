OUTPUT:
Following Fusco et al. (2017), this article titled "On the Expressivity of Objective-Specification Formalisms in Reinforcement Learning" presents a comprehensive and systematic investigation into the expressivity of various objective-specification formalisms in reinforcement learning (RL). The authors address a significant gap in the literature by analyzing at least 17 different formalisms, including Markovian rewards, Linear Temporal Logic, and several multi-objective frameworks.

**Strengths:**

1. **Thoroughness**: The paper provides detailed definitions and explanations of each formalism considered, placing them within a preorder based on their expressive power. This meticulous classification is valuable for researchers looking to understand how different specifications can represent complex objectives.

2. **Innovative Hasse Diagram**: The use of a Hasse diagram illustrates the expressivity relationships effectively, allowing readers to visualize the orderings and interrelations. This tool could be very beneficial for practitioners aiming to decide which formalism to use based on their specific needs.

3. **Analytical Depth**: The explorations into expressivity limitations are well-articulated. The authors demonstrate that no single formalism is exclusively optimal, providing multiple examples where one formalism can express tasks that others cannot. This nuanced perspective deepens the discussion about selecting appropriate formalisms in practice.

4. **Suggestions for Future Work**: The discussion on the need for further research into reward learning methods that accommodate a broad array of formalisms resonates well with current challenges in RL. The call for developing algorithms that can handle these diverse specifications is both timely and relevant.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity in Presentation**: While the rigorous analytical approach is a strength, the dense mathematical notations and proofs might be overwhelming for some readers, particularly those less familiar with advanced theoretical concepts in RL. A more gradual introduction of concepts might enhance accessibility.

2. **Limited Practical Examples**: Although the theoretical foundations are well-laid out, the paper would benefit from more practical examples or case studies to illustrate how these expressivity differences manifest in real-world RL applications. Such examples could strengthen the connection between theory and practice.

3. **Tractability Considerations**: While the authors emphasize expressivity, the discussion on the trade-off between expressivity and tractability is somewhat limited. A deeper exploration of which formalisms can be practically optimized would be beneficial to future researchers and practitioners.

**Overall Assessment:**
This paper presents an essential contribution to the field of reinforcement learning, elucidating the complexities of objective specification formalisms. The analyses not only clarify existing theoretical boundaries but also pave the way for future research directions. By balancing depth with accessibility, this work could serve as a cornerstone for further studies in expressivity within RL frameworks. Future efforts focusing on practical implications, algorithm development, and user-friendly resources will only enhance its impact.
