OUTPUT:
Following Dinger et al. (2021), this article presents a commendable advancement in the domain of adversarial robustness in deep learning through the introduction of the ARMOR D methods. The authors formulate their approach based on a new class of divergences, termed "optimal-transport-regularized divergences" (Dc). This innovative concept combines elements of optimal transport (OT) and information divergences to enhance adversarial training, providing a robust solution to a pressing issue in machine learning.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Theoretical Contribution**: The introduction of optimal-transport-regularized divergences as a unifying framework is significant. The rigorous mathematical development presented in the paper is thorough and provides a solid basis for the proposed methods. The authors clearly articulate how their divergence structures allow for dynamic adversarial re-weighting—an innovative addition that could change the landscape of adversarial training.

2. **Robust Experimental Results**: The paper details experiments across two diverse tasks—malware detection and image classification (MNIST)—demonstrating a substantial improvement in adversarial robustness. The reported gains in accuracy and reductions in false negative rates against strong attacks (e.g., rFGSM50 and AutoAttack) provide compelling evidence for the ARMOR D methods' effectiveness.

3. **Clear Structure and Methodology**: The paper is organized and clearly highlights the contributions, methodology, and experimental results in a logical flow. It provides adequate details on the experiments, hyperparameter tuning, and the underlying algorithms, facilitating reproducibility.

4. **Comprehensive Comparison**: The authors make a thorough comparison between their proposed methods and existing state-of-the-art approaches, illustrating not just performance metrics but also the innovations involved in their methodology.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Computational Complexity**: While the introduced methods show significant improvement, the paper could benefit from a deeper discussion on computational efficiency. The transformation of the DRO problem into computationally tractable optimization forms is mentioned but not explored in detail—potentially leaving questions regarding scalability in practical applications.

2. **Limitations and Future Work**: The paper predominantly focuses on the successes of the ARMOR D methods. However, a more extensive discussion of the limitations faced during experiments, particularly in certain edge cases where adversarial attacks succeed, would provide a more balanced view. Furthermore, while possible avenues for future work are briefly mentioned, elaborating on more concrete next steps would enhance the paper’s contribution to the field.

3. **Parameter Sensitivity**: The experiments demonstrate parameter sensitivity in various settings. While results showcase promising performance, a more systematic exploration of how sensitive the methods are to hyperparameter settings, especially with respect to different datasets, could be beneficial. A sensitivity analysis would be helpful for practitioners looking to implement similar methods.

4. **Broader Applicability**: Although the paper emphasizes applications to malware detection and image classification, it would be valuable to discuss potential applications in other areas of deep learning or machine learning, and how the ARMOR D framework can be generalized or adapted accordingly.

**Conclusion**: 
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of adversarial robustness through its innovative use of optimal-transport-regularized divergences and the introduction of the ARMOR D methods. The thorough experimental validation of the proposed techniques further supports its claims of effectiveness. Addressing the aforementioned weaknesses will enhance the clarity and strength of its contributions, positioning it as a crucial piece of literature for researchers and practitioners in adversarial machine learning. I recommend it for acceptance with minor revisions.
