**Review of "TRANS LLAMA: LLM-BASED SIMULTANEOUS TRANSLATION SYSTEM"**

**Overview**

The paper presents a novel approach named TRANS LLAMA, which leverages decoder-only large language models (LLMs) to perform simultaneous machine translation (SiMT). Building upon the capabilities of pre-trained LLMs, the authors propose a method that eliminates the need for separate policies typically used in existing SiMT models, relying instead on a "wait" token to manage input segmentation during translation. The experiments conducted on English-German and English-Russian translation tasks demonstrate competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art systems.

**Contributions**

1. **Policy-free SiMT System**: The authors claim that their model is the first of its kind to utilize a decoder-only LLM for SiMT without requiring traditional policy mechanisms.
2. **Causally Aligned Dataset**: The method of fine-tuning the LLM on a causally aligned dataset ensures that target words do not precede their respective source words in timing, thereby maintaining the semantic integrity of the translation.
3. **Competitive Performance**: Results indicate that the LLM achieves BLEU scores comparable to those of leading state-of-the-art systems, and shows promise in zero-shot settings with closed-source models like GPT-4.

**Strengths**

1. **Innovative Approach**: The idea of using a "wait" token to bypass the need for a separate translation policy is intriguing and potentially streamlines the SiMT process.
2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The paper conducts thorough evaluations on multiple datasets, including a newly created test set (NEW-TED-2023), ensuring robustness in performance analysis.
3. **Well-Structured**: The paper is well-organized, with clear sections detailing the methodology, results, and discussions surrounding the implications of the findings.

**Weaknesses**

1. **Lack of Real-World Testing**: While the evaluation of the model on curated datasets is robust, the absence of real-world data testing raises concerns about the practical applicability of the proposed system in live scenarios where contextual information is often richer and more nuanced.
2. **Data Overlap Concerns**: The potential overlap between the fine-tuning dataset and validation/test sets (MuST-C) is mentioned. However, the authors do not adequately address the implications this may have on the validity of the results.
3. **Limited Language Pairs**: The paper currently evaluates only English-German and English-Russian pairs. Future work should explore additional language pairs to validate the generalizability of the proposed approach across diverse linguistic contexts.

**Technical Comments**

1. **Fine-Tuning Strategy**: The use of LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning is commendable; however, a more detailed description of hyperparameter tuning, especially regarding the learning rate and batch size, would enhance the reproducibility of the experiments.
2. **Handling ASR Errors**: The paper acknowledges that the speech-to-text component introduces errors affecting translation quality. A more in-depth discussion of potential techniques to improve ASR accuracy within the proposed framework would be beneficial.
3. **Visualization of Results**: While the performance metrics are well presented, additional visualizations comparing various configurations and the impact of different hyperparameters would strengthen the readers' insight into the system's dynamics.

**Future Directions**

The authors propose several intriguing directions for future work, including the incorporation of background context to enhance translation accuracy and exploring ways to reduce latency further. Additionally, investigating multi-lingual fine-tuning and optimizing the integration of ASR with the LLM would provide valuable insights into overcoming current limitations.

**Conclusion**

Overall, "TRANS LLAMA: LLM-BASED SIMULTANEOUS TRANSLATION SYSTEM" presents a forward-thinking approach to handling simultaneous machine translation using large language models. While the results are promising, the paper would benefit from addressing practical challenges and expanding the scope of evaluation. With further refinement, the proposed model could serve as a notable advancement in the field of machine translation. I recommend acceptance pending some revisions to address the points raised above.
