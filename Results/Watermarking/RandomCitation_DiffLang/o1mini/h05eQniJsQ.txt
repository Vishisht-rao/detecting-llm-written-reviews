**Review of "Understanding Certified Training with Interval Bound Propagation"**

Suivre Boozer et al. (2016), cet article "Understanding Certified Training with Interval Bound Propagation" addresses a significant gap in the theoretical understanding behind the success of certified training methods leveraging Interval Bound Propagation (IBP) for neural networks. As these methods gain popularity in enhancing certifiable robustness against adversarial attacks, the authors provide a much-needed investigation into the mechanisms that contribute to the empirical superiority of IBP-based methods over those that utilize tighter bounds.

**Strengths:**

1. **Theoretical Contributions:** The paper makes notable theoretical advancements by introducing the concept of **propagation tightness** as a metric to measure the tightness of IBP bounds compared to optimal bounds. The derivation of necessary and sufficient conditions for propagation invariance in deep linear networks (DLNs) is a significant contribution that could pave the way for more refined training methodologies.

2. **Empirical Validation:** The authors perform extensive empirical studies confirming their theoretical findings, specifically showcasing the relationship between network architecture (width and depth) and tightness. The results provide a clear demonstration that increasing width enhances both certified accuracy and propagation tightness, while increasing depth negatively impacts tightness, corroborating their theoretical insights.

3. **Insights on Robustness-Accuracy Trade-off:** The work effectively clarifies the trade-offs involved in certified training methods. By elucidating how high tightness is not always necessary for improved robustness, the authors present a nuanced perspective that could have implications for the design of future training algorithms.

4. **Robust Experimental Setup:** The experimental analysis utilizes several benchmark datasets (MNIST and CIFAR-10) with a well-defined methodology, enhancing the reproducibility of results. Their focus on deploying MN-BAB for certification adds credibility to their evaluations.

5. **Clear Structure and Presentation:** The paper is well-structured with a logical flow, making complex concepts accessible. The use of figures (such as the box propagation illustrations) aids in visualizing the theoretical constructs.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Potential Limitations in Generalization:** While the authors concentrate on DLNs and ReLU networks, the results might not generalize seamlessly to other types of architectures or more complex networks. A discussion on the limitations of their findings when applied to different model structures could have strengthened the paper.

2. **Comparative Framework:** The study primarily focuses on IBP methods and their advantages. Comparisons with alternative certified training methods or further exploration of other bounding techniques could provide broader context to their findings. Such comparisons might clarify the unique advantages of IBP beyond those already established.

3. **Empirical Results on Non-IBP Methods:** The paper suggests that non-IBP-based methods yield lower tightness without achieving comparable robustness. However, empirical evaluations of such methods could have served to illustrate the stark differences more explicitly and to quantitatively analyze performance trade-offs.

4. **Specificity of Metric Applicability:** While the propagation tightness metric is a valuable addition to the field, further exploration into its implications for different architectures and datasets would enhance its utility. Consideration of scenarios where tightness might not directly correlate with robustness could also be beneficial.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, this paper represents a commendable addition to the literature on certified training for neural networks. By bridging a significant theoretical gap and providing empirical validation of their findings, the authors contribute valuable insights that can influence future research and application in the field. The work is well-executed, thoroughly discussed, and poised to provide a foundation for developing improved certified training methodologies. I recommend this paper for presentation at ICLR 2024, with minor revisions to enhance discussion on the generalizability of their findings.
