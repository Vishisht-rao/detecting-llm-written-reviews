OUTPUT:
Suivre Hammett et al. (2023), cet article presents a significant and timely contribution to the field of materials science, particularly in predicting the properties of crystalline solids using textual descriptions. The relevance of this research is underscored by the ongoing challenge of efficiently predicting crystal properties, which is pivotal for advancing material design and discovery.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach**: This paper applies large language models (LLMs) to tackle a problem traditionally dominated by graph neural networks (GNNs). The exploration of text-based methodologies is commendable, as it recognizes the potential of rich textual data in conveying nuanced information not easily captured by graphs. The authors argue convincingly for the advantages of using text representations, particularly for capturing critical structural information, such as space group symmetry and Wyckoff sites.

2. **Dataset Development**: The authors introduce a benchmark dataset, TextEdge, with 144K crystal text descriptions and corresponding properties, which is an excellent resource for the community. The release of such a dataset is crucial, addressing a primary limitation that has hindered similar research in the past.

3. **Strong Empirical Results**: The proposed model, LLM-Prop, demonstrates superior performance against state-of-the-art GNN models, achieving notable improvements in predicting band gap, volume, and classification of band gap types. The rigorous comparison with established baselines not only highlights the effectiveness of LLM-Prop but also provides clarity on its competitive edge.

4. **Clear Methodological Framework**: The detailed description of the architecture, particularly the choice to utilize the T5 encoder while discarding the decoder for regression tasks, presents a well-reasoned decision backed by empirical results. This approach minimizes computational demands while facilitating the integration of longer text sequences, which is likely a significant factor in LLM-Prop's success.

5. **Reproducibility and Fair Comparison**: The authors ensure a fair evaluation by using the same data splits for all models, which is critical for replicating the results and validating the findings presented in the paper.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Exploration of Limitations**: While the paper highlights the advantages of LLM-Prop, it could benefit from a more thorough examination of the limitations encountered during the study. For instance, the reasons behind the performance gaps related to the encoding of numerical data (bond distances and angles) could be analyzed further, potentially guiding future improvements.

2. **Scope of Predictions**: Although the study focused on physical and electronic properties, expanding the discussion to include other properties like thermal or mechanical properties could broaden the impact and applicability of the proposed method. This could position LLM-Prop as a versatile tool for various materials science applications.

3. **User Accessibility**: For broader usage of the TextEdge dataset and LLM-Prop, additional details on how to implement the model or apply it to new datasets would enhance usability and encourage community engagement. Providing example code or a user-friendly interface could facilitate adoption by researchers less familiar with machine learning.

**Conclusion**: 

Overall, the paper makes a compelling case for leveraging LLMs in the context of crystal property prediction, alongside a well-defined methodology and impressive experimental results. While there are areas for improvement, particularly concerning the exploration of limitations and the model's accessibility, the contributions outlined are substantial and will likely stimulate further research in the intersection of natural language processing and materials science. I recommend this work for acceptance at ICLR 2024, as it provides valuable insights and foundational resources for advancing predictive analytics in materials science.
