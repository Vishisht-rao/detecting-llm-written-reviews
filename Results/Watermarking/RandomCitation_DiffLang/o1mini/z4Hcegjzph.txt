**Review of "Pre-training with Random Orthogonal Projection Image Modeling"**

This paper introduces a novel approach for self-supervised visual pre-training, termed Random Orthogonal Projection Image Modeling (ROPIM). The proposed method aims to enhance the existing Masked Image Modeling (MIM) techniques by applying random orthogonal projections to patches of input images instead of the conventional binary masking techniques. The authors argue that this new approach can lead to superior performance in terms of both accuracy and training efficiency on multiple standard benchmarks.

### Strengths:

1. **Innovative Approach**: The concept of using random orthogonal projections in place of standard masking is intriguing. It presents a fresh perspective within the domain of self-supervised learning, which has seen increasing demand for efficient pre-training strategies.

2. **Empirical Validation**: The authors provide extensive experiments demonstrating the efficacy of ROPIM compared to several state-of-the-art methods. The results exhibit not just improved accuracy but also reduced training time, which is a critical factor in real-world applications.

3. **Clear Comparisons**: The paper includes several comparative analyses with existing methods, particularly highlighting the efficiency of ROPIM against notable benchmarks like MAE, BEiT, and MoCo v3. The clarity in presenting results (e.g., Figures and Tables) makes it easy for readers to grasp the performance metrics.

4. **Theoretical Foundation**: ROPIM is well-grounded in theoretical principles of count sketching and orthogonal projection. The paper articulates the properties and advantages of these mathematical frameworks, which could inspire further research.

5. **No Dependency on Complex Architectures**: The authors stress that ROPIM does not rely on additional, complex architectures or tokenization processes that some current approaches necessitate. This simplicity could make ROPIM an appealing choice in practice.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Limited Discussion on Limitations**: While the study showcases strong performance across several datasets, the weaknesses and potential limitations of ROPIM have not been adequately discussed. For instance, how might this method perform in scenarios with high variability in image quality or resolution?

2. **Comparison with Non-Transformer-Based Methods**: The focus is predominantly on transformer-based backbones without considering how ROPIM might generalize to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or other architectures. Including these comparisons could enhance the applicability scope of ROPIM.

3. **Diversity of Datasets**: The evaluation mainly revolves around popular benchmarks like ImageNet and CIFAR. Introducing additional, varied datasets could provide insights into the robustness and generalization of the ROPIM approach, especially in more complex real-world scenarios.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**: While accuracy metrics are crucial, additional evaluation metrics such as computational costs or memory requirements during inference could present a more holistic view of the method's efficiency.

### Recommendations for Improvement:

- Expand the discussion on the limitations of the proposed method and provide a balanced view of its applicability across different types of datasets and architectures.
- Include a wider variety of datasets in the experiments section to better demonstrate the generalizability of the ROPIM framework.
- Consider analyzing ROPIM compared to non-transformer-based methodologies to enrich the comparisons and enhance the paper's relevance to broader audiences.

### Conclusion:

In conclusion, "Pre-training with Random Orthogonal Projection Image Modeling" offers a significant contribution to the field of self-supervised learning by introducing an innovative approach that demonstrates promising results. By addressing the outlined weaknesses and expanding the exploration of ROPIM's applicability, the authors could further strengthen their work. Overall, this paper is a commendable addition to the literature and should stimulate further investigation into efficient self-supervised pre-training techniques. 

**Rating: 8/10**
