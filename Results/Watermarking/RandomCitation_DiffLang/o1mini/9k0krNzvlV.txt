OUTPUT:
**Review of "On the Learnability of Watermarks for Language Models"**

**Summary:**
The paper investigates the capacity of language models to learn watermarks for generated text, presenting potentially significant implications for the robustness and deployment of watermarking strategies in open language models. The authors identify a gap in the existing literature regarding the learnability of watermarksâ€”where previous methods typically relied on specialized decoding algorithms rather than allowing models to learn watermarks directly through their parameters. To address this, the authors propose a novel approach termed "watermark distillation," training a student model to replicate the output of a teacher model employing traditional decoding-based watermarking. The study evaluates multiple watermarking strategies and assesses their detectability and trade-offs with generation quality.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Contribution**: The introduction of watermark distillation is a noteworthy contribution to the field, representing a shift towards utilizing standard decoding methods for watermarking rather than relying solely on complex, tailored algorithms. This opens the door for more flexible watermarking applications, particularly in open models.

2. **Comprehensive Experimental Design**: The authors conducted a thorough investigation, assessing various watermarking strategies (KGW, Aar, and KTH) and hyperparameter settings. This breadth provides a solid foundation for evaluating the implications of different watermarking approaches.

3. **Clear Results**: The experimental findings are well-presented, highlighting the ability of models to learn high-detectability watermarks while documenting the challenges associated with lower-distortion watermarks. The use of statistical methods to quantify detectability (e.g., p-values) adds rigor to the evaluation.

4. **Addressing Adversarial Risks**: The evaluation of spoofing attacks is a critical addition. The implications of potential adversarial behavior against watermarking systems are important and relevant to real-world applications, advocating for further scrutiny in how watermarking is implemented.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Discussion on Practical Implications**: Although the findings are significant, the paper could benefit from a deeper discussion on the practical implications of the learnability of watermarks. How might these findings influence the deployment of LMs in sensitive applications, and what are the policy implications of adversarial spoofing?

2. **Fine-tuning Robustness**: The authors identify a significant limitation concerning the vulnerability of learned watermarks to fine-tuning on normal text. Future explorations should address strategies to enhance robustness during the fine-tuning phase, which is a known practice in model development.

3. **Potential Overreliance on Statistical Measures**: While the focus on statistical p-values for detectability is valid, it may be beneficial to incorporate additional qualitative assessments of the generated text, especially regarding user perception of watermarked vs. non-watermarked outputs.

4. **Scope of Evaluation Datasets**: The generalizability of results across datasets is an important feature to consider. While the study evaluates models on specific datasets, it would strengthen the claims to include a wider range of human-generated texts across various domains, enhancing the robustness of the conclusions drawn.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper presents an impactful exploration into the learnability of watermarks in language models, introducing innovative methodologies and revealing implications for both development and deployment in practice. While the work is robust and provides a clear path for future research in watermarking techniques, it would benefit from additional consideration of practical applications and addressing the challenges highlighted in model fine-tuning. This work is likely to stimulate further research and discussion on watermarking in the burgeoning field of language generation. I recommend acceptance for publication with minor revisions to enhance the discussion around practical implications and robustness to fine-tuning. 

**Rating: 8/10**
