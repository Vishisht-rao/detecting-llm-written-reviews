**Review of "Global Convergence Rate of Deep Equilibrium Models with General Activations"**

Following Ledesma et al. (2015), this article presents a significant advancement in the theoretical analysis of Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) by demonstrating that the gradient descent converges to a globally optimal solution at a linear convergence rate for DEQs with general activation functions that have bounded first and second derivatives. The authors extend the work of Ling et al. (2022) and provide a robust framework to address convergence properties for non-linear activations, which is essential given the growing diversity of activation functions employed in deep learning.

**Strengths:**

1. **Theoretical Contributions:** The paper provides substantial theoretical insights into the convergence properties of DEQs, showing that similar results from ReLU-based DEQs can be extended to more general activation functions. This is particularly valuable for the community, as it enhances our understanding of how various activations affect training dynamics and convergence.

2. **Innovative Methodologies:** The introduction of a novel population Gram matrix and the dual activation method based on Hermite polynomial expansions is a commendable innovation. This methodology presents a novel way to overcome the complexities introduced by general activation functions, thereby broadening the applicability of DEQ theories.

3. **Empirical Validation:** The authors support their theoretical findings with numerical experiments on standard datasets (MNIST and CIFAR-10), demonstrating that their proposed approach works effectively in practice. The clear connection between theory and practice strengthens the paper's contributions.

4. **Comprehensive Literature Review:** The authors present a thorough review of existing literature on DEQs and convergence rates, contextualizing their work well within the current research landscape. This helps to highlight the novelty and importance of their contributions.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Clarity and Organization:** While the paper is rich in content, some sections may benefit from increased clarity. For example, certain theorems and proofs are quite dense and may be difficult for readers not deeply familiar with the specifics of DEQ theory to follow. Simplifying explanations and possibly including more intuitive descriptions would enhance accessibility.

2. **Broader Experimental Evaluation:** Although experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 are valuable, the evaluation could be strengthened by testing on a broader range of datasets and tasks to validate the robustness of the proposed methods across varying domains. Additionally, comparative analyses with other state-of-the-art methods could provide deeper insights into the advantages of the proposed approach.

3. **Discussion on Limitations:** While the paper presents compelling results, a more detailed discussion of the potential limitations and assumptions underlying the findings would increase transparency. For instance, a clearer exposition on the implications of the boundedness requirements of the activations and how they might restrict the applicability of the results could be beneficial.

4. **Future Research Directions:** The paper briefly mentions future research directions concerning the linear convergence rate for other activation functions. Expanding on this discussion could provide further context for potential lines of inquiry and the broader impact of this work.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a well-reasoned and significant advancement in the study of DEQs, showcasing the potential for achieving a global convergence rate with general activations. The methods are novel and potentially impactful, opening avenues for further exploration in the training dynamics of deep learning models. With refinements in clarity, experimental breadth, and discussion of limitations, the paper has the potential to make a lasting contribution to the field of deep learning theory. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions for clarity and broader experimentation.
