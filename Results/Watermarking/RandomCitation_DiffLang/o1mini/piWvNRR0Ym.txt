OUTPUT:
**Review of Towards Minimal Targeted Updates of Language Models with Targeted Negative Training**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel method termed Targeted Negative Training (TNT) aimed at refining language models by minimizing undesirable outputs while preserving their performance on benign generations. The authors define the concept of a "minimal targeted update" and critique existing methods that do not effectively control the redistribution of probability mass during model training when negative examples are introduced. The authors validate their approach through experiments focused on reducing hallucinations in summarization tasks and avoiding toxicity in response generation. They report that TNT outperforms baseline methods in managing the trade-off between suppressing undesirable behaviour and maintaining similarity to the original model's outputs.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty**: The idea of using negative examples for fine-tuning language models by focusing on maintaining proximity to the original model's distributions is innovative and addresses a critical gap in existing methodologies. 

2. **Well-Defined Problem**: The authors clearly articulate the issues with existing approaches (like coarse data filtering and typical negative signal losses) and propose a comprehensive framework for understanding and correcting unwanted model behaviour.

3. **Experimental Validation**: The experiments conducted on realistic tasks (hallucination in summarization and toxicity in online comments) convincingly support the utility of TNT. The inclusion of concrete metrics (like BLEU, ROUGE, and disfluency measures) adds robustness to the findings.

4. **Iterative Architecture**: The paper highlights the commutative property of negative updates, which allows for flexibility in adapting the model's capabilities iteratively. This is particularly relevant for applications needing continuous refinement to adhere to changing standards or societal norms.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity of Implementation**: While the theoretical foundation of TNT is sound, the necessity for detailed token-level annotations could be a barrier to widespread adoption. The authors acknowledge this challenge, yet further exploration of how to efficiently gather these annotations would enhance the paper.

2. **Experimental Limitations**: The evaluation metrics, while standard, might not fully capture the qualitative aspects of generated outputs. It would be beneficial to incorporate human evaluations or case studies to provide deeper insights into how TNT affects the coherence and relevance of the outputs.

3. **Generalizability**: The paper primarily focuses on two tasks. More extensive evaluations across a broader spectrum of downstream applications would bolster claims regarding the versatility of the TNT approach. 

4. **Ethics and Safety Considerations**: Although the paper addresses the reduction of unwanted outputs, a more detailed discussion on ethical implications and potential biases introduced by annotated datasets is needed. This is particularly relevant in the context of model safety concerning sensitive topics.

5. **Clarity**: There are sections with dense mathematical descriptions that could benefit from further clarification. Simplifying or breaking down complex equations into more intuitive explanations would make the work accessible to a broader audience, especially those less familiar with the theoretical underpinnings.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper makes a notable contribution to the field of controlled language generation by proposing TNT, which effectively addresses the challenges of minimizing negative outputs while preserving model behavior. With further refinements and clarifications, particularly around practical implementation and ethical considerations, this work could significantly impact future language model training and deployment strategies. I recommend acceptance of the paper with the suggestion to address the noted weaknesses in the final version.
