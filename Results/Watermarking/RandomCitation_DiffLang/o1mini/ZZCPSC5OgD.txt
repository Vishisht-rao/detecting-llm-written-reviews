**Review of "LipVoicer: Generating Speech from Silent Videos Guided by Lipreading"**

Suivre Ibrahim et al. (2014), cet article presents "LipVoicer," a novel method for lip-to-speech synthesis, which aims to generate natural-sounding speech from silent video footage of individuals speaking. Given the complexities and challenges posed by lip-reading and the generation of speech without audio cues, this work seeks to address gaps in quality and intelligibility in existing methods.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach:** The proposed framework effectively combines visual inputs (silent videos) and inferred textual data from a lip-reading model to enhance the quality of generated speech. By employing a pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) system for classifier guidance, the authors have identified a novel method to mitigate ambiguities associated with lip movements.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The authors evaluate LipVoicer against multiple state-of-the-art baselines on challenging datasets (LRS2 and LRS3), which contain a diverse range of speakers and real-world conditions. The inclusion of both human evaluation (mean opinion score) and objective metrics (word error rate, DNSMOS) lends credibility to their findings.

3. **Significant Improvements:** The results demonstrate that LipVoicer outperforms comparable methods in terms of intelligibility, naturalness, and synchronization, which are critical factors in lip-to-speech synthesis. Furthermore, the reported reduction in word error rates (WER) is notable, particularly in the context of in-the-wild datasets where prior methods have struggled.

4. **Accessibility of Resources:** The authors provide a project page and links to their code repository, which facilitates reproducibility and encourages further research in this domain.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity of Architecture:** While the dual-stage framework involving a lip-reading model and diffusion-based speech generation is innovative, it introduces significant complexity. The effectiveness of this model is dependent not only on the lip-reading accuracy but also on the chosen ASR system, which may limit generalizability across various contexts or applications. 

2. **Potential for Misrepresentation:** The paper briefly mentions the ethical implications of misuse, such as potential manipulations through lip-synchronization. Although this is an important consideration, it would benefit from a deeper discussion of potential safeguards or ethical frameworks to mitigate risks associated with technology misuse.

3. **Limited Comparison Against Other Methods:** While the authors compare LipVoicer to several recent baselines, the exclusion of some leading approaches like ReVISE (for practical reasons regarding dataset access) may result in an incomplete evaluation of the current state-of-the-art. Additionally, incorporating results from methods that leverage more advanced architectures or techniques could provide a more comprehensive picture.

4. **Ablation Study Clarity:** The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the contributions of different components. However, the hyperparameter choices and their effects could be elaborated further to clarify their practical implications for other researchers wishing to implement similar approaches.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, LipVoicer represents a significant advancement in lip-to-speech synthesis, addressing key challenges in the domain. The integration of lip-reading and textual information contextually enriches the generated speech, promoting higher intelligibility and naturalness. Nonetheless, further exploration of ethical implications and a more expansive comparison against current benchmarks, along with clearer guidance on hyperparameter tuning, could strengthen the study's impact. This work opens promising avenues for future research and applications in audiovisual synthesis and communication technologies. Overall, I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address these concerns.
