**Review of "Understanding and Controlling a Maze-Solving Policy Network"**

Following Petro et al. (2018), this paper presents a systematic exploration of the internal goals and goal representations within a pretrained reinforcement learning policy network designed for solving mazes. The authors dive into the intricacies of how these networks may misgeneralize their goals, particularly through a detailed analysis of contextual influences on policy behavior and the mechanisms underlying goal-directed actions.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty of Approach**: The study uniquely focuses on understanding the internal objectives of reinforcement learning policies, which is an under-explored area compared to the broader interpretability literature. The identification of context-dependent goals and corresponding circuits within the network is a significant contribution.

2. **Robust Experiments**: The authors conduct extensive experiments across 5,000 distinct maze environments, using solid statistical methods (e.g., ℓ1-regularized logistic regression) to predict the policy’s behavior and highlight the context dependency of its goals. This thoroughness lends credibility to their findings.

3. **Activation Engineering**: The paper introduces innovative techniques such as manual modification of activations and the combination of activations from different forward passes to steer policy output without retraining. This allows for a practical dialogue on the implications of understanding and controlling AI behaviors, which is pivotal for safe AI deployment.

4. **Insightful Visualizations**: The use of insightful figures and heatmaps effectively illustrates how activations can track goal locations and how interventions affect policy behavior, presenting a clear visual narrative to the technical findings.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Lack of Generalizability**: While the maze environment provides a controlled context for the experiments, the study does not explore the implications of these findings in more complex or varied environments. The authors could discuss how their insights might translate to more complex reinforcement learning tasks or real-world applications.

2. **Limited Theoretical Foundation**: The theoretical background on why certain circuits in the network lead to specific behaviors could be expanded. While the empirical results are strong, a deeper theoretical explanation would enhance understanding of the phenomena observed.

3. **Control Limitations**: The paper notes that the interventions can only partially retarget the policy, and there are instances where the policy ignores modifications. A discussion of the limitations in control capabilities, potential failures, or undesired outcomes could inform both researchers and practitioners in applying these interventions.

4. **Interpretability Discussion**: While there is a mention of interpretability, a more thorough investigation of how these findings might contribute to the broader discourse on AI alignment and safety would be beneficial. The paper discusses goal misgeneralization but could connect its findings to potential safety measures in deploying AI systems in real-world scenarios.

**Overall Impression:**

This paper makes important contributions towards understanding and controlling the behaviors of reinforcement learning policy networks. It elucidates the nuanced and context-dependent nature of goal representations, highlighting how specific activation modifications can affect network output. Despite some limitations, including a need for more generalizability and a deeper theoretical framework, the paper is a valuable addition to the field of AI interpretability and control, deserving consideration for publication at ICLR 2024. 

**Recommendation:** Accept with minor revisions.
