**Review of "Towards Optimal Regret in Adversarial Linear MDPs with Bandit Feedback"**

Following Bolduc et al. (2014), this paper presents significant advancements in the field of online reinforcement learning within the context of linear Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) that are adversarial and operate under bandit feedback without prior knowledge of transition dynamics or access to simulators. The authors propose two novel algorithms, achieving improved regret bounds for the defined problem setting. 

### Summary and Contributions

The paper successfully addresses a crucial gap in existing literature by providing the first algorithm that demonstrates a regret bound of \( \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{K}) \) through a computationally inefficient method and a second method that guarantees a regret of \( \mathcal{O}(K^{3/4}) \) with reasonable computational efficiency. These results significantly surpass the previous state-of-the-art algorithms, which achieved \( \mathcal{O}(K^{4/5} + \text{poly}(1/\lambda_{\text{min}})) \) and \( \mathcal{O}(K^{6/7}) \) regret bounds.

The authors employ state space discretization and model-free estimation techniques to accurately estimate occupancy measures without a simulator. Additionally, the paper provides insightful connections to the policy optimization framework, introducing the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) algorithm integrated with a log-determinant barrier regularizer, which enhances the algorithm's stability.

### Strengths

1. **Novel Methodology**: The introduction of a computationally inefficient \( \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{K}) \) algorithm is a groundbreaking step toward optimal regret bounds for adversarial linear MDPs.
  
2. **Structured Comparisons with Existing Works**: The authors effectively contextualize their contributions against a well-established backdrop of existing literature, clearly articulating advancements over recent works by Kong et al. (2023) and Sherman et al. (2023b).

3. **Robust Mathematical Foundations**: The detailed mathematical derivations and analysis throughout the paper support the claims made regarding the algorithms' performance, including proper treatment of challenges posed by the absence of exploratory policies.

4. **Clear Proposals for Future Work**: The authors conclude with thoughts on potential techniques and directions that might yield statistically optimal yet computationally efficient algorithms in future research, which is constructive for the field.

### Weaknesses

1. **Utility of Inefficient Algorithm**: The proposed algorithm with a \( \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{K}) \) regret, while theoretically interesting, lacks practical applicability unless computational efficiency can be addressed. The paper could benefit from discussing scenarios where this algorithm might be advantageous despite its inefficiency.

2. **Assumptions and Limitations**: The reliance on specific assumptions (e.g., discretizing state and policy spaces) must be clearly justified concerning real-world applications and whether they can be universally applied.

3. **Technical Complexity**: While mathematical rigor is commendable, the complexity in certain sections (particularly the proofs and algorithm design) might hinder accessibility for practitioners aiming to implement the algorithms in real-world scenarios.

4. **Comparative Empirical Results**: The paper heavily focuses on theoretical contributions and lacks empirical validation of the proposed algorithms. Including experiments demonstrating the algorithms' performance compared to existing baselines would significantly strengthen the paper.

### Conclusion

Overall, this paper represents a noteworthy contribution to the advancement of online reinforcement learning under adversarial settings, achieving significant theoretical results regarding regret bounds. The combination of new algorithms and robust mathematical foundations offers a solid foundation for future research. However, addressing computational efficiency and providing empirical validations could enhance the paper's practical implications. Hence, I recommend this paper for acceptance, with the expectation that the authors consider iterative improvements related to identified weaknesses.
