OUTPUT:
Following Sherry et al. (2022), this paper presents WizardCoder, a novel approach to enhance Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) using a code-specific adaptation of the Evol-Instruct method, named Code Evol-Instruct. The authors fine-tune StarCoder and CodeLlama with data generated through Code Evol-Instruct, demonstrating significant performance improvements across several code generation benchmarks (HumanEval, HumanEval+, MBPP, DS-1000, and MultiPL-E). The key contributions highlighted are the Code Evol-Instruct methodology, the resulting WizardCoder models outperforming existing open-source Code LLMs, and a preliminary study emphasizing the importance of instruction complexity in coding performance.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The Code Evol-Instruct approach is a well-motivated adaptation of Evol-Instruct for the code domain. The introduction of heuristics aligned with coding tasks, adversarial samples (erroneous code), and time/space complexity requirements are innovative ways to increase instruction complexity.
*   **Empirical Results:** The paper presents compelling experimental results. WizardCoder consistently outperforms other open-source Code LLMs on a diverse set of benchmarks. The fact that WizardCoder 15B surpasses Claude and Bard on HumanEval/HumanEval+ is particularly impressive.  The performance on HumanEval+ compared to GPT3.5 also strengthens the claim.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The inclusion of five different benchmarks (HumanEval, HumanEval+, MBPP, DS-1000, MultiPL-E) across multiple programming languages provides a robust evaluation of the proposed method.
*   **Analysis of Instruction Complexity:** The initial study investigating the impact of instruction complexity is valuable. Analyzing whether performance gains come from increased samples or tokens is essential to validate the effectiveness of Code Evol-Instruct.  The exploration of similarity between training and test data is a nice addition.
*   **Well-Written:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the methodology and results. The inclusion of figures and tables helps to present the information clearly.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Ablation Studies:** While the analysis explores complexity and similarity, a more detailed ablation study of the individual components of Code Evol-Instruct (e.g., removing the adversarial sample heuristic) would further strengthen the claims.  Understanding the specific contribution of each heuristic is important.
*   **Scalability of Evol-Instruct:** The reliance on GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 for instruction evolution may be a limitation. A more cost-effective and scalable approach for the evolution process would be desirable.  Using CodeLlama-Instruct is a good step, but further work here is beneficial.
*   **Details on Dev Set:** The description of the "external dev set" for controlling the evolution stop is brief. More details on its composition and the criteria used for stopping the evolution would be helpful.
*   **DS-1000 Evaluation:** The discussion of challenges in aligning the 34B model with the DS-1000 framework weakens the presentation of results on this benchmark.
*   **Data Filtering:** The GPT-4 data filtering approach is good; however, more details around the percentage of data removed would be beneficial.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Ablation Study:** Conduct an ablation study to assess the individual impact of the different heuristics used in Code Evol-Instruct.
*   **Scalability of Evolution:** Explore more scalable alternatives to GPT-3.5/GPT-4 for instruction evolution.
*   **Dev Set Details:** Provide more information about the composition and usage of the external dev set.
*   **DS-1000 Discussion:** Clarify the challenges encountered with the DS-1000 benchmark or focus more on the other benchmarks where the results are more consistent.
*   **Data Filtering details:** include details regarding what percentage of data was removed during filtering.
*   **Error analysis:** Provide some qualitative error analysis of the generated code, highlighting the types of errors the model still makes and the potential directions for further improvement.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that introduces a valuable technique for improving Code LLMs. The Code Evol-Instruct approach is novel and effective, and the WizardCoder models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance among open-source alternatives. Addressing the suggestions above would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact.
