OUTPUT:
Following Wofford et al. (2017), this paper addresses the challenging problem of action-background confusion in weakly-supervised temporal action localization (WS-TAL), specifically focusing on the point-supervised setting. The paper proposes a new framework, FS-PTAL, that aims to achieve fine-grained separation of action and background by extending point-level labels and utilizing score contrast and feature separation modules. The core idea is to generate dense pseudo labels from sparse point annotations, thereby providing more precise position information to the model. The paper claims significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Relevance:** The action-background confusion is a well-known and critical issue in WS-TAL. The paper clearly identifies the limitations of existing point-supervised methods in effectively addressing this problem.
*   **Novel Approach:** The proposed FS-PTAL framework introduces a novel combination of techniques, including label extension, pseudo label mining, score contrast, and feature separation. The integration of these modules appears well-motivated and designed to address specific aspects of the action-background confusion.
*   **Clear Explanation:** The paper provides a generally clear and detailed explanation of the proposed framework, including the individual modules and their functionalities. The figures (especially Figure 2) are helpful in understanding the overall architecture.
*   **Comprehensive Experiments:** The experimental evaluation is extensive, with results reported on four benchmark datasets. The ablation studies provide insights into the contribution of each module to the overall performance. The comparison with state-of-the-art methods demonstrates the superiority of the proposed FS-PTAL framework.
*   **Improved Performance:** The paper shows significant performance gains, particularly on THUMOS14, which indicates the effectiveness of the proposed framework in separating action and background. The gains at higher IoU thresholds are especially encouraging.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity in Label Extension:** While the general idea of label extension is understandable, the specific details of the "sampling weight vector" and the cumulative distribution function approach in Section 3.1 could be clarified further. The rationale behind choosing specific values for τ1 and τ2 should be better justified and explained. While the appendix mentions this, it could be better integrated into the main text.
*   **Pseudo Label Mining Details:** The description of the pseudo label mining strategy, especially Algorithm 2 in the appendix, could benefit from more intuitive explanation. The rationale behind the chosen thresholds γbkg and γact should be discussed in greater detail. A more visual example of how the pseudo labels are generated (similar to Figure 4 but perhaps with the score plots displayed) would be helpful.
*   **Justification of Hyperparameter Choices:** Although the paper mentions a grid search, a more comprehensive discussion on the sensitivity of the model to the hyperparameters λ1, λ2, λ3, and λ4 would strengthen the paper. While Table 3 shows the sensitivity to other hyperparameters, the loss weights are not addressed.
*   **Limited Qualitative Analysis:** While qualitative results are presented, a deeper analysis of failure cases and potential limitations of the FS-PTAL framework would be valuable. Understanding scenarios where the method still struggles to separate action and background would further improve the understanding of its strengths and weaknesses.
*   **Minor Presentation Issues:** There are a few minor grammatical and typographical errors throughout the paper (e.g., missing spaces, incorrect capitalization, inconsistencies in notation). A careful proofreading pass is recommended. The appendix has particularly dense text that could be broken up to be more readable.

**Questions for the authors:**

*   Can you provide more intuition behind the label extension module and the specific choice of sampling weights?
*   What is the computational overhead of the feature separation module, and how does it affect the overall training time?
*   How does the performance of FS-PTAL vary across different action categories? Are there specific categories where the method performs particularly well or poorly?
*   What are the limitations of the current framework, and what future research directions do you envision?

**Overall Recommendation:**

This paper presents a well-motivated and effective approach to address the action-background confusion problem in point-supervised temporal action localization. The proposed FS-PTAL framework achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods. While there are some areas that could be further clarified and improved, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field and is worthy of acceptance, pending minor revisions to address the comments outlined above. I recommend a weak accept.
