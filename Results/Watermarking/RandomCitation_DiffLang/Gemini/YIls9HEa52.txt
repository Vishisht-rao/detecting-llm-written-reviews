OUTPUT:
Following McGinty et al. (2020), this paper introduces the infinite recurrent switching linear dynamical system (irSLDS), a novel extension of the recurrent switching linear dynamical system (rSLDS) aimed at addressing limitations related to a fixed number of states and a lack of latent structure in state organization. The core contribution lies in endowing the rSLDS model with a semi-Markov discrete state process that incorporates latent geometry, leveraging partial differential equations (PDEs) to derive an efficient, semi-parametric formulation for dynamical sufficient statistics. The authors validate their model on synthetic data and demonstrate its capabilities in uncovering non-stationary processes in mice electrophysiological data during decision-making.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The irSLDS model addresses critical limitations of the rSLDS model, offering a more flexible and interpretable framework for analyzing complex neural dynamics. The introduction of a PDE-based prior over discrete state transitions is a novel approach.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The paper provides a detailed description of the model, including its generative formalism and inference procedure. The derivation of the PDE-based prior and its connection to the distance dependent Chinese Restaurant Process (dist-CRP) is well-motivated. The use of variational Laplace-EM for inference and the discussion of parallelization using scans demonstrate a strong understanding of computational challenges and solutions.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The model is rigorously validated on both synthetic and real-world data. The synthetic NASCAR task provides a controlled environment for evaluating the model's performance and highlighting its advantages over existing methods. The application to mice electrophysiological data demonstrates the model's ability to uncover meaningful insights into neural activity during decision-making.
*   **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the model's components and experimental results. The figures are informative and effectively illustrate the key concepts.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors build upon existing codebases (SSM package) and provide implementation details, enhancing the potential for reproducibility.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Scan operation limitation:** The authors acknowledge that their scan operation implementation for parallel computing doesn't fully support automatic differentiation, which may affect performance. Expanding on the nature and possible mitigation strategies would enhance the paper.
*   **Limited Ephys results:** The authors acknowledge limitations in the scope of ephys data, with only one session presented in full detail. Expanding to a larger dataset and brain areas will be important for future work.
*   **Hyperparameter sensitivity:** While the authors explore the impact of hyperparameters, a more in-depth analysis of the sensitivity of the model to these parameters, especially γ and κ, would be beneficial. The paper mentions that their influence is more evident for a high K. Clarifying what "high" entails, and possibly providing practical guidance for hyperparameter selection, would strengthen the paper's utility.
*   **Alternative smoothness priors:** The authors claim many alternate priors could offer a form of spatial smoothness with similar temporal dynamics. While they state why they picked the heat equation, a more explicit comparison of the pros and cons of some other priors (e.g., Gaussian process) could strengthen this justification.
*   **Missing Refrence:** "McGinty et al. (2020)" needs to be provided in the references.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   Provide a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the scan operation and potential solutions. What is the current practical impact of the scan limitation in terms of training time increase, convergence, and performance on other models?
*   Expand the experimental validation to include a larger and more diverse dataset of electrophysiological recordings.
*   Conduct a more thorough analysis of the sensitivity of the model to hyperparameters and provide practical guidance for their selection. Also, what are good intialization values for parameters such as the values used for β (line 26, Listing 2).
*   Elaborate on alternative smoothness priors and justify the choice of the heat equation in more detail. What would be the most straight forward other option, and why is the current approach prefered?
*   Include and link the paper that is referenced at the start of the review "McGinty et al. (2020)".

**Overall:**

The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of neural dynamics modeling. The irSLDS model offers a promising approach for addressing the limitations of existing methods and uncovering meaningful insights into complex neural activity. The model is rigorously validated on both synthetic and real-world data, and the paper is generally well-written and organized. Addressing the minor weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper. I would recommend acceptance, pending minor revisions.
