OUTPUT:
Following Lott et al. (2020), this paper introduces "shuffle coding," a novel method for lossless compression of unordered data structures, leveraging bits-back coding to achieve optimal compression rates. The core idea revolves around constructing codecs for unordered objects from codecs for ordered objects, effectively eliminating redundancy arising from arbitrary ordering. The paper grounds its approach in the theoretical framework of "combinatorial species," providing a formal foundation for handling various data structures like multisets, graphs, and hypergraphs.

**Strengths:**

*   **Generality and Applicability:** A major strength is the method's generality. It's not a one-off solution for a specific data structure but a framework applicable to a wide range of unordered data. The provided examples (multisets, graphs) and the promise of extension to others (hypergraphs, JSON-like structures) showcase its broad potential. The release of source code further enhances its accessibility and practical applicability.
*   **Theoretical Soundness:** The paper provides a clear and theoretically sound derivation of the optimal rate for compression, accounting for the automorphism group of the object being compressed. The use of concepts from group theory is appropriate and well-integrated. Lemma 3.2 and the subsequent derivation of equation (14) are central to the paper's contribution.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The experimental results on graph datasets, including molecular data from TUDatasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of shuffle coding in achieving state-of-the-art compression rates. The comparison with existing methods like PnC and SZIP is valuable. The ablation studies are also helpful in understanding the impact of various design choices.
*   **Clarity of Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and logically structured. The background section provides the necessary context, and the method is explained in a step-by-step manner with illustrative examples. The inclusion of pseudocode for the `encode` and `decode` functions aids in understanding the implementation.
*   **Bits-back coding integration:** The usage of "Bits-back with ANS" coding makes this paper unique.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Computational Complexity:** The reliance on computing canonical orderings and automorphism groups, particularly for graphs, poses a significant computational bottleneck. The paper acknowledges this limitation, stating that no polynomial-time algorithm is known for graphs in general. The suggestion of approximation introduces a trade-off, but a more detailed discussion of practical approximation strategies and their impact on compression rate would be beneficial. A further note: while the authors mentioned that only 10 percent of the time is spent on canonization, that is likely dataset-dependent. This will need to be clarified.
*   **Initial Bits Issue:** The "initial bits" problem, where the rate discount is not realized for the first few objects compressed, is a genuine limitation. While the paper acknowledges this and mentions a possible solution (interleaving encoding and decoding), a more in-depth analysis of the impact of this issue on smaller datasets would be valuable. It is unclear if the amortization will work for smaller datasets.
*   **Model Dependence:** The compression performance is heavily reliant on the underlying statistical model used for ordered objects. While the paper demonstrates improvements using a PÃ³lya urn model, a more thorough exploration of different model choices and their impact on compression rate would strengthen the findings. There should also be further discussion on how to pick the correct statistical model for the graph.
*   **Lack of Speed Optimization:** The paper says that it uses Nauty for computing canonical orderings and automorphism groups. The authors should provide details on how the code utilizes the Nauty library.
*   **Definition Ambiguity:** The difference between *ordered* and *unordered* graphs can be ambiguous without context. The authors should provide examples to clarify this ambiguity.
*   **Related Work:** The 'structural ZIP' (SZIP) results don't have enough details. The authors mention that SZIP can achieve good rates on a single graph, while shuffle coding is good for sequences of objects. However, the reader does not have enough data to compare whether single-graph-SZIP is better than sequence-based-shuffle coding. This part should be elaborated more.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Computational Complexity:** Expand the discussion of approximation strategies for canonical ordering and automorphism group computation. Provide concrete examples and analyze the trade-off between speed and compression rate.
*   **Initial Bits:** Quantify the impact of the "initial bits" issue on smaller datasets and provide more details on the proposed solution (interleaving encoding and decoding).
*   **Model Exploration:** Conduct a more systematic exploration of different statistical models for ordered objects and analyze their impact on compression rate. Provide guidelines for selecting appropriate models for different types of data.
*   **Speed Optimization:** Provide further benchmarks for speed optimization.
*   **Model Ambiguity:** Clarify what the difference between ordered and unordered graphs is.
*   **Related Work:** Elaboration on single-graph SZIP compared to shuffle coding.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a significant contribution to lossless compression, offering a general and theoretically sound method for compressing unordered data structures. The empirical results are promising, and the release of source code enhances its practical impact. While there are some limitations, particularly regarding computational complexity and the "initial bits" issue, the paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses. With further refinement and analysis, shuffle coding has the potential to become a valuable tool for compressing a wide range of data.

The paper is worthy of acceptance at ICLR.
