OUTPUT:
Following Jeanpierre et al. (2023), this paper presents DenoiseLoc, a novel encoder-decoder model and training paradigm for video activity localization, addressing the challenges posed by ambiguous action boundaries. The core idea revolves around a boundary-denoising approach where the model learns to refine noisy temporal spans towards the ground truth, leading to more precise localization and faster convergence. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on multiple datasets, including the large-scale MAD dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results in several cases.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Approach:** The denoising perspective on video activity localization is a fresh and intuitive approach to tackling boundary ambiguity. The controlled noise injection during training seems to act as a beneficial form of data augmentation.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The paper showcases significant performance gains on QV-Highlights and MAD datasets. The +12.36% average mAP improvement on QV-Highlights is particularly noteworthy. Furthermore, achieving state-of-the-art performance on MAD with fewer predictions than other methods is a valuable contribution.
*   **Well-Structured and Clearly Written:** The paper is generally well-organized and the methodology is clearly explained. The architecture, training process, and loss functions are presented in a comprehensible manner.
*   **Thorough Ablation Studies:** The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the impact of different design choices, such as noise level, decoder design, and query number. These experiments help to validate the effectiveness of each component of the DenoiseLoc model.
*   **Generalizability:** The authors emphasize the generalizability of their method to different video domains, which is a crucial aspect for practical applications.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Exploration of Diffusion:** While the authors explore a diffusion-based extension (DiffusionLoc), they find no significant performance gain over the single-step denoising approach. This section could be strengthened by providing more detailed analysis of why diffusion doesn't improve results in this specific domain. The paper mentions the output is a "lower dimension manifold", but more justification would be helpful.
*   **Comparison to CONE (MAD Dataset):** The paper compares its two-stage process with CONE which is also a two-stage process with details. It would be beneficial to compare the two approaches on a level-playing-field (e.g. both using the first stage from Barrios et al (2023)) to get more accurate comparision of the approaches.
*   **Discussion of R@5 Results:** The paper notes that the Hungarian matcher limits the ability to directly optimize for higher recall values like R@5. A more in-depth discussion of potential solutions or alternative matching algorithms could be beneficial.
*   **Lack of Visualization with random seed:** There should be more detail about the visualiazations with 10 different random seeds in Fig. 6 and 7 and explanation on why seed are more crucial in certain situations.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Investigate Diffusion Further:** Even though the initial experiments with DiffusionLoc didn't yield improvements, exploring different diffusion schedules, noise levels, or architecture modifications might reveal potential benefits.
*   **Clarify the Advantages of Denoising:** Elaborate on why denoising is effective compared to other regularization techniques. Is it primarily acting as data augmentation, or does it have other beneficial effects on the learning process?
*   **Discuss Limitations of MAD Dataset Features:** The authors use existing features for MAD. A brief discussion of the limitations of those features and how they might impact the performance of DenoiseLoc would be valuable.
*   **Address R@5 Optimization:** Briefly discuss alternative matching strategies or loss functions that could be used to improve performance at higher recall values.

**Overall:**

DenoiseLoc presents a significant contribution to the field of video activity localization. The denoising approach is novel and effective, leading to state-of-the-art results on several datasets. While some aspects of the paper could be further strengthened, the work is well-written, thoroughly evaluated, and provides valuable insights into the challenges of temporal action localization. This paper is a strong candidate for acceptance at ICLR 2024.
