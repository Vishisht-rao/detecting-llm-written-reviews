OUTPUT:
Following Grainger et al. (2016), this paper addresses a crucial question in differentially private machine learning: is DPSGD alone sufficient for achieving good performance, particularly in the context of linear classification? The paper provides both theoretical and empirical evidence suggesting that, unlike non-private optimization, feature preprocessing is vital for differentially private linear optimization.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses an Important Question:** The paper tackles a relevant and practical challenge in DP-ML, highlighting a potential limitation of relying solely on DPSGD. The observation that DPSGD may not learn good intermediate features and that preprocessing can improve performance is significant.
*   **Theoretical Contribution:** The paper provides a theoretical counter-example demonstrating that DPSGD can incur a high optimality gap (proportional to the maximum feature norm) without preprocessing. The proposal of DPSGD-F, along with its theoretical guarantee (optimality gap proportional to the feature diameter), is a valuable contribution. The matching (or near-matching) information-theoretic lower bound further strengthens the theoretical results.
*   **Novel Algorithm:** DPSGD-F is a novel algorithm that combines feature preprocessing and DPSGD.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The experimental results on standard image classification datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-100 with pretrained features) demonstrate the practicality of DPSGD-F and its advantage over standard DPSGD in several scenarios. The consistent improvements across different datasets and privacy budgets support the theoretical findings.
*   **Well-Organized and Clear Presentation:** The paper is generally well-organized, with a clear introduction, problem statement, proposed solution, theoretical analysis, and empirical validation. The algorithm description (Algorithm 2) and the step-by-step explanation of DPSGD-F are helpful.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Practical Implementation vs. Theory:** The paper notes a discrepancy between the theoretical analysis, which assumes bounded gradients and no clipping during DPSGD (Algorithm 2), and the practical implementation that utilizes gradient clipping (Algorithm 3). While Algorithm 3's DP is correct and is the commonly practiced methodology, this divergence weakens the direct connection between the theoretical guarantees and the empirical results. A more detailed discussion of this difference and its potential implications would be beneficial. The post-hoc observation that a mean centered datasets has a strong impact does not provide enough rigor.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The paper acknowledges that the hyperparameter tuning process isn't privacy-preserving and that choosing the parameters automatically is a future direction. This is a standard limitation in DP-ML research, but it should be clearly stated that the reported accuracy might be an overestimate of what can be achieved in a truly private setting.
*   **Limited Scope of Experiments:** While the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DPSGD-F on image classification tasks, extending the empirical evaluation to larger datasets and more complex models (e.g., deep neural networks beyond the last layer fine-tuning) would further strengthen the findings. The current experiments show that the smaller the average distance from a point in the data set from the mean improves performance more so than the diameter, however a strong motivation for why this is, is lacking.
*   **Clarity of Proofs (Minor):** Some of the proof steps in the appendix could benefit from additional explanations or justifications. For instance, clarifying the connection between the intermediate lemmas and the overall proof of Theorem 1 would improve readability.
*   **Related Works on Mean Estimation:** The paper references Huang et al. (2021) for private mean estimation but could benefit from mentioning other relevant works in this area, especially those focusing on dimension-independent or robust mean estimation under DP.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address the Gap Between Theory and Practice:** Provide a more in-depth discussion of the differences between Algorithm 2 (feature clipping) and Algorithm 3 (gradient clipping). Explore the potential impact of gradient clipping on the theoretical guarantees of DPSGD-F or consider alternative theoretical analysis that aligns better with the practical implementation.
*   **Discuss Privacy Accounting:** Elaborate on the choice of the PLD accountant and its advantages over other privacy accounting methods (e.g., moments accountant). Justify why PLD accountant is superior for Algorithm 3, given its clipping properties.
*   **Privacy-Preserving Hyperparameter Tuning:** Acknowledge the privacy implications of hyperparameter tuning and propose potential solutions or future research directions for addressing this issue.
*   **Extend Experiments:** Conduct experiments on larger datasets and with more complex models to assess the scalability and generalizability of DPSGD-F.
*   **Clarify Proofs:** Add more detailed explanations or justifications to the proof steps in the appendix, especially for less common readers.
*   **Broader Literature Review:** Include a more comprehensive overview of related work, particularly in the area of private mean estimation and robust DP.

**Overall:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of differentially private machine learning. It identifies a critical limitation of relying solely on DPSGD for linear classification and proposes a novel algorithm, DPSGD-F, that addresses this limitation. The combination of theoretical analysis and empirical validation provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of DPSGD-F. While there are some weaknesses, the strengths of the paper outweigh its limitations. This paper is suitable for publication at ICLR, with revisions to address the suggested improvements.
