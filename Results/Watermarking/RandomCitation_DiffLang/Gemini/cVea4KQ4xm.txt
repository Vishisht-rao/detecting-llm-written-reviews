OUTPUT:
Following Widmer et al. (2022), this paper presents an interesting approach to fairness in machine learning, moving beyond the common demographic parity metric. The core idea of formalizing equal treatment by considering explanation distributions based on Shapley values is novel and potentially impactful. The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and provides both theoretical justifications and empirical evaluations for the proposed method. The release of the "explanationspace" package further enhances the contribution by providing a practical tool for researchers and practitioners.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The paper's central contribution is the formalization of equal treatment using explanation distributions, a concept that offers a more nuanced understanding of fairness than demographic parity.
*   **Theoretical Foundation:** The paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis, including lemmas and examples, to support the proposed approach and highlight its advantages over existing fairness metrics. The discussion on the relationship between equal treatment, equal outcomes, and fairness of the input data is particularly insightful.
*   **Empirical Evaluation:** The experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets (ACS Income data) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting and explaining unequal treatment. The analysis of feature importance provides valuable insights into the drivers of unfairness.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors emphasize reproducibility by providing access to the data, code, and documentation. The release of the "explanationspace" package is commendable.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is well-written and easy to follow, even for readers who are not experts in fairness or explainable AI.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Scope of Explanation Methods:** The paper primarily focuses on Shapley values as the explanation method. While Shapley values have strong theoretical properties, it would be beneficial to explore the applicability of the proposed framework with other explanation techniques, such as LIME, counterfactual explanations, or rule-based methods, as briefly touched upon in the limitations. The appendix shows a comparison to LIME, but it could be expanded.
*   **Complexity of Shapley Value Calculation:** The assumption of exact Shapley value calculation might be unrealistic in practice, especially for complex models or large datasets. While the experimental section acknowledges the use of approximations, a more detailed discussion on the impact of approximation errors on the proposed fairness metric would be valuable.
*   **Limited Normative Discussion:** While the paper explicitly avoids a normative discussion on which philosophical paradigm to pursue, a brief exploration of the potential societal implications of prioritizing equal treatment over equal opportunity or other fairness notions could enrich the paper. This is partially mitigated by the paper's explicit call for further "techno-philosophical discussions" in the conclusion.
*   **Lack of Comparison to Other Explainable Fairness Methods:** The related works section has a comparison, but is lacking in terms of empirical validation of alternatives.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand the exploration of other explanation methods:** While Shapley values provide a strong theoretical foundation, investigating the application of the ET metric with LIME, counterfactual explanations, or other methods could broaden the paper's impact.
*   **Discuss the impact of Shapley value approximation errors:** Acknowledge the limitations of using approximate Shapley values and discuss their potential impact on the accuracy and reliability of the proposed fairness metric.
*   **Briefly discuss societal implications:** While avoiding a deep dive into normative ethics, a brief discussion on the potential societal consequences of prioritizing equal treatment could enhance the paper's relevance and impact.
*   **Elaborate on the limitations of tabular data:** Expand on the limitations section with a mention of how current research only covers tabular data formats.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of fair machine learning. The proposed formalization of equal treatment using explanation distributions is novel and well-supported by theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. The release of the "explanationspace" package further enhances the paper's impact and promotes reproducibility. Addressing the minor weaknesses mentioned above would further strengthen the paper and broaden its appeal. I recommend acceptance, pending the authors' response to the comments above.
