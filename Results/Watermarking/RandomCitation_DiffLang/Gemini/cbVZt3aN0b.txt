OUTPUT:
Following Behrens et al. (2020), this paper tackles a relevant and under-explored challenge in continual learning: label delay. The authors convincingly argue that the common assumption of instantaneous label availability in standard continual learning settings is often unrealistic in real-world applications. They introduce a new continual learning framework that explicitly models label delay, where labels arrive *d* time steps after the corresponding data. The paper presents compelling experimental results, demonstrates the limitations of existing SSL and TTA techniques in this context, and proposes a simple yet effective memory rehearsal strategy, Importance Weighted Memory Sampling (IWMS), to mitigate the performance degradation caused by label delay.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The explicit modeling of label delay is a significant and novel contribution to the continual learning literature. It addresses a practical limitation of existing approaches and opens up new avenues for research.
*   **Thorough Experimental Evaluation:** The paper boasts extensive experiments (1060 GPU days) on large-scale datasets (CLOC and CGLM). The ablation studies and sensitivity analyses provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the proposed method and the challenges posed by label delay. The normalization of the computational budget is important for fair comparisons.
*   **Clear Problem Definition and Formulation:** The problem is clearly defined, and the proposed framework is well-formalized. The explanation of the delayed label setting is easy to follow.
*   **Simple and Effective Solution:** IWMS is a surprisingly simple and computationally efficient approach that significantly outperforms existing methods. The intuition behind IWMS is well-explained and the implementation details are sufficient.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is well-written, easy to understand, and logically organized. The related work section adequately covers relevant research in continual learning, self-supervised learning, and test-time adaptation.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Novelty (IWMS):** While effective, the IWMS method, at its core, leverages existing memory rehearsal techniques and similarity measures. The novelty primarily lies in its application to the label delay problem and the specific weighting scheme based on predictions and feature similarity. More discussion on how it compares to other similarity based replay methods in the literature would be good.
*   **Lack of Theoretical Analysis:** The paper lacks a theoretical analysis of the proposed framework and the IWMS method. While the empirical results are strong, a theoretical understanding of the method's convergence properties and generalization ability would further strengthen the paper.
*   **CLOC Performance:** The performance on the CLOC dataset is relatively low across all methods, and the authors acknowledge the noise in the data. It is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of IWMS on CLOC due to these limitations. The visualization of incorrectly recalled images helps explain this issue, but it also raises questions about the suitability of CLOC for evaluating continual learning algorithms.
*   **Ablation of individual components of IWMS:** While the Ablation on Sampling strategy provides some insights, the paper would be further strengthened by ablating different components of the IWMS method itself. For instance, how much does the prediction based pre-filtering contribute compared to just using feature similarity?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand Discussion of IWMS Novelty:** Provide a more in-depth discussion of the novelty of IWMS in relation to existing similarity-based memory rehearsal methods.
*   **Consider Adding a Simple Theoretical Analysis:** Even a simple analysis could help to strengthen the paper by offering some theoretical justification for the effectiveness of IWMS.
*   **Address Limitations of CLOC Data:** Acknowledge the limitations of the CLOC dataset and discuss potential strategies for mitigating the impact of noise on the experimental results.
*   **Ablate IWMS components:** Ablate the individual components of the IWMS method, specifically focusing on the prediction-based pre-filtering step.
*   **Discuss limitations of IWMS:** Although it is a good improvement over other methods, IWMS is still far away from "offline" learning. Mentioning limitations of IWMS might make the work more complete and suggest future research directions.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that addresses an important and often overlooked aspect of continual learning. The introduction of the label delay framework is a significant contribution, and the IWMS method provides a practical and effective solution to the challenges posed by label delay. Despite some limitations, the paper is well-written, well-organized, and supported by extensive experimental results. This paper is worthy of acceptance.
