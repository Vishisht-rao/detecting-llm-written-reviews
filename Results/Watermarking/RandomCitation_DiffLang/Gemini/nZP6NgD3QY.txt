OUTPUT:
Following Vos et al. (2014), this paper introduces AdaMerging, a novel adaptive model merging technique for multi-task learning (MTL) that aims to address the performance degradation often observed when directly merging pre-trained models via task arithmetic. The paper tackles a relevant and timely problem in the context of foundation models, where individual fine-tuned models are often available without access to the original training data. AdaMerging leverages entropy minimization on unlabeled test samples to autonomously learn task-wise or layer-wise merging coefficients, essentially providing an unsupervised task arithmetic scheme. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments across eight tasks, showcasing improvements in performance, generalization, and robustness compared to state-of-the-art task arithmetic merging schemes like Task Arithmetic and Ties-Merging.

**Strengths:**

*   **Relevance and Significance:** The paper addresses a critical challenge in modern MTL, namely, effectively merging pre-trained models without relying on original training data, a scenario increasingly common due to the prevalence of fine-tuned models and data privacy concerns.
*   **Novelty:** The AdaMerging technique offers a fresh perspective on model merging by introducing adaptive merging coefficients learned through unsupervised entropy minimization. This is a significant departure from previous approaches that often rely on fixed or heuristically determined coefficients.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The paper presents extensive experimental results across eight tasks, demonstrating consistent and significant performance improvements compared to existing methods. Furthermore, the evaluation of generalization and robustness adds significant value to the contribution, highlighting the practical benefits of AdaMerging.
*   **Well-Motivated:** The paper provides a clear and convincing motivation for the proposed method. The authors thoroughly discuss the limitations of existing task arithmetic approaches, particularly the sensitivity to merging coefficients, and justify the use of entropy minimization as a surrogate objective. The correlation analysis between entropy and prediction loss provides strong evidence to support this choice.
*   **Clarity and Organization:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The introduction clearly outlines the problem, the proposed solution, and the key contributions. The methodology section provides a detailed explanation of AdaMerging, and the experimental setup and results are presented in a clear and concise manner.
*   **Comprehensive Analysis:** The ablation studies and analysis of task relationships, the impact of the amount of test data, the comparison with the supervised version, parameter cost, and time cost, all contribute to a strong overall analysis.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Reliance on Unlabeled Test Data:** While the paper demonstrates that AdaMerging can perform well even with limited unlabeled test data, the requirement for *any* test data could still be a limitation in some practical scenarios. Further discussion on the minimal amount of data needed for effective adaptation and potential alternatives when no test data is available would be beneficial.
*   **Computational Complexity:** Although the authors provide time cost analysis, more details on the computational complexity of AdaMerging, specifically regarding the entropy calculation and gradient-based optimization of the merging coefficients, would be valuable. A comparison to the computational cost of calculating the Fisher Information matrix used in Fisher Merging would also be useful.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion of the hyperparameters used in the AdaMerging algorithm (e.g., learning rate, batch size) and their impact on performance. A sensitivity analysis of these parameters would enhance the reproducibility and usability of the method.
*   **Limited Architecture Diversity:** Experiments focus heavily on ViT architectures. While the results are convincing, exploring the effectiveness of AdaMerging with other architectures (e.g., CNNs, Transformers for NLP) would broaden the scope and applicability of the method.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address the limitations of the test data requirement:** Discuss potential solutions for situations where no test data is available or further reduce the data requirement. Explore zero-shot transfer or other domain adaptation techniques.
*   **Provide more detailed computational complexity analysis.**
*   **Include a hyperparameter sensitivity analysis.**
*   **Expand the experimental evaluation to include a more diverse set of architectures and tasks.**
*   **Clarify the code release:** Provide a clearer indication of how to access the code (e.g., a specific URL).

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective technique for multi-task model merging. The empirical results are compelling, and the paper addresses a timely and relevant problem. While there are some areas for improvement, the overall contribution is significant, and the paper is well-suited for publication at ICLR.
