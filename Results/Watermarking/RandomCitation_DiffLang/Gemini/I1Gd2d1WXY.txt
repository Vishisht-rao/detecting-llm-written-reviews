OUTPUT:
Following Beacham et al. (2020), this paper introduces Adaptive Resolution Residual Networks (ARRNs), a novel architecture designed to address the challenge of varying signal resolutions in deep learning models. The core idea is to enable a single network to operate effectively at different resolutions without retraining, thereby improving robustness and computational efficiency. The authors achieve this through two key components: Laplacian residuals and Laplacian dropout.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The concept of adapting network resolution using Laplacian residuals and dropout is novel and potentially valuable. The paper clearly articulates the problem of fixed-resolution networks and proposes a compelling solution.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation for ARRNs, drawing connections to Laplacian pyramids and residual networks. The mathematical formulations for Laplacian residuals and dropout are well-defined. The explanation of rediscretization and its advantages is clear.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The experiments demonstrate the benefits of ARRNs, particularly in terms of robustness to low-resolution signals and reduced inference time. The comparison with existing convolutional network families strengthens the paper's claims. The investigation of adaptation time is a plus.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is well-written and organized. The introduction clearly states the problem and the proposed solution. The sections on Laplacian pyramids and residuals are informative. The figures effectively illustrate the concepts and experimental results.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors provide sufficient implementation details (e.g., Kaiser-windowed Whittaker-Shannon interpolation) to facilitate reproducibility. The architecture details are promised in the appendix, which should provide further support.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity of Explanation in Relation to Neural Operators and Implicit Neural Representations:** While the authors attempt to distinguish ARRNs from neural operators and implicit neural representations, the explanation could be further refined. Specifically, while they argue that ARRNs avoid the complexity of maintaining equivalence between continuous and discrete forms in neural operators, and the challenges of learning maps between distinct continuous functions in implicit neural representations, a more direct and intuitive explanation could benefit the reader. This could involve expanding on *why* Laplacian residuals allow them to circumvent these issues, beyond simply stating that they do.
*   **Laplacian Dropout Justification:** While Laplacian dropout is presented as a crucial component, the intuitive justification could be strengthened. The equivalence between randomly zeroing out residuals and lowering signal resolution should be elaborated on. It's not immediately obvious *why* this equivalence holds, and a more detailed explanation would improve the reader's understanding. A clearer explanation on why standard dropout does not work would add value to the paper.
*   **Filter Approximation Impact:** The experimental section mentions that the approximate filters used by the implementation allow a small quantity of information to bleed through. While the authors provide a potential explanation for the performance degradation with rediscretization in the absence of Laplacian dropout, a more rigorous analysis of the impact of the filter approximation on the overall performance of ARRNs would be valuable.
*   **Limited Scope of Experiments:** The experiments primarily focus on image classification tasks. While these are relevant, exploring the performance of ARRNs on other signal types (e.g., audio, volumetric data) would broaden the impact of the paper. The "Future Work" section mentions potential applications in real-time applications and segmentation tasks; including even a preliminary investigation in one of these areas would substantially improve the paper.
*   **Missing Appendix:** The paper refers to Appendix A.1 for ARRN architecture details. This appendix is crucial for understanding and potentially reproducing the results. Its absence weakens the submission.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand Explanation of Differences from Related Work:** Provide a more intuitive and detailed explanation of how ARRNs differ from and overcome the limitations of neural operators and implicit neural representations.
*   **Strengthen Laplacian Dropout Justification:** Offer a clearer explanation of the equivalence between randomly dropping residuals and lowering resolution. Explain the differences to standard dropout methods.
*   **Analyze Filter Approximation Impact:** Include a more rigorous analysis of the effects of the filter approximation on ARRN performance. Consider exploring different filter approximations.
*   **Broaden Experimental Scope:** If possible, include experiments on other signal types or tasks (e.g., audio classification, image segmentation).
*   **Include Appendix A.1:** The architecture details in the appendix are essential.
*   **Proofread Carefully:** There are some minor grammatical errors (e.g., missing articles) that should be corrected.

**Overall:**

This is a promising paper that introduces a novel and potentially valuable approach to adaptive resolution deep learning. The theoretical foundation is sound, and the experimental results are encouraging. Addressing the weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements would significantly strengthen the paper and increase its impact. I am leaning towards acceptance, contingent on the inclusion of the appendix and clarification of the aforementioned points.
