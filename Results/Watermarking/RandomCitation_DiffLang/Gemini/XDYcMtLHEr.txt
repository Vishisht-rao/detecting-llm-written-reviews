OUTPUT:
Following Knecht et al. (2015), this paper presents a novel multi-agent architecture for learning emergent communication protocols, focusing on robustness in noisy environments and the ability to handle multi-round interactions. The authors introduce a new referential game, the Multi-Round Indecisive Lewis Game (MRILG), which extends the classic Lewis Game (LG) by adding noise to the communication channel and allowing for multiple rounds of interaction between the Speaker and Listener. The paper demonstrates that agents trained in the MRILG can learn robust communication protocols capable of generalizing to both noisy and noiseless environments, outperforming agents trained on the original LG.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The introduction of the MRILG and the associated Listener architecture with the "I don't know" action is a significant contribution. This allows for a more nuanced and realistic model of communication where agents can request further information. The focus on noisy communication channels is also a valuable addition to the emergent communication literature.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and clearly explains the proposed architecture, the MRILG, and the learning strategy. The inclusion of figures illustrating the Speaker and Listener architectures is helpful.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The authors provide a thorough evaluation of the MRILG and its variants, comparing it to the original LG and other intermediate versions. The ablation studies in the appendix further strengthen the empirical evidence. The scaling of candidate size is also an important and informative experiment.
*   **Relevance:** The paper addresses a relevant and important problem in emergent communication, namely the lack of robustness and generalization in learned communication protocols. The work has implications for human-robot communication and the understanding of language evolution.
*   **Strong Experimental Results**: the experimental results clearly show that the proposed approach, MRILG, can achieve robust communication in noisy environments without losing general properties.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Related Work:** While the paper cites relevant works, a more in-depth discussion of existing approaches to handling noise in emergent communication or multi-round interactions could strengthen the paper. For example, while Ueda & Washio (2021) is mentioned, the nuances of their adversarial approach and the specific differences could be elaborated further. Also, more modern techniques of handling RL like PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) could be discussed and compared to.

*   **Clarity of "I Don't Know" Reward:** The justification for the specific reward structure for the "I don't know" action could be further elaborated. While the paper discusses the potential pitfalls of different reward values, a more formal analysis or intuitive explanation of why the chosen values are effective would be beneficial.

*   **Sample Efficiency Trade-off:** While the paper acknowledges the trade-off between performance and sample efficiency, a more detailed analysis of the factors contributing to this trade-off could be provided. Could the architecture be optimized further to improve sample efficiency without sacrificing performance?

*   **Limited Noise Types:** While the noisy communication channel is a strong addition, the paper only focuses on a single type of noise. Exploring other types of noise, such as token substitution or adversarial attacks, could further demonstrate the robustness of the proposed architecture. As the authors suggests in future work.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand the Related Work:** Provide a more comprehensive overview of existing approaches to handling noise and multi-round interactions in emergent communication.
*   **Justify Reward Structure:** Provide a more detailed justification for the reward structure used for the "I don't know" action.
*   **Analyze Sample Efficiency:** Analyze the factors contributing to the sample efficiency trade-off and explore potential optimizations.
*   **Explore Different Noise Types:** Evaluate the robustness of the architecture against different types of noise.
*   **Include qualitative analysis:** it would be interesting to have some qualitative analysis of the emergent language to understand how the agents are encoding information in the presence of noise.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a valuable contribution to the field of emergent communication. The introduction of the MRILG and the associated Listener architecture is a novel and well-motivated approach to learning robust communication protocols. The comprehensive evaluation provides strong empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of the proposed method. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper.

I recommend this paper for acceptance.
