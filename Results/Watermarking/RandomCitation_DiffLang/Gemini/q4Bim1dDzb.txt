OUTPUT:
Following Lough et al. (2023), this paper introduces UniVoxel, a novel framework for fast inverse rendering based on unified voxelization of scene representations. The core idea is to encode the scene into a latent volumetric representation, composed of an SDF field for geometry and a semantic field for materials and illumination. This explicit voxelization approach aims to overcome the computational bottlenecks associated with implicit neural scene representations, particularly deep MLPs, used in previous inverse rendering methods. The authors propose representing incident light radiance with Spherical Gaussians (SG) and integrating the illumination modeling within the unified voxelization framework. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate a significant reduction in per-scene training time compared to existing methods, while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality.

**Strengths:**

*   **Improved Training Efficiency:** The primary strength of this paper is the significant reduction in training time compared to previous inverse rendering approaches. The shift from implicit neural representations to explicit voxel-based representations leads to substantial performance gains. The reported 40x and 12x speedups over MII and Nvdiffrec-mc, respectively, are impressive.
*   **Unified Voxelization Framework:** The proposed UniVoxel framework provides a coherent way to model geometry, materials, and illumination in a unified manner. This reduces the complexity and computational cost of modeling each property individually.
*   **Spherical Gaussian Illumination Model:** The use of Spherical Gaussians for representing incident light radiance is well-motivated. It allows for more efficient modeling of illumination, including direct and indirect lighting, compared to methods based on environment maps and multi-bounce ray tracing. The integration of the SG parameters into the semantic field learning process is a notable contribution.
*   **Strong Experimental Results:** The paper provides a comprehensive set of experiments on both synthetic (MII dataset) and real-world (NeRD dataset) scenes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of UniVoxel in terms of reconstruction quality and training time. The ablation studies offer insights into the importance of different components of the framework, particularly the illumination modeling.
*   **Clarity of Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and clearly explains the proposed method and its advantages. The figures effectively illustrate the UniVoxel framework and its components.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Memory Footprint:**  The paper acknowledges in the appendix that, similar to other explicit representation methods, UniVoxel suffers from a relatively large memory footprint.  While the speed improvements are significant, the memory requirements could limit its applicability in certain scenarios. The paper should address this limitation more prominently in the main text. Quantifying the memory usage would be beneficial.
*   **Limited Novelty in Voxelization Itself:** The paper leverages voxelization techniques that have been explored in other contexts (e.g., DVGO, TensoRF). While the *application* of voxelization to inverse rendering in a unified manner is novel, the paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion of how it builds upon and differs from existing voxel-based representation methods.
*   **Lack of Quantitative Comparisons on Real-World Data:** While the qualitative results on the NeRD dataset are encouraging, the absence of ground truth data prevents a quantitative evaluation. The paper could benefit from additional experiments on real datasets with available ground truth or perceptual studies to better assess the realism of the reconstructions.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address Memory Usage More Explicitly:**  Move the discussion of memory limitations from the appendix to the main paper and quantify memory usage in the experimental results. Compare memory usage with other methods, if possible. Consider discussing potential approaches for reducing the memory footprint (e.g., sparse voxel grids, adaptive resolution).
*   **Elaborate on the Relationship to Existing Voxelization Techniques:**  Provide a more detailed comparison of UniVoxel to related voxel-based methods like DVGO and TensoRF. Highlight the specific adaptations and innovations that are necessary for the inverse rendering task.
*   **Consider Perceptual Studies:**  For the real-world datasets, consider conducting a user study to evaluate the perceptual realism of the reconstructed scenes compared to other methods.
*   **Discuss Limitations of SG Illumination Modeling:** While SG is generally efficient, it may struggle with complex, high-frequency lighting scenarios or very large numbers of light sources. Acknowledge potential limitations of SG.
*   **Code Release:** Emphasize the intent to release code to promote reproducibility.

**Overall:**

UniVoxel presents a significant advancement in inverse rendering by leveraging explicit voxelization for efficient scene representation learning. The proposed unified framework and Spherical Gaussian illumination model enable substantial reductions in training time without sacrificing reconstruction quality. While the memory footprint and reliance on existing voxelization techniques are limitations, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field and is likely to be of interest to the ICLR community.
