OUTPUT:
Following Mitchell et al. (2021), this paper proposes a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm called Actor-Predicts-Critic (APC) within the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework. The key idea is to train the actor to predict the global representations learned by the centralized critic, using only local observations. This allows agents to leverage global information during decentralized execution, addressing limitations of purely CTDE methods and potentially mitigating the non-stationarity problem. The paper presents experimental results on StarCraftII (SMAC), Google Research Football (GRF), and Multi-Agent Mujoco, demonstrating that APC outperforms strong baselines like MAT-Dec, MAPPO, and fine-tuned QMIX. Ablation studies are also conducted to validate the effectiveness of predicting global representations and utilizing historical information.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The approach of predicting critic's global representations from local observations is a relatively novel way to incorporate global information into decentralized policies in CTDE MARL.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The introduction clearly motivates the problem and the proposed solution. The method section provides a detailed description of the APC algorithm, including the actor-critic architecture and the loss functions.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The experiments are conducted on a variety of challenging benchmarks (SMAC, GRF, and Multi-Agent Mujoco), demonstrating the general applicability of the proposed method. The results consistently show that APC outperforms strong baselines. The ablation studies further solidify the contribution by showing the importance of the prediction loss and GRU usage.
*   **Strong Baselines:** The paper compares against strong MARL baselines including MAT-Dec, MAPPO, and fine-tuned QMIX, which makes the comparison meaningful and impactful.
*   **Statistical Significance:** The use of t-tests to demonstrate the statistical significance of the results adds rigor to the empirical evaluation.
*   **Addressing limitations:** The paper acknowledges limitations of the work such as the performance gap between APC and sequential decision-making methods and the mitigation rather than prevention of the non-stationarity problem.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Theoretical Analysis:** The paper lacks a theoretical analysis of the convergence properties or sample complexity of the APC algorithm. While the empirical results are strong, a theoretical justification would further strengthen the contribution.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The paper mentions empirical setting of some hyperparameters. Detailed hyperparameter tuning and sensitivity analysis could make the experimental results more robust.
*   **Justification of Design Choices:** The paper could provide more justification for certain design choices, such as using self-attention in the critic and GRU in the actor. While these are common techniques, explaining *why* they are particularly well-suited for this problem would be beneficial.
*   **Distance Function:** The use of Euclidean distance to compute prediction loss is a simple choice. The authors could consider and discuss alternative distance functions (e.g., cosine similarity).
*   **Comparison with Agent Modeling Methods:** While the paper distinguishes itself from agent modeling approaches, a more detailed comparison, perhaps including experiments with a relevant agent modeling baseline, would be valuable.  Specifically, what advantages does predicting the critic's representation have compared to explicitly modeling other agent behaviors?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Theoretical Analysis:** Add a section on the theoretical analysis of the APC algorithm.
*   **Hyperparameter Analysis:** Include a discussion of hyperparameter sensitivity and the tuning process.
*   **Justification of Design Choices:** Provide more detailed justification for the use of self-attention and GRU.
*   **Explore Alternative Distance Functions:** Discuss and potentially experiment with alternative distance functions for the prediction loss.
*   **Deeper Comparison with Agent Modeling:**  Include a more in-depth comparison (both theoretical and experimental) with relevant agent modeling methods.
*   **Scalability Analysis:** Briefly discuss the scalability of APC to larger numbers of agents and more complex environments.

**Overall:**

The paper presents a solid contribution to the field of MARL. The APC algorithm is a novel and effective approach to leveraging global information in decentralized policies. The empirical results are strong and the paper is well-written and easy to follow. Addressing the weaknesses mentioned above would further strengthen the paper and make it an even more valuable contribution to the ICLR community. I am leaning toward acceptance.
