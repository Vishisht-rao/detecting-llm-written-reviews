OUTPUT:
Following Bisson et al. (2024), this paper tackles the challenging problem of computing Team-Maxmin Equilibrium with Coordination device (TMECor) in sequential Adversarial Team Games (ATGs). The core contribution is a novel TB-DAG Column Generation (DCG) framework designed to overcome the limitations of existing Column Generation (CG) algorithms and TB-DAG-based approaches.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Relevance:** The paper addresses a significant problem in computational game theory, particularly relevant in multi-agent systems where optimal coordination is crucial.
*   **Novelty:** The proposed DCG framework is a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both CG and TB-DAG representations while mitigating their weaknesses. The key idea of computing a best response in the original game and then transforming it into the TB-DAG form is innovative.
*   **Theoretical Justification:** The paper provides a theoretical analysis demonstrating that DCG converges exponentially faster than state-of-the-art CG algorithms. This is a crucial theoretical contribution.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The experimental results are compelling, showing that DCG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by at least two orders of magnitude and can solve games that were previously unsolvable. The experiments are comprehensive, considering various algorithms and game instances.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The introduction clearly motivates the problem and highlights the contributions. The explanations of the TB-DAG and the DCG algorithm are relatively clear, aided by the example in Figure 1.
*   **Potential Impact:** The paper has the potential to significantly advance the field of multi-agent learning by providing a more scalable and efficient algorithm for computing TMECor. The connection to PSRO is promising.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Complexity:** The paper deals with complex concepts (extensive-form games, imperfect recall, TB-DAGs, column generation). This makes it difficult to fully grasp the intricacies of the algorithm and the theoretical results without significant background knowledge. While the authors attempt to provide necessary definitions, some sections remain dense and challenging.
*   **Justification for Pure BRO:** While the authors motivate the use of a pure Best Response Oracle (BRO) to reduce transformation costs, the detailed benefits compared to a randomized BRO could be further elaborated. More insights on when the pure BRO is most effective would strengthen the argument. Also, the exact time and space complexities of the transformation step need to be clearly specified.
*   **Limitations Section:** The "Limitations" section could be expanded. While acknowledging differences in runtime due to different settings is important, it would be beneficial to explicitly state the algorithm's limitations, such as sensitivity to certain game parameters or potential bottlenecks in the transformation step.
*   **Algorithm Details:** While Algorithm 1 provides a high-level overview of TB-DAG expansion, more specific details on the implementation and optimization of the BRO (Program 3) would be valuable.
*   **Clarity on Implementation:** The statement "we do not perform optimization tricks in Zhang et al. (2022c) after generating the TB-DAG" needs a better explanation. What are those tricks and why are they not used here?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Enhanced Intuition:** Provide more intuitive explanations of the key concepts, perhaps with simpler examples or analogies. Visual aids could be very helpful.
*   **Elaborate on Pure BRO Benefits:**  Quantify the transformation cost reduction achieved by using the pure BRO compared to a randomized BRO, possibly with theoretical bounds or additional empirical analysis.
*   **Expand Limitations Section:**  Discuss potential limitations of the DCG framework, such as its sensitivity to game parameters, potential bottlenecks in the transformation step, or cases where it might not outperform other algorithms.
*   **Clarify Algorithm Details:** Provide more specific details on the implementation and optimization of the BRO (Program 3), including complexity and algorithmic choices.
*   **Address Algorithm 1 shortcomings:** What "optimization tricks in Zhang et al. (2022c)" are being referred to and why are they not implemented?
*   **Ablation study on the "DCG" parts:** While the paper argues for the importance of the transformation step, it is not entirely clear how significant this step is. An ablation study by removing this step could have more directly shown the importance of it.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of computational game theory. The proposed DCG framework is a novel and effective approach for computing TMECor in ATGs. The theoretical analysis and experimental results are compelling. Despite some areas for improvement, the paper is well-written and has the potential to significantly impact the field. I recommend acceptance, conditional on addressing the points mentioned above.
