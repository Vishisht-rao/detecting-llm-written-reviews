OUTPUT:
Following Colgan et al. (2016), this paper introduces "Bespoke Solvers," a novel framework for training custom ODE solvers specifically tailored to pre-trained generative flow models. The core idea revolves around learning an efficient, order-consistent solver that significantly reduces the Number of Function Evaluations (NFE) required for sampling without sacrificing generation quality. This is achieved by optimizing a parametric family of ODE solvers via transformed sampling paths. The transformations, parameterized by a small number of learnable parameters, include time reparameterization and a scaling function. A key contribution is a tractable loss function that bounds the global truncation error, enabling parallel computation and efficient training.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The "Bespoke Solvers" framework presents a fresh perspective on improving the sampling efficiency of flow-based generative models. The approach of learning a custom solver tailored to a specific pre-trained model is innovative and potentially impactful. The results, demonstrating significant FID improvements with low NFE, highlight the practical significance of the method.
*   **Theoretical Foundation:** The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation for the proposed framework. The concept of transformed sampling paths is well-defined, and the derivation of the transformed vector field is clearly presented. The consistency theorem (Theorem 2.2) is crucial, guaranteeing convergence to the pre-trained model's distribution as the number of steps increases. The theorem showing the equivalence of Gaussian paths and scale-time transformations (Theorem 2.3) provides strong justification for the choice of transformation.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The paper presents comprehensive experimental results on various datasets (CIFAR10, ImageNet-64, ImageNet-128, AFHQ-256) and model architectures (Flow Matching, Diffusion Models), showcasing the versatility and effectiveness of Bespoke Solvers. The quantitative comparisons against existing dedicated solvers and distillation techniques are convincing. The ablation studies (loss ablation, scale-time ablation, transfer learning) provide valuable insights into the importance of different components of the framework. The visualizations of learned parameters are helpful in understanding the effect of the Bespoke approach. Qualitative results also showcase the improvement in the fidelity of samples obtained using the proposed approach.
*   **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The problem is clearly defined, the proposed solution is explained in detail, and the experimental results are presented in a convincing manner. The use of figures and tables effectively complements the text. The inclusion of detailed implementation details and proofs in the appendices enhances the reproducibility of the work.
*   **Loss Derivation & Optimization:** The authors present a clearly derived loss function that provides an upper bound to the RMSE, which allows for parallel computation over the steps, helping considerably reduce memory consumption.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Computational Cost of Ground Truth:** Training requires solving the original ODE with high accuracy (e.g., RK45) to obtain the "ground truth" trajectory, which may be computationally expensive for very large models or complex ODEs. While the paper mentions that Bespoke solvers train in roughly 1% of the original model training time, the absolute time required could still be significant for large models. Some further analysis into the sensitivity to accuracy of ground truth ODE solvers is needed.
*   **Generality of Learned Solvers:** The paper acknowledges that a limitation is the requirement of separate training for each target NFE. While the ablation on transferring a solver to a different resolution is interesting, it shows that the transferred solver is suboptimal. Further investigation into techniques for training a single Bespoke solver that generalizes across different NFE values would be valuable.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** While LÏ„ is fixed to 1 in experiments, how sensitive is performance to the hyperparameter value? Further studies should be presented that analyze this point.
*   **Comparison to Distillation:** While the paper highlights the benefits of Bespoke Solvers compared to distillation (consistency, lower training cost), distillation remains a strong competitor in terms of sample quality. Further exploration of combining Bespoke Solvers with distillation techniques could potentially lead to even better performance.

**Minor Comments/Suggestions:**

*   In the abstract, it would be beneficial to explicitly state the order of the "order consistent" solver.
*   Figure 1 could benefit from a clearer indication of what the axes of the 2D PCA plane represent.
*   The term "GT FID" can be confusing. Consider using "Target FID" or "Full NFE FID" to represent the FID of the pre-trained model with a high NFE solver.
*   The paper references "ima" for ImageNet recommendations. Clarify what "ima" refers to, or provide a more specific citation.
*   Provide more details on why the CUDA utilization is low, so that training occurs in roughly 1% of the time of model training.
*   The formatting in Table 2 should be corrected. GT-FID/% is not properly rendering.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that introduces a novel and effective framework for improving the sampling efficiency of generative flow models. The theoretical foundations are solid, the experimental results are compelling, and the paper is generally well-written. While some limitations remain, the "Bespoke Solvers" approach represents a significant advance in the field and has the potential to enable new applications of flow-based generative models. I recommend this paper for acceptance.
