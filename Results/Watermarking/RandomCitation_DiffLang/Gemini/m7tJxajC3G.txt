OUTPUT:
Following Bess et al. (2023), this paper presents FedCDH, a novel constraint-based approach for Federated Causal Discovery from Heterogeneous data. The core idea revolves around using summary statistics as a proxy for raw data during causal discovery, addressing privacy concerns in federated settings. The authors introduce a surrogate variable to account for data heterogeneity across clients and propose a federated conditional independence test (FCIT) and a federated independent change principle (FICP) for causal skeleton discovery and direction determination. A key strength lies in the non-parametric nature of FCIT and FICP, allowing the method to handle arbitrary causal models without restrictive assumptions about functional forms. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of FedCDH compared to existing FCD methods.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses a critical problem:** Federated causal discovery is a relevant and challenging area, and this paper tackles the limitations of existing methods regarding assumptions of homogeneity and identifiable functional causal models.
*   **Novel approach:** The use of summary statistics and the introduction of a surrogate variable for heterogeneity are innovative and well-motivated.
*   **Non-parametric methods:** FCIT and FICP are a significant advantage, broadening the applicability of the method to various causal models.
*   **Empirical validation:** Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of FedCDH. The thoroughness of the experiments (varying variables, clients, and samples) is commendable.
*   **Code Availability:** Releasing the code enhances reproducibility and allows others to build upon this work.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Communication Cost Limitations:** As acknowledged by the authors, the summary statistics might not always lead to significant reductions in communication costs, particularly when sample sizes are small or the hidden dimension is large. The paper could benefit from a more thorough analysis of when this is the case, potentially with guidelines for determining appropriate hidden dimension sizes given certain data characteristics.
*   **Horizontal Partitioning Restriction:** The method's limitation to horizontally-partitioned data restricts its applicability. While acknowledged, it is a significant limitation and should be emphasized more in the abstract and introduction.
*   **Secure Computation Overhead:** The paper mentions secure computation techniques to further enhance privacy. However, it acknowledges the computational overhead associated with these techniques. A brief discussion of the trade-offs between privacy and computational cost would be valuable. While future work, even a brief overview of potential future improvements in this area (e.g. homomorphic encryption libraries designed for federated learning) would be beneficial.
*   **Clarity in Theorem Application:** Although the mathematical derivations are generally sound, the practical implications of Theorems 4 and 5 could be explained more clearly for readers less familiar with kernel methods. How are these asymptotic distributions actually used in the algorithm, and what are the limitations of using these distributions in finite sample settings?
*   **Limited Comparison in Real-world Experiments:** The real world data set has a known ground truth direction that it would be useful to see compared to the directions the models came up with.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand on Communication Cost Analysis:** Provide more guidance on when the summary statistics approach leads to significant communication cost reductions.
*   **Emphasize Horizontal Partitioning Limitation:** Highlight the restriction to horizontally-partitioned data more prominently.
*   **Discuss Privacy-Computation Trade-offs:** Include a brief discussion of the trade-offs between privacy and computational cost when using secure computation techniques.
*   **Clarify Theorem Application in Algorithm:** Improve the explanation of how the asymptotic distributions in Theorems 4 and 5 are used in practice.
*   **Minor Edits:** There are a few minor typographical errors ("extendes" in Section 1) that should be corrected.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of federated causal discovery. The proposed FedCDH method is innovative, well-validated, and addresses important limitations of existing approaches. While some weaknesses exist, the strengths of the paper outweigh the limitations. This paper is worthy of publication at ICLR.
