OUTPUT:
Following Solis et al. (2020), this paper presents a theoretical and empirical study of neural contextual bandits (NeuCBs) using online neural regression. The authors identify key limitations in existing NeuCB algorithms, namely restrictive assumptions on context distribution (i.i.d.) and/or sub-optimal regret bounds stemming from a naive application of online regression results for wide networks.

The paper's key contributions are fourfold: (1) It establishes Ω(T) lower bounds for NeuralUCB and NeuralTS, demonstrating their potential for linear regret in worst-case scenarios. (2) It develops an O(log T) regret bound for online regression under almost convexity, the Quadratic Growth (QG) condition, and unique minima assumptions. (3) Crucially, it overcomes the unique minima limitation of standard wide networks by introducing a small, random perturbation to network predictions. This perturbation enables the application of the QG regret bound, resulting in ˜O(√KT) and ˜O(√(L^*K) + K) regret bounds for NeuCBs with squared loss (NeuSquareCB) and KL loss (NeuFastCB), respectively. (4) The paper presents experimental results on a range of datasets, showing that NeuFastCB consistently outperforms existing NeuCB algorithms, especially in adversarial context selection settings.

The theoretical analysis is well-structured and clearly presented. The proof sketches in the main paper provide a good overview of the technical approach, and the full proofs in the appendix are thorough and detailed. The connection to prior work on online regression and neural network optimization is well-established. The use of the QG condition, combined with a novel perturbation technique to ensure unique minima, represents a significant theoretical advance. The experiments are well-designed to highlight the advantages of the proposed algorithms in challenging scenarios. The use of adversarial context selection addresses a critical limitation of existing NeuCB algorithms.

However, the paper could be improved in the following ways:

*   **Clarity on practical impact of perturbation:** While the perturbation is crucial for the theoretical guarantees, a more in-depth discussion of its practical implications would be valuable. For instance, how sensitive is the performance to the choice of the perturbation constant? The empirical analysis showing impact of perturbation constant on regret are useful, but could be further elaborated upon. Is it possible to learn the perturbation magnitude adaptively?
*   **Comparison with Linear Bandits:**  While the paper mentions the limitations of linear bandits, a direct comparison to well-tuned linear bandit algorithms like LinUCB or Thompson Sampling (especially in low-dimensional context spaces) would strengthen the empirical evaluation.
*   **Computational Cost:**  A more detailed discussion of the computational complexity of NeuSquareCB and NeuFastCB compared to existing algorithms would be beneficial. Are the improvements in regret bounds achieved at the expense of increased computational cost?
*   **More intuitive explanation of why/how the perturbation works:** Could there be an intuitive explanation of how does the random perturbation helps in achieving QG with unique minima?

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes significant contributions to the field of neural contextual bandits. The theoretical analysis is sound, the empirical evaluation is compelling, and the paper addresses key limitations of existing approaches. The proposed algorithms offer improved regret bounds and robustness to adversarial context selection, making them a valuable addition to the NeuCB literature.
