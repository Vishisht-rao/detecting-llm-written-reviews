OUTPUT:
Following Beeson et al. (2020), this paper tackles an important and timely problem: how Large Language Models (LLMs) handle knowledge conflicts, situations where their internal "parametric" knowledge clashes with external "non-parametric" information provided in the prompt. The authors identify three key desiderata for LLMs in such situations: conflict identification, conflicting segment pinpointing, and providing distinct answers reflecting both knowledge sources. To evaluate LLMs against these desiderata, they introduce the KNOWLEDGE CONFLICT framework, a novel benchmark designed to simulate and quantitatively assess performance in knowledge conflict scenarios. The paper presents extensive experiments using this framework, revealing that while LLMs are relatively good at identifying the presence of conflicts, they struggle to pinpoint the specific conflicting information and generate distinct answers reflecting the conflicting knowledge. The authors propose instruction-based approaches to address these challenges, demonstrating some success in improving LLMs' performance. Finally, they provide a factor analysis, highlighting the impact of knowledge domain and prompt text on LLM behavior.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Importance:** The paper addresses a critical issue in the age of LLMs: managing knowledge conflicts. The problem is well-motivated, and the authors clearly articulate the potential pitfalls of LLMs blindly relying on either internal or external knowledge.
*   **Clearly Defined Desiderata:** Defining the three desiderata (identification, pinpointing, distinct answers) provides a solid framework for evaluating LLM behavior in knowledge conflict scenarios.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation Framework:** The KNOWLEDGE CONFLICT framework is a significant contribution. The generation process, involving entity lists, parametric knowledge elicitation, and conflict creation methods (entity substitution and shuffling), is well-explained and seems reasonable. The three tasks (Contextual Knowledge Conflict Detection, QA-Span Knowledge Conflict Detection, and Distinct Answers Generation) are well-designed and cover different aspects of the problem.
*   **Extensive Experiments:** The paper presents a thorough experimental evaluation, covering various prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, CoT, GKP, Self-ask, Break-down, Self-Consistency) and analyzing factors like knowledge domain and prompt variations. The use of ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-TURBO) as the primary LLM is justified, and the inclusion of GPT-4 results provides valuable insights.
*   **Proposed Solutions:** The instruction-based approaches proposed to improve LLM performance are a logical next step, and the results demonstrate some improvement.
*   **Detailed Analysis:** The factor analysis provides valuable insights into the nuances of LLM behavior in knowledge conflict situations. The observation that performance varies across knowledge domains and conflict generation methods is particularly interesting.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors provide detailed descriptions of their methods and experimental settings, including prompt text in the appendix, which greatly aids reproducibility.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Synthetic Data:** The KNOWLEDGE CONFLICT framework relies on synthetic knowledge conflicts. While this allows for controlled experimentation, it raises questions about the generalizability of the findings to real-world scenarios where knowledge conflicts are likely to be more complex and nuanced. The authors acknowledge this limitation but could benefit from further discussion on potential differences and future work to address real-world conflicts.
*   **Limited Success in Task 2:** The instruction-based approach did not outperform baselines in Task 2 (QA-Span Knowledge Conflict Detection). This is a significant challenge, as pinpointing conflicting information is crucial. The authors should discuss potential reasons for this lack of improvement in more detail and suggest alternative approaches for future research.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** While Precision, Recall, and F1-score are standard metrics for classification tasks, the evaluation of Task 3 (Distinct Answers Generation) relies solely on accuracy. A more nuanced evaluation metric that considers the quality and relevance of the generated answers would be beneficial. Metrics like BLEU or ROUGE might not be directly applicable but adaptations or other text similarity measures could provide a richer assessment.
*   **Clarity on "Ours" Method:** While the prompts in the appendix are helpful, the "Ours" method descriptions in the main text are somewhat vague.  More detailed explanations of the rationale behind each step in the proposed instruction-based approaches would improve understanding and allow readers to appreciate the method's strengths and limitations more clearly. For example, clarifying why sentence-level analysis is expected to help in conflict resolution.
*   **Ethics Discussion:** The ethics statement is rather high-level. A more in-depth discussion about the potential biases embedded in the training data and how these biases might influence LLMs' handling of knowledge conflicts would strengthen the paper. Specifically, how might the models decide which knowledge to trust?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Real-world Data:** Explore methods for incorporating real-world knowledge conflicts into the evaluation framework. This could involve curating a dataset of conflicting information from sources like news articles, Wikipedia edit histories, or expert debates.
*   **Task 2 Analysis:** Conduct a more detailed error analysis of Task 2 to understand why the instruction-based approach failed to improve performance. Are there specific types of questions or conflicts that are particularly difficult to pinpoint?
*   **Evaluation Metric for Task 3:** Consider using a more nuanced evaluation metric for Task 3 that goes beyond simple accuracy.
*   **Clarity on "Ours" Method:** Provide more detailed explanations of the proposed instruction-based approaches.
*   **Broader Ethics Discussion:** Expand the ethics discussion to address potential biases in training data and their impact on LLM behavior.
*   **Consider Multi-Hop Reasoning More Explicitly:** While addressed in the Appendix, the mention of multi-hop questions could be integrated into the main text, as it represents a realistic and challenging scenario. Discuss how the KNOWLEDGE CONFLICT framework could be extended to evaluate LLMs' ability to handle knowledge conflicts in multi-hop reasoning tasks.

**Overall:**

This is a well-written and valuable paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of LLMs. The KNOWLEDGE CONFLICT framework provides a much-needed tool for evaluating LLM behavior in knowledge conflict scenarios. While the paper has some limitations, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, and the authors provide a clear roadmap for future research. I recommend acceptance, contingent on addressing the suggestions for improvement.
