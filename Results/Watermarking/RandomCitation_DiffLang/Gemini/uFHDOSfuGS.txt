OUTPUT:
Following Lamontagne et al. (2022), this paper tackles an important problem in the field of explainable AI: the robustness of counterfactual explanations to model changes. The authors propose a novel entropic risk measure to quantify the robustness of counterfactuals and demonstrate its connection to both worst-case robust (min-max optimization) and robustness-constrained approaches. The paper is well-motivated, clearly written, and offers both theoretical contributions and practical algorithmic considerations. Here's a breakdown of the review:

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The core idea of using entropic risk as a robustness measure for counterfactuals is novel and promising. It provides a unifying framework for existing robustness approaches.
*   **Theoretical Foundation:** The paper is grounded in solid theoretical foundations, drawing from large deviation theory, mathematical finance, and risk-sensitive control. The connection to min-max optimization through Theorem 1 is particularly significant.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The motivation and problem statement are clearly articulated. The preliminaries section effectively sets the stage for the technical contributions.
*   **Algorithmic Contribution:** The paper doesn't just present theory; it also proposes a practical, relaxed estimator for the entropic risk measure that can be used in an optimization algorithm (P4/P5). The discussion of its properties and connection to existing algorithms like T-Rex is valuable.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The experiments, while perhaps not extensive, are sufficient to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed method. The use of a synthetic 2D dataset helps to visualize the behavior of the algorithm. The comparisons with existing methods (ROAR and SNS) are relevant.
*   **Reproducibility Statement:** The inclusion of a reproducibility statement is commendable.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Novelty in Algorithm:** While the entropic risk measure is novel, the algorithmic strategy leveraging it (Entropic T-Rex) relies heavily on existing techniques like T-Rex. The contribution is primarily in *how* the risk is measured and incorporated, not in developing a fundamentally new optimization procedure. This should be acknowledged more explicitly.
*   **Strong Assumptions for Theorem 2:** Theorem 2 relies on rather strong assumptions, particularly the MGF-equivalence class and the Lipschitz continuity of the models. The paper mentions relaxing the MGF assumptions would require more intricate proofs, but a brief discussion of the limitations imposed by these assumptions would be helpful. A larger Lipschitz constant reduces the effectiveness of their guarentee (as the probability will approach zero).
*   **Experimental Scope:** The experimental evaluation could be more comprehensive. While the included datasets are relevant, exploring a wider range of datasets and model architectures would strengthen the empirical validation. A more detailed hyperparameter sensitivity analysis could also be beneficial. The effect of k, for example is not addressed.
*   **Computational Complexity:** The reliance on sampling and gradient estimation for the relaxed risk measure can be computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional datasets. The paper acknowledges this in the limitations section, but a more detailed discussion of the computational complexity and potential scalability issues would be valuable. More detail on how the authors choose the standard deviation for their Gaussian distribution for sampling would also be appreciated.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Clarify Algorithmic Novelty:** Explicitly state that the algorithmic contribution lies primarily in *how* the entropic risk measure is integrated into the optimization process, rather than in developing a completely new algorithm from scratch.
*   **Discuss Limitations of Theorem 2's Assumptions:** Expand on the limitations imposed by the MGF-equivalence and Lipschitz continuity assumptions. Discuss how these assumptions might restrict the applicability of the method.
*   **Expand Experimental Evaluation:** Include experiments on a wider range of datasets and model architectures. Perform a more thorough hyperparameter sensitivity analysis.
*   **Address Computational Complexity:** Provide a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method, particularly the impact of sampling and gradient estimation. Discuss potential strategies for improving scalability. The authors could discuss alternative approaches to evaluating their measure.
*   **Typographical Errors:** Throughout the document, there are instances where typographical errors are present which could be improved prior to publication.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Despite the weaknesses mentioned above, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of explainable AI. The proposed entropic risk measure is a novel and theoretically sound approach to quantifying the robustness of counterfactual explanations. The connection to existing robustness methods and the practical algorithm make this a promising work. I recommend accepting the paper, conditional on addressing the suggested improvements. I believe the paper should be reviewed by individuals familiar with Explainable AI and Robust Optimization. The review committee should focus on the soundness of their statistical and algorithmic claims.
