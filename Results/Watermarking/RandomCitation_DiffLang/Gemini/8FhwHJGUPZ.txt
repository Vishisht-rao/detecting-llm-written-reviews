OUTPUT:
Following Freeze et al. (2017), this paper presents a Dual-Balancing Multi-Task Learning (DB-MTL) method to address the task balancing problem in multi-task learning. The core idea is to balance both loss scales and gradient magnitudes across different tasks. The authors propose a logarithm transformation for loss-scale balancing and a gradient normalization technique that scales all task gradients to the magnitude of the maximum gradient norm. The paper claims state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Relevance:** The task balancing problem in MTL is a well-known and important challenge, and this paper tackles it directly.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and explains the proposed DB-MTL method clearly. The motivation behind the dual-balancing approach is well articulated. The algorithm is presented in a step-by-step manner, making it easy to understand.
*   **Simplicity:** The proposed method is relatively simple to implement, involving a logarithm transformation and gradient normalization. This simplicity is a strength, potentially making it easier to adopt and integrate into existing MTL frameworks.
*   **Empirical Evaluation:** The paper presents a comprehensive set of experiments across multiple benchmark datasets and tasks, including scene understanding, image classification, and molecular property prediction. The comparison with a wide range of existing MTL methods strengthens the claims of state-of-the-art performance.
*   **Ablation Study:** The ablation study provides valuable insights into the contribution of each component (loss-scale balancing and gradient-magnitude balancing) to the overall performance of DB-MTL.
*   **Useful Insights:** The insight that loss scale can affect gradient balancing methods and that DB-MTL converges faster than EW because of balancing on both loss and gradient levels is valuable.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Novelty:** While the combination of loss-scale balancing via logarithm transformation and gradient-magnitude balancing is presented as novel, logarithm transformation for individual task loss is not new. The paper should explicitly mention it. The normalization of gradients is also a known approach. The novelty primarily lies in the specific combination and choice of maximum gradient norm. The claims of novelty should be carefully checked and revised if necessary.
*   **Justification for Maximum Gradient Norm:** While Figure 4 provides empirical evidence for using the maximum gradient norm for scaling, a more theoretical or intuitive justification would be beneficial. Why does normalizing to the maximum norm consistently outperform other strategies?
*   **Computational Cost:** The paper admits that DB-MTL has higher per-epoch running time as each taskâ€™s gradient is computed in every iteration. More details and analysis of the computational complexity compared to other approaches would be useful. Specifically, an analysis of the scalability of DB-MTL to a large number of tasks is missing.
*   **Discussion of Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The paper mentions a grid search for beta. A more detailed discussion of the sensitivity of DB-MTL to the choice of hyperparameters would be valuable. The range that works well, and some guidelines on setting these parameters could enhance the practical usability of the method.
*   **Missing Reference:** In the discussion with Auxiliary Learning the paper mentions Du et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2022; Navon et al., 2021. However, the reference Du et al., 2019 (Adapting auxiliary losses using gradient similarity) is duplicated in the reference list and Navon et al., 2021 (Auxiliary learning by implicit differentiation) has already been cited in the earlier sections.
*   **Limited Scope:** The paper admits that it is challenging to apply DB-MTL to auxiliary learning directly. Why? More details and analysis of the differences between multi-task learning and auxiliary learning would be useful.
*   **Reference issue:** There is inconsistency in writing the reference section. Chen et al., 2018a is an example. "Chen, Vijay Badrinarayanan, Chen-Yu Lee, and Andrew Rabinovich. GradNorm: Gradient normalization for adaptive loss balancing in deep multitask networks." is not correct.
*   **Typos:** There are minor typos throughout the paper (e.g., "tunning" instead of "tuning"). Careful proofreading is necessary.

**Overall:**

DB-MTL presents a relatively simple and effective approach to the task balancing problem in MTL. The extensive experimental results demonstrate its potential to achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, the paper could be strengthened by addressing the weaknesses listed above, particularly regarding novelty, justification of the maximum gradient norm strategy, and computational cost.
