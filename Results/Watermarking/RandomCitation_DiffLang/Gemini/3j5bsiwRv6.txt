OUTPUT:
Following Barnhill et al. (2021), this paper introduces SparseRefine, a novel approach to efficient high-resolution semantic segmentation. The core idea revolves around refining dense low-resolution predictions with sparse high-resolution information, aiming to reduce computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. This is achieved through three main components: an entropy selector identifying uncertain pixels, a sparse feature extractor generating refinements for these pixels, and a gated ensembler fusing the initial predictions with the refinements. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of SparseRefine on various semantic segmentation models (HRNet, SegFormer, Mask2Former, SegNeXt) and datasets (Cityscapes, BDD100K, DeepGlobe, ISIC).

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The "dense+sparse" paradigm for semantic segmentation is a compelling idea that addresses the computational challenges of high-resolution imagery effectively. The combination of entropy-based pixel selection, sparse convolutions, and gated ensembling seems well-motivated.
*   **Efficiency:** The reported speedups (1.5x to 3.9x) are significant and would be of considerable interest to the ICLR audience, especially for applications with latency constraints.
*   **Generalizability:** The paper convincingly demonstrates that SparseRefine can be integrated with different CNN- and Transformer-based architectures. The results on multiple datasets strengthen the claim of generalizability.
*   **Comprehensive Experiments:** The experimental section is well-designed, with clear baselines, ablation studies, and comparisons to relevant methods like SparseViT and PointRend. The inclusion of qualitative results provides further insight.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, with a clear explanation of the proposed method and its components. The figures are helpful in visualizing the overall architecture and key concepts.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors promise to release the code, which is critical for reproducibility and further research.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Novelty of Individual Components:** While the overall approach is novel, the individual components (entropy selection, sparse convolutions, gated ensembling) are relatively well-established. The paper could benefit from further emphasizing the specific adaptations and combinations that make SparseRefine unique. It would be benificial to do some theoretical work for the performance improvement that can be obtained with the proposed approach.
*   **Parameter Sensitivity:** The entropy threshold (Î±) is a crucial hyperparameter. While Table 5b explores its impact, the paper could discuss more about how to choose the optimal value for different models and datasets. Providing some guidelines for setting this parameter would be helpful.
*   **Scalability:** The largest model tested is SegNeXt-L. While impressive, it is worth discussing the potential scalability challenges of SparseRefine with even larger models or significantly higher resolutions. Is there a point where the overhead of sparse refinement outweighs the benefits?
*   **Minor Presentation Issues:**
    *   Figure 3's axes labels could be larger and clearer.
    *   Table 1 could benefit from explicitly stating the speedup achieved by SparseRefine compared to the full-resolution baseline, as well as the mIoU difference to the low-resolution counterpart.
    *   The appendix is referenced frequently, but not included. Including the appendix is crucial for completeness, especially concerning implementation details.

**Questions for the Authors:**

*   How does SparseRefine handle edge cases or situations where the initial low-resolution prediction is severely incorrect?
*   Can you provide more intuition on why adding additional information from the low-resolution inference as input to the sparse feature extractor did not improve performance?
*   What are the limitations of the gated ensembler, and are there alternative fusion mechanisms you considered?
*   How does the performance of SparseRefine vary with different sparsity levels or densities of selected pixels?
*   What are the memory requirements of SparseRefine, especially considering the need to store both low-resolution and high-resolution features?
*   What are the runtimes for training the "Sparse Feature Extractor" component?

**Overall Recommendation:**

This is a strong paper with a promising approach to efficient high-resolution semantic segmentation. The significant speedups achieved without sacrificing accuracy make it a valuable contribution to the field. I recommend **Acceptance** contingent on addressing the minor weaknesses and providing clarification on the questions raised above. The release of the code is also essential.
