OUTPUT:
Following Couture et al. (2017), this paper introduces ∆-SGD, a novel client-side optimization strategy for federated learning (FL) designed to address the challenges of hyperparameter tuning in heterogeneous environments. The core idea is to allow each client to adapt its step size based on the local smoothness of its individual loss function. This is achieved via a simple step size rule that dynamically adjusts to the local characteristics of the data.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Relevance:** The paper tackles a significant challenge in FL: the sensitivity of client-side SGD to step size, particularly under data heterogeneity. The motivation is clear and well-supported by empirical evidence presented in Figure 1, which effectively illustrates the limitations of using a single, globally tuned step size across different clients and tasks.
*   **Novelty:** The proposed ∆-SGD algorithm offers a promising approach to client-side adaptivity in FL. The locality-adaptive step size, which accounts for the local smoothness, is a valuable contribution. The idea of allowing step sizes to potentially increase during local iterations is interesting and could contribute to faster convergence.
*   **Theoretical Analysis:** The paper provides a convergence analysis of ∆-SGD in both general nonconvex and convex settings, which is crucial for establishing the theoretical properties of the proposed method. Assumption 1, while not completely standard, provides a basis for analyzing the client-dependent step size scenario. While somewhat standard, the convergence analysis provides a good foundation for the algorithm.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The experimental evaluation is thorough, covering a range of benchmark datasets (MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, DBpedia, AGnews) and model architectures (CNN, ResNet, DistillBERT). The comparison against various baseline methods (SGD, SGDM, Adam, Adagrad, SPS) is comprehensive. Showing results across image and text is great. The experiments highlight the robustness of ∆-SGD across different datasets, model architectures, and levels of heterogeneity.
*   **Clarity of Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it relatively easy to follow the proposed method and its theoretical analysis. The algorithm description (Algorithm 1) is clear and concise. The additional experimental results in the Appendix are helpful for gaining a deeper understanding of the algorithm's behavior.
* **Versatility:** The ability to combine the proposed method with FedAdam, FedProx, and MOON loss functions is a huge strength that indicates the potential for ∆-SGD to become a widely used approach.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Assumption 1(c) and Strong Growth:** Assumption 1(c) concerning the "strong growth of dissimilarity" between individual client loss functions and the global loss is a bit strong. While the paper acknowledges its similarity to the strong growth condition in stochastic optimization, it would benefit from further justification for its applicability in the FL context. Moreover, there's some redundancy since assumption 1(b) already sets a hard limit to the gradient. Assumption 1(c) could be potentially relaxed.
*   **Practical Significance of Theorem 1:** The condition γ=O(1
K√
T) and η0=O(γ) might limit the practical applicability of the theoretical results. While the paper mentions that these conditions are only required for the theory, it would be beneficial to discuss potential ways to relax these conditions or provide insights into their impact on the algorithm's performance in practice. It might be interesting to show empirically how these parameters impact the convergence.
*   **Experimental Details:** While the experimental setup is well-described, some details could be further clarified. For example, specifying the exact range of learning rates used in the grid search for each optimizer would be helpful. It also would be stronger to have the results of multiple seeds as opposed to relying on single-run experiments.
* **SPS Baseline Discussion:** The inconsistent performance of the Stochastic Polyak Stepsize (SPS) method across different tasks warrants further discussion. The paper notes that SPS performs suboptimally in several cases, but doesn't delve into the potential reasons for this behavior beyond mentioning the impact of improper f(x⋆) estimation. Deeper analysis on SPS would make the paper stronger.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Justification of Assumption 1(c):** Provide a more detailed explanation of why Assumption 1(c) is reasonable in the FL setting. Consider discussing scenarios where this assumption might be violated and the potential consequences for the algorithm's performance.
*   **Discussion of Theoretical Conditions:** Elaborate on the implications of the conditions on γ and η0 in Theorem 1. Discuss potential strategies for relaxing these conditions in future work.
*   **Detailed Learning Rate Ranges:** Include a table specifying the exact range of learning rates used in the grid search for each optimizer and each experiment.
*   **More robust reporting (Multiple Seeds):** It would be stronger to have the results of multiple seeds as opposed to relying on single-run experiments.
*   **Analysis of SPS Performance:** Investigate the reasons for the inconsistent performance of SPS in the experiments. Consider analyzing the sensitivity of SPS to the choice of parameters, especially in light of data heterogeneity.

**Overall Recommendation:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of federated learning. The proposed ∆-SGD algorithm is a novel and effective approach to client-side optimization in heterogeneous environments. The theoretical analysis and comprehensive experimental results provide solid evidence of the algorithm's effectiveness. While the paper has some minor weaknesses, its strengths outweigh its limitations. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the points mentioned above.
