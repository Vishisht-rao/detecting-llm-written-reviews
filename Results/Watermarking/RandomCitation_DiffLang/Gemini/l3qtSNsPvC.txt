OUTPUT:
Following Bonanno et al. (2015), this paper introduces a signal sampling theory for graphons, aiming to address scalability issues in large-scale graph machine learning. The core idea is to perform sampling on the graphon limit, thereby obtaining uniqueness sets that generalize to finite graphs converging to the graphon.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The paper presents a novel approach to graph sampling by leveraging graphon limits, offering a potential solution to the limitations of existing methods that require expensive spectral computations and are sensitive to graph changes.
*   **Theoretical contributions:** The paper provides theoretical guarantees, including a Poincar´e inequality for graphons and consistency results for sampling sets. The connection between graphon sampling and kernel spectral clustering is also a valuable insight.
*   **Comprehensive Approach:** The authors explore two distinct approaches to the problem, with the second having a more direct relationship to practical algorithms. The theoretical claims are generally clear and supported by relevant citations.
*   **Empirical validation:** The paper demonstrates the empirical performance of the proposed algorithm on graph machine learning tasks, including GNN training with subsampled graphs and accelerating positional encoding computation. The experiments, while limited in scope, provide initial evidence of the method's effectiveness.
*   **Well-structured and clearly written:** The paper is generally well-organized and easy to follow. The introduction clearly outlines the problem, motivation, and contributions, and the related work section provides a good overview of the existing literature.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Technical Complexity:** The paper involves advanced mathematical concepts (graphons, spectral theory, functional analysis), which may limit its accessibility to a broader audience. While the authors provide some background, a more detailed explanation of certain concepts might be helpful. The appendix helps, but there is still a significant cognitive load.
*   **Limited Empirical Evaluation:** The empirical evaluation is limited to a few datasets and tasks. More extensive experiments on diverse graphs and machine learning problems are needed to fully assess the practical applicability and limitations of the proposed algorithm. The number of realizations for each experiment is rather small, impacting the statistical significance of the results.
*   **Parameter Sensitivity:** The experimental results suggest that the performance of the proposed algorithm is sensitive to parameter choices (e.g., cutoff frequency, number of communities). A more thorough analysis of parameter sensitivity and guidelines for parameter selection would be beneficial. The paper acknowledges the impact of sample size but does not fully explore it.
*   **Algorithm Heuristic Nature:** While theoretically grounded, the Gaussian elimination method is known to be sensitive to pivoting and numerical instability. The convergence in probability results may not be enough to ensure good sampling sets in all experiments.
*   **Clarity regarding novelties w.r.t concurrent work:** The relationship to the concurrent work by Parada-Mayorga & Ribeiro (2024) is not fully clarified. The paper highlights differences in the analysis (consistency of sampling vs. Poincar´e constant convergence), but a more detailed comparison of the results and contributions would be valuable.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Provide more intuitive explanations of key concepts:** Consider adding more visual aids or examples to illustrate the main ideas, especially for readers who are not experts in graphon theory.
*   **Conduct more extensive experiments:** Evaluate the proposed algorithm on a wider range of datasets and tasks, and compare its performance against other graph sampling methods. Include a larger number of realizations to improve statistical significance.
*   **Analyze parameter sensitivity more thoroughly:** Investigate the impact of different parameter choices on the algorithm's performance and provide guidelines for parameter selection.
*   **Address the limitations of Gaussian elimination:** Discuss potential issues with numerical stability and explore alternative sampling strategies that may be more robust.
*   **Clarify the relationship to concurrent work:** Provide a more detailed comparison of the results and contributions of this paper and the work by Parada-Mayorga & Ribeiro (2024).

**Overall:**

The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of graph sampling by introducing a novel approach based on graphon limits. The theoretical results are well-founded, and the empirical validation provides initial evidence of the algorithm's effectiveness. Despite some limitations, the paper is a valuable addition to the literature and has the potential to inspire further research in this area. With some improvements, particularly in the empirical evaluation and clarity of presentation, the paper could be even more impactful.
