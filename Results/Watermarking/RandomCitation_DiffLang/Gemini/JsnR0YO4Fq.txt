OUTPUT:
Following Sharp et al. (2016), this paper explores the effectiveness of weight balancing (WB) for long-tailed recognition (LTR) problems. The authors dissect WB into its constituent components (weight decay, MaxNorm, cross-entropy, class-balanced loss, and two-stage learning) and analyze their impact on neural collapse and the cone effect. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, they demonstrate that WB's first stage improves feature discrimination (FDR) through weight decay and cross-entropy, while the second stage performs implicit logit adjustment using weight decay and class-balanced loss. Importantly, they propose a simplified, single-stage training method that achieves higher accuracy than WB.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Problem Definition:** The paper clearly articulates the long-tailed recognition problem and the motivation for understanding WB.
*   **Thorough Analysis:** The dissection of WB into its components and the subsequent analysis of each component's effect is a strong point. The paper goes beyond simply reporting performance numbers and seeks to understand the underlying mechanisms.
*   **Theoretical Justification:** The theoretical analysis (Theorems 1 and 2) provides a valuable framework for understanding the empirical observations. The connection to neural collapse and the cone effect is insightful.
*   **Simplified Method:** The proposed simplification, achieving improved accuracy with a single-stage training method, is a significant contribution. It offers a practical and efficient alternative to WB.
*   **Comprehensive Experiments:** The experiments cover several datasets (CIFAR10/100, mini-ImageNet, ImageNet, Helena) and architectures (ResNet, ResNeXt, MLP, ResBlock), demonstrating the generalizability of the findings. The ablation studies effectively isolate the impact of different components.
*   **Well-written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and logically organized, making it relatively easy to follow the arguments and results. The inclusion of an appendix with detailed settings and additional experiments is appreciated.
*   **Code Availability:** The code availability enhances the reproducibility of the study.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Theorem 1 Assumptions:** The assumptions of Theorem 1, particularly concerning the ETF weight matrix and bounded feature norms, should be discussed more thoroughly. How restrictive are these assumptions in practice? Are there situations where they are unlikely to hold, and what would be the consequences for the theorem's conclusions?
*   **MaxNorm Justification in Appendix:** The statement that MaxNorm only changes initial values needs stronger justification. Although the Appendix A.5 is mentioned, more detail within the main text about why MaxNorm is not intrinsically constraining the optimization would strengthen the argument.
*   **Limited Model Types:** The conclusion mentions a limitation regarding the model types. Explicitly stating the hypothesis, or a direction of how the analysis might differ for transformers (ViT) might improve the impact.
*   **Helena Dataset Details:** More details on the data preprocessing and class balancing strategy (if any) used for the Helena dataset would be beneficial. Also, clarifying how the FDR is computed for tabular data could also be useful.
*   **Presentation of Results:** While generally well-presented, some tables and figures could be improved. For example, including error bars in Table 1 would provide a better sense of the statistical significance of the FDR differences. The labeling of the x-axis in Figure 2 could be more informative.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Elaborate on Theorem 1's assumptions and limitations.** Discuss the potential impact on the cone effect mitigation.
*   **Provide more context for the claim about MaxNorm's effect.** Quantify the changes.
*   **Briefly comment how this work relates to methods using contrastive learning**, given its recent popularity in LTR.
*   **Strengthen the discussion on the broader implications** of the findings, perhaps focusing on computational efficiency and resource savings. Quantify these.
*   **Improve the presentation of some results** by adding error bars, clarifying axis labels, and providing more detail on the Helena dataset.

**Overall:**

This is a well-researched and well-written paper that makes a significant contribution to the understanding of weight balancing for long-tailed recognition. The theoretical analysis, empirical evaluation, and proposed simplification are all valuable. Addressing the minor weaknesses mentioned above would further strengthen the paper. The paper is suitable for publication at ICLR.
