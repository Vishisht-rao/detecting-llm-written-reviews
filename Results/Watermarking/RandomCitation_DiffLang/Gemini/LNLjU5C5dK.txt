OUTPUT:
Following Federico et al. (2020), this paper presents FIGA, a novel approach to aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences by leveraging fine-grained quality signals. The core idea revolves around contrasting a low-quality initial LLM response with a corresponding high-quality, revised version. The authors hypothesize that explicitly showing the model *what* changes improve the response will lead to better alignment than simply imitating a high-quality response, as in standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT). This is achieved through a curated dataset, SPA, which contains triplets of (query, initial response, revised response) and a modified loss function that assigns token-level weights based on whether a token was added, deleted, or substituted during the revision process.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The core idea of leveraging fine-grained quality signals derived from contrasting "bad" and "good" responses is innovative and addresses a key limitation of traditional SFT approaches that treat all tokens in a target sequence equally.
*   **SPA Dataset:** The creation of the SPA dataset is a significant contribution. The focus on queries where the initial LLM performs poorly and the revision of those initial responses by ChatGPT to create targets that are closer in distribution to the base LLM's output are both sound strategies. The paper clearly outlines the data creation process, including the reasoning behind the filtering and revision steps.
*   **Clear Methodology:** The paper clearly explains the FIGA approach, the construction of the SPA dataset, and the fine-grained weighting scheme in the loss function. Algorithm 1 provides a good overview of the entire process.
*   **Strong Experimental Results:** The experiments demonstrate that FIGA outperforms several strong baselines, including SFT and PPO, on a variety of benchmarks. The ablation studies analyzing the contributions of different components of the SPA dataset and weighting functions provide valuable insights. The win rates against other baselines on Vicuna and WizardLM are convincing.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the authors' reasoning and methodology.
*   **Open-Source Resource:** The release of the resources at the provided GitHub link is commendable and facilitates reproducibility.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Reliance on ChatGPT for Revisions:** While using ChatGPT for revisions helps bridge the distribution gap, it also introduces a dependency on a closed-source LLM. Further exploration of alternative methods for generating revised responses could strengthen the approach.  Specifically, more analysis of the prompts is needed.  How sensitive is the performance to the specific phrasing?
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The hyperparameter settings (α, β, γ) are mentioned, but the justification for these specific values could be stronger. While Appendix E explores some hyperparameter variants, a more thorough sensitivity analysis might be beneficial.  It isn't clear how the chosen values were optimized, or if more sophisticated optimization techniques were employed.
*   **Fine-grained negative log-likelihood threshold**: The choice of 0.6 as threshold to filter bad tokens with a negative log-likelihood could use more explanation. It seems like an important parameter that influences which tokens get penalized.
*   **Human Evaluation Limited:** While human evaluation is performed and mentioned in Appendix F, the scale is rather limited (20 instructions and 30 instructions for different experiments) and could be expanded for more robust and statistically significant results. The use of mode method to aggregate the results from human evaluators also needs justification.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Elaborate on ChatGPT Prompting:** Provide more details about the specific prompts used for ChatGPT revision generation. This would allow for better reproducibility and a deeper understanding of the method. Could the prompts be provided in the appendix?
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Discuss how the hyperparameters (α, β, γ) were chosen. Were they optimized on a validation set? A more detailed exploration of their impact on performance would be valuable.
*   **Expand Human Evaluation:** Conduct a more comprehensive human evaluation with a larger number of instructions and evaluators to increase the statistical significance of the results.
*   **Discuss Limitations Further:** Acknowledge and discuss potential limitations more explicitly. For example, address the computational cost of using ChatGPT for creating the SPA dataset.
*   **Scalability:** While the approach is effective, discuss its potential scalability to larger models and datasets. Would the revision process become a bottleneck?

**Overall:**

This paper presents a strong and novel approach to aligning LLMs with human preferences. The FIGA method, along with the SPA dataset, offers a promising alternative to traditional SFT and RLHF techniques. Despite some weaknesses, the strengths of the paper outweigh the limitations. It's a valuable contribution to the field and warrants acceptance. The provided open-source resources further enhance its impact.
