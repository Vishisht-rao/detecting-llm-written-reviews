OUTPUT:
Following Jessee et al. (2017), this paper introduces AutomaTi kZ, a framework for text-guided synthesis of scientific vector graphics using Ti kZ. The authors propose using Ti kZ as an intermediate, human-readable representation for generating vector graphics from text descriptions, addressing the limitations of directly generating low-level SVG elements. They present DaTi kZ, a large-scale dataset of 120k Ti kZ drawings paired with captions, and fine-tune LLaMA and a novel model, CLiMA (LLaMA augmented with CLIP embeddings), on this dataset. The results, based on both automatic and human evaluations, show that CLiMA and LLaMA outperform commercial GPT-4 and Claude 2 in generating figures similar to human-created ones, with CLiMA also improving text-image alignment. The paper also includes an analysis of memorization and the tendency of GPT-4 and Claude 2 to generate simpler figures. The framework, models, and datasets are made publicly available.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The paper tackles a relevant and challenging problem â€“ the automated generation of scientific vector graphics, which is crucial for research and communication. The use of Ti kZ as an intermediate representation is a clever and practical approach.
*   **Dataset Contribution:** The creation and release of DaTi kZ is a significant contribution to the field, as it provides a large-scale resource for training and evaluating text-to-Ti kZ models.
*   **Model Innovation:** The CLiMA architecture, integrating CLIP embeddings into LLaMA, is a novel and well-motivated approach to improving text-image alignment.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper presents a thorough evaluation, including both automatic metrics (CLIPScore, KID, CrystalBLEU, EED, CSR) and human evaluations (best-worst scaling).  The use of expert annotators strengthens the validity of the human evaluation.
*   **Detailed Analysis:** The analysis of memorization, code/image complexity, and the typographic attacks by GPT-4 is insightful and valuable. The ablation studies effectively demonstrate the contribution of data augmentation and different data sources.
*   **Reproducibility:** The public availability of the framework, models, and datasets promotes reproducibility and further research in this area.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is well-written and clearly structured, making it easy to understand the problem, approach, and results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Exploration of Compiler Feedback:** While the iterative resampling method is a reasonable starting point, it's a relatively simplistic approach to error handling. A deeper integration of compiler feedback into the generation process (e.g., through reinforcement learning or more sophisticated constrained decoding) could potentially lead to significant improvements. The context size limitation hindering multi-turn conversations is a valid constraint, but its impact on exploring more interactive error correction should be acknowledged as a key avenue for future research.
*   **Potential Bias in Human Evaluation:** While expert annotators were used, the potential for subtle biases remains.  Explicitly acknowledging potential biases and further detailing the instructions provided to annotators would further strengthen the human evaluation. Were annotators warned about typographic attacks, for example? This is important context for the interpretation of the results.
*   **Limited Dataset Diversity:** While the dataset is large, the breadth of scientific figures and their corresponding descriptions is finite. Future work should aim to expand the dataset with more diverse and challenging examples. More detailed description on how examples were curated in the curated examples source would also be helpful.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Discuss the Limitations of Ti kZ:** A brief discussion of the limitations of Ti kZ as a representation language (e.g., difficulty in representing certain types of complex visualizations) would provide a more complete picture.
*   **Explore More Sophisticated Error Handling:**  Discuss potential future directions for incorporating compiler feedback into the generation process, such as reinforcement learning or constrained decoding.
*   **Elaborate on the Annotation Process:** Provide more details on the instructions given to the human annotators, including specific examples and a discussion of potential biases.
*   **Address Dataset Bias:** Acknowledge any potential biases in the DaTi kZ dataset and discuss strategies for mitigating them in future work.
*   **Qualitative Examples of CLiMA's Visual Reasoning:** Provide more qualitative examples showcasing CLiMA's ability to leverage CLIP embeddings for visual reasoning, particularly when provided with image inputs. The "conditioning on sketches" potential isn't explored beyond its mention.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and practical approach to generating scientific vector graphics from text. The contributions are significant, the evaluation is thorough, and the analysis is insightful. The paper is well-written and the framework, models, and datasets are publicly available, making it a valuable contribution to the research community. Addressing the relatively minor weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper. I recommend acceptance.
