OUTPUT:
Following Griner et al. (2021), this paper tackles the critical question of the reliability of feature visualizations, a cornerstone of mechanistic interpretability. The authors convincingly argue that feature visualizations, while intuitively appealing, may not be as trustworthy as often assumed. The paper presents a multi-faceted approach, combining adversarial attacks, empirical sanity checks, and theoretical analysis to demonstrate the potential for feature visualizations to be misleading.

**Strengths:**

*   **Important and Timely Topic:** The paper addresses a crucial gap in the interpretability literature. As AI systems become more complex and impactful, ensuring the reliability of interpretability methods is paramount. The focus on feature visualizations, a widely used yet under-validated technique, is particularly valuable.
*   **Multi-Pronged Approach:** The combination of adversarial attacks, empirical sanity checks, and theoretical analysis provides a strong and well-rounded argument. Each perspective reinforces the others, making the overall message highly persuasive.
*   **Adversarial Rigor:** The "fooling circuit" and "silent unit" methods are creative and demonstrate that feature visualizations can be actively manipulated without significantly impacting model performance. This is a powerful demonstration of unreliability.
*   **Empirical Sanity Check:** The proposed sanity check, comparing the processing paths of natural images and feature visualizations, is a novel and insightful approach. The empirical results convincingly show that feature visualizations often deviate significantly from how networks process natural inputs, raising serious concerns about their explanatory power.
*   **Theoretical Foundation:** The theoretical analysis provides a formal framework for understanding the limitations of feature visualizations. The impossibility results, showing that reliable prediction is impossible for a wide range of function classes, are significant and thought-provoking.
*   **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is well-written and clearly presents complex ideas. The figures are informative and effectively illustrate the key findings. The inclusion of a "Reproducibility Statement" and detailed appendices further strengthens the paper.
*   **Discussion of Broader Impacts and Limitations:** The authors thoroughly address the potential societal impacts of their research, as well as its limitations. The honesty and openness to the limitations of the proposed techniques is very welcomed.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Complexity of Fooling Circuits:** While effective, the "fooling circuit" method requires access to the model's internals and the ability to retrain parts of it. The real-world applicability of this attack might be limited in scenarios where the model is a complete black box without a training pipeline. Further discussion of the threat model would be beneficial.
*   **Sanity Check Generalizability:** While the empirical sanity check reveals a significant difference between feature visualizations and natural images, more models/datasets would be welcomed to further test the sanity check. While the ImageNet-V2 and NINCO experiments already help improve the generalizability of the work, additional results on other common models would be welcome.
*   **Linearity Metric is Preliminary:** The linearity experiments section is a great idea. However, linearity alone isn't enough, and other factors might contribute.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand Discussion of Threat Model:** Provide a more detailed discussion of the scenarios where the "fooling circuit" attack is most likely to be successful. Consider discussing potential defenses against these attacks, even if they are only theoretical.
*   **Address Potential Alternative Explanations for Sanity Check Failure:** While the paper argues that the sanity check failure casts doubt on the ability of feature visualizations to explain how neural networks process natural images, consider addressing other potential explanations, such as the limitations of the Inception-V1 architecture.
*   **Connect Theory and Sanity Check:** Explicitly link the theoretical impossibility results to the empirical observations from the sanity check. Discuss how the theory can help guide the development of more reliable feature visualization methods.
*   **Explain the connection between the results on linear units and the theoretical results.**

**Overall:**

This is a high-quality paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of interpretability. The authors raise important questions about the reliability of feature visualizations and provide compelling evidence to support their claims. The paper is well-written, technically sound, and has the potential to stimulate further research in this area. I recommend acceptance.
