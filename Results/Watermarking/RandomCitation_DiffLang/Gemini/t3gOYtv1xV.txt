OUTPUT:
Following Garrard et al. (2019), this paper explores how transformer models implement the carrying over algorithm for integer addition. The work focuses on smaller, interpretable models (1-3 layers) and attempts to extrapolate insights to larger LLMs (Alpaca 7B, Llemma 7B, and Zephyr 7B). The core idea is to decompose addition into four steps: digit addition, identifying sums >= 10, determining carry locations, and adding the carry. The paper then uses ablation, PCA, and attention pattern analysis to pinpoint where these steps are implemented within the transformer architecture.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Problem Definition and Scope:** The paper tackles a well-defined problem: understanding how transformers perform a basic arithmetic operation. Limiting the scope to addition and breaking it down into sub-tasks is a good strategy.
*   **Extensive Experiments and Analysis:** The paper presents a diverse set of experiments, including ablation studies, PCA on residual streams, and analysis of attention patterns. The breadth of these methods lends credence to the findings. The consideration of various hyperparameters and train/test splits is also commendable.
*   **Modular Implementation Hypothesis:** The central hypothesis that the carrying over algorithm is implemented in a modular fashion, with each step allocated to a specific part of the network, is compelling. The paper provides evidence to support this claim, particularly for two-layer encoder-only models.
*   **Interesting Findings on Phase Transitions:** The observation of a novel phase transition in the QK-circuit of one-layer models is a potentially valuable contribution, even if those models don't fully learn addition.
*   **Reproducibility Efforts:** The paper includes a reproducibility statement, provides code on GitHub, and includes detailed model and training details in the appendix. This greatly enhances the value and impact of the work.
*   **Application to LLMs:** While speculative, the attempt to connect findings from smaller models to LLMs is a worthwhile endeavor. Identifying staircase patterns and analyzing residual streams in LLMs provides some suggestive evidence for similar mechanisms at play.
*   **Careful dissection of the MLP layer**: The paper provides a systematic approach to finding the set of neurons responsible for carrying over.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Generalization Results:** While the paper explores length generalization using priming and finetuning, the results feel somewhat preliminary. A deeper dive into *why* priming works and how it affects the internal representations would be beneficial. The generalization from 3 to 6 digits is still a relatively small step.
*   **LLM Analysis Remains Speculative:** The analysis of LLMs is largely based on attention patterns and residual stream analysis. The link to the modular implementation hypothesis is less clear-cut than in the smaller models. Further experiments (e.g., targeted ablations of specific heads in LLMs) could strengthen this connection. The accuracy of Alpaca 7B was quite low; exploring different prompting strategies or using a stronger base model might yield more informative results.
*   **Clarity and Organization in Some Sections:** The paper is densely packed with information. In some sections (e.g., the description of the pentagon structures in the residual stream), the explanations are difficult to follow and would benefit from more visualizations or clearer prose. Some of the acronyms are not immediately defined and requires reading of the entire paper.
*   **Limited Comparison to Other Arithmetic Methods**: While the carrying over algorithm is standard, a discussion of the possibility of alternative learned algorithms and how the model could leverage them would enhance the context.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Elaborate on Length Generalization:** Dedicate more space to exploring the mechanism of length generalization. Provide a more detailed analysis of how priming modifies the internal representations and enables the model to handle longer inputs. Compare this against the finetuned approach in terms of weight drift and internal represetnation change.
*   **Strengthen the LLM Analysis:** Perform more targeted experiments on LLMs to test the modular implementation hypothesis. For example, attempt to ablate heads identified as crucial for carrying in the smaller models and assess the impact on LLM addition accuracy. Alternatively, one could also inspect larger models trained on algorithmic datasets, such as the Llama 2 model from Andreassen et al. (2024) to see if these structures can be found in larger models.
*   **Improve Clarity and Visualizations:** Simplify the presentation of complex findings (e.g., the pentagon structures). Use more diagrams, heatmaps, or other visualizations to illustrate the key concepts. In particular, providing a complete diagram of the architecture would greatly improve the readability of the paper. In particular, showing a high level connection between the layers would help.
*   **Contextualize with Other Work**: Expand the Related Work section to include more discussion of existing research on arithmetic reasoning in neural networks. Address some of the criticisms of transformers in algorithmic reasoning.
*   **More discussion of alternative possible algorithmic implementation**: The authors operate under the assumption that a carry over algorithm is most likely implemented by the model. It would greatly improve the paper to consider other methods and alternative mechanisms that may be implemented in the model.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to our understanding of how transformers perform arithmetic. The modular implementation hypothesis is compelling, and the extensive experimental results provide valuable insights into the internal mechanisms of these models. While the length generalization and LLM analysis could be strengthened, the paper is well-written, technically sound, and includes important reproducibility efforts. I recommend acceptance, contingent on addressing the suggestions for improvement outlined above.
