OUTPUT:
Following Kaufman et al. (2019), this paper presents a novel variance change detection method designed for scenarios with constantly changing means, motivated by the problem of assessing organ viability in transplantation. The core idea is to use a dual control window scheme to improve computational efficiency compared to an existing method (Gao et al., 2019) while maintaining comparable accuracy.  The paper includes simulations and a real-world application to porcine liver temperature data.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Relevance:**  Organ viability assessment is a critical problem in transplantation with direct implications for patient outcomes and organ utilization.  The paper clearly articulates the limitations of current methods and the need for faster and more accurate techniques.
*   **Methodological Innovation:** The dual control window approach is a reasonable and potentially effective way to address the computational bottleneck of scanning the entire data profile.  The rationale behind using one window for mean estimation and another for variance change detection is sound. The incorporation of prior knowledge about the distribution of change points is also a strength.
*   **Empirical Evaluation:**  The simulation studies provide evidence that the proposed method achieves comparable accuracy to Gao19 while significantly reducing computation time.  The application to real porcine liver temperature data further supports the practical relevance of the work. The inclusion of sensitivity analysis and power analysis in the Appendix is a major plus.
*   **Clarity of Writing:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the proposed method and the experimental results.  The algorithm description is sufficiently detailed.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Novelty compared to Gao et al. (2019):** While the paper positions itself as an improvement to Gao et al. (2019), the precise mathematical differences and justifications could be further emphasized. The paper needs to explicitly highlight exactly how each step of Algorithm 1 differs *mathematically* from the Gao et al. method. A table summarizing the algorithmic differences could be very helpful.
*   **Parameter Tuning and Robustness:**  The choice of parameters like *Wα* is based on the "elbow" method in K-means clustering. This is a bit vague and could benefit from a more rigorous justification or a sensitivity analysis of the algorithm's performance with respect to variations in *Wα*. It's important to discuss how these parameters might need to be adjusted for different organ types or experimental setups.  The paper should address the generalizability of the parameter settings and provide guidance on how to choose appropriate values in new applications. The paper does include a sensitivity analysis in the appendix, but more discussion is needed in the main text.
*   **Justification of Normality Assumption:** The paper assumes that the asymptotic distribution of the variance change point is normal.  While this might be a reasonable approximation, it should be explicitly stated, and a brief justification (e.g., citing a relevant theorem or providing empirical evidence from the data) would strengthen the paper. A discussion of what happens if this assumption is violated is warranted.
*   **Convergence Criterion:**  The convergence criterion is based on the maximum absolute difference between residuals.  While simple, it might not be the most robust or efficient criterion.  The paper should briefly discuss alternative convergence criteria and why the chosen criterion was deemed suitable.
*   **Missing Citations:** While the references are generally comprehensive, some recent advances in change point detection, especially those that deal with computational efficiency (e.g., sketching methods, online algorithms with theoretical guarantees) could be included in the introduction. Also, it might be beneficial to cite some papers related to organ viability assessment that are not based on temperature.
*   **Heatmap Limitations:** The paper mentions that the heatmap results are "validated by biomedical scientists," but it does not provide details on the validation process. More information on the specific criteria used by the scientists and the level of agreement would be helpful. The heatmaps are also quite coarse; a discussion of the spatial resolution and its implications for clinical interpretation would be beneficial. Also, could you directly compare the run-times (in seconds) of the Gao method to the dual window method (e.g. 3500 seconds vs 2100 seconds, respectively).

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Explicitly compare the new method to the original Gao method:** the authors need to spell out exactly how the *math* and *algorithms* differ.
*   **Provide more rigorous justification for the parameter choices**, especially *Wα*. Discuss the generalizability of parameter settings.
*   **Justify the normality assumption** of the variance change point distribution.
*   **Discuss alternative convergence criteria.**
*   **Include additional relevant citations** in the introduction, especially regarding computationally efficient change point detection methods.
*   **Provide more details on the validation of the heatmap results** by biomedical scientists.

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of organ viability assessment. The dual control window approach offers a promising avenue for improving the computational efficiency of variance change detection in scenarios with constantly changing means. While some aspects of the paper could be strengthened (as detailed above), the empirical results and the practical relevance of the problem make this a worthwhile contribution. I would recommend acceptance, conditional on addressing the points raised above.
