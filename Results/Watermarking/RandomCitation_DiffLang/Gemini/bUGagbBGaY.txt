OUTPUT:
Following Cabello et al. (2016), this paper introduces a momentum-accelerated diffusion process (FDM) to improve the training and sampling efficiency of diffusion models. The core idea is to draw an analogy between the forward diffusion process in DMs and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on a time-variant stochastic function, and then to incorporate the momentum term from momentum SGD into the diffusion process. The authors address the challenge of deriving the noise perturbation kernel for this modified diffusion process by framing it as a critically damped oscillation system. They claim significant improvements in training and sampling speed for several popular DM frameworks (VP, VE, EDM) on standard datasets.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The idea of applying momentum to the diffusion process from a stochastic optimization perspective is interesting and potentially impactful. The analogy between the diffusion process and SGD is a clever starting point.
*   **Clarity of Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The motivation behind introducing momentum is clear, and the challenges are adequately addressed.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in training and sampling efficiency. Reducing training costs by 50% and sampling steps by 3x are significant achievements if consistently reproducible.
*   **Generalizability:** The paper shows that FDM can be applied to different DM frameworks (VP, VE, EDM), indicating potential broader applicability.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors explicitly address reproducibility by promising code and model checkpoint releases.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Theoretical Justification:** While the connection to SGD is interesting, the theoretical analysis in Section 4.2 and Appendices C and D could be strengthened. Theorem 1 and 2 feels disconnected from the practical implementation in a sense that the assumption of them is hard to guarantee. Showing a rigorous relationship between the derived formula and the practice is still lacking. The connection between the theoretical convergence improvement in optimization and the actual improvement in image quality is not fully established. It should be clearer why the assumptions made by Theorems hold in practice.

*   **Critical Damping Justification:** The justification for choosing critical damping is somewhat hand-wavy. While the paper mentions avoiding oscillations and overshoot, a more detailed explanation of why this specific damping regime is optimal for diffusion models would be beneficial. What if under-damped or over-damped approaches are used? Is it theoretically backed that Critical Damping could alleviate the "overshoot issue"?

*   **Limited Ablation Studies:** While the paper includes an ablation study on the loss weight warm-up strategy, more ablation experiments could further strengthen the claims. For example:

    *   Ablation on the momentum parameter Î³. How sensitive is the performance to the choice of this parameter?
    *   Comparison with other acceleration techniques beyond increased step size, especially those designed for stochastic differential equations.

*   **Comparison to CLD:** While the comparison to CLD is helpful, it would be useful to provide more insights into why FDM performs better. Is it solely due to the parameter efficiency, or are there fundamental differences in the way the momentum is incorporated?

*   **Reproducibility concerns:** While the statement for reproduciblity exists, it lacks a link to already released code.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Strengthen the theoretical analysis:** Provide a more rigorous connection between the theoretical convergence results and the practical performance improvements. Clarify how the assumptions of the theorems hold in the context of diffusion models.
*   **Provide a more detailed justification for critical damping:** Explain why this specific damping regime is optimal and compare it to other damping strategies.
*   **Conduct more comprehensive ablation studies:** Investigate the sensitivity of performance to the momentum parameter and compare with other acceleration techniques.
*   **Provide more insight into why FDM outperforms CLD.**
*   **Include a link to code**

**Overall:**

The paper presents a promising approach to accelerating diffusion models by incorporating momentum. The empirical results are compelling, and the connection to stochastic optimization is novel. However, the theoretical analysis could be strengthened, and more comprehensive ablation studies would further bolster the claims. With these improvements, this paper could be a significant contribution to the field.
