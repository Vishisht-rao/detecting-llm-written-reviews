OUTPUT:
Following Casarez et al. (2018), this paper introduces MGTST, a novel transformer-based model for multivariate long-term time-series forecasting (MLTSF). The core idea is to address the limitations of existing transformer models, which either overlook crucial cross-channel dependencies or fail to capture temporal patterns across different scales. MGTST proposes three innovative designs: Parallel Multi-Scale Architecture (PMSA), Temporal Embedding with Representation Tokens (TERT), and Cross-Channel Attention and Gated Mechanism (CCAGM). Additionally, a Channel Grouping (CG) strategy is introduced to mitigate channel interaction redundancy for datasets with a large number of channels. The experimental results demonstrate that MGTST outperforms both channel-dependent (CD) and channel-independent (CI) baseline models on seven widely used benchmark datasets.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The paper proposes a novel architecture, MGTST, combining multi-scale and cross-channel dependencies, addressing a recognized gap in the MLTSF literature. The TERT and CCAGM components seem particularly interesting. The channel grouping strategy is a useful addition for high-dimensional time series.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper provides extensive experimental results on seven benchmark datasets, comparing MGTST against strong baselines, including both CD and CI models. The ablation study effectively demonstrates the contribution of PMSA and CCAGM.
*   **Performance Gains:** The experimental results show consistent performance improvements over state-of-the-art models, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The claimed improvement range of 1.5% to 41.9% is significant.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, with a clear explanation of the proposed model and its components. The figures are helpful in visualizing the architecture and the underlying concepts.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors provide a link to the code, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Lack of Detailed Justification for Design Choices:** While the paper introduces the components of MGTST, the reasoning behind some specific design choices could be strengthened. For instance, the specific form of the gating mechanism and the rationale for the patch and stride lengths chosen in the PMSA are not thoroughly explained. More discussion on how these choices were optimized would be beneficial.
*   **Limited Discussion of Computational Cost:** While the paper claims lower FLOPs and parameters compared to some transformer models, the theoretical complexity analysis in Table 3 does not clearly demonstrate a significant advantage over PatchTST. A more detailed analysis of the computational cost, particularly with respect to the different components (PMSA, CCAGM, CG), would be valuable. Section A.5 helps address this somewhat, but a more thorough analysis should be in the main text.
*   **Figure 1 Needs Improvement:** Figure 1, which aims to visualize cross-channel and multi-scale dependencies, is not very convincing. The cross-channel dependency example is vague, and the multi-scale dependency visualization could be more illustrative.
*   **Overclaiming novelty of Representation Tokens:** The paper emphasizes that this is the *first* to introduce representation tokens to transformers for time series, but this should be tempered. The CLS token from BERT and its use in ViT are acknowledged, but the connection to time-series might be more directly addressed in existing literature than is conveyed by the paper's tone.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Provide more in-depth justification for the architectural choices:** Explain the design choices behind the gating mechanism, the patch and stride lengths, and the dimensionality of the latent space. Consider adding an experiment varying these hyperparameters.
*   **Expand the computational complexity analysis:** Provide a more detailed breakdown of the computational cost of each component of MGTST. Compare the FLOPs and parameters of MGTST with other models for different input and output lengths.
*   **Improve Figure 1:** Replace or revise Figure 1 to provide clearer examples of cross-channel and multi-scale dependencies.
*   **More discussion on the limitations:** While the method performs well, the paper should acknowledge potential limitations. For example, under what conditions might the channel grouping strategy fail to be effective? Are there types of time-series data where the multi-scale approach might not be beneficial?
*   **Revise the phrasing regarding the novelty of Representation Tokens** and better acknowledge similar concepts in other time-series literature.

**Overall Recommendation:**

The paper presents a novel and effective transformer-based model for multivariate long-term time-series forecasting. The experimental results are compelling, and the paper is generally well-written. While there are some areas for improvement, as outlined above, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field and is suitable for acceptance. I recommend **acceptance with minor revisions** to address the points raised above.
