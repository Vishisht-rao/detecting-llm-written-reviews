OUTPUT:
Following Ewald et al. (2023), this paper presents a novel approach to link prediction using graph neural networks (GNNs). The core contribution lies in the introduction of the "MPNN-then-SF" architecture and its instantiation as the Neural Common Neighbor (NCN) model. The authors convincingly argue that this architecture offers a superior balance between expressivity and scalability compared to existing "SF-then-MPNN" and "SF-and-MPNN" approaches. Furthermore, the paper addresses the critical issue of graph incompleteness and its impact on common neighbor-based link prediction models, proposing Neural Common Neighbor with Completion (NCNC) to mitigate this issue.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Architecture:** The MPNN-then-SF architecture is a compelling and well-motivated contribution. The paper clearly articulates the limitations of existing approaches and explains how the proposed architecture addresses these limitations. The illustrative example in Figure 3 effectively highlights the expressiveness advantage of NCN.
*   **Addressing Graph Incompleteness:** The paper makes a significant contribution by explicitly addressing the often-overlooked issue of graph incompleteness in link prediction. The visualization of common neighbor distribution shifts and performance degradation due to incompleteness is insightful and provides a strong justification for the proposed completion method.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both NCN and NCNC across a diverse set of benchmark datasets. The ablation study provides valuable insights into the contributions of different components of the model. The scalability analysis further strengthens the practical value of the proposed approach.
*   **Clarity and Readability:** The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The authors provide clear definitions of key concepts and effectively explain the motivation behind their design choices. The inclusion of theoretical proofs in the appendix adds to the rigor of the work.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors have made their code publicly available, which promotes reproducibility and facilitates further research in this area.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Exploration of MPNN-then-SF Design Space:** While the paper introduces the MPNN-then-SF framework, it focuses primarily on the NCN instantiation. A more comprehensive exploration of the design space within this framework, perhaps including a discussion of alternative pooling functions or node sets, would further strengthen the paper.
*   **Incompleteness Analysis Limited to Common Neighbors:** The analysis of graph incompleteness is primarily focused on its impact on common neighbor structures. While this is a relevant and well-motivated focus, the authors acknowledge that incompleteness can affect other structural features as well. Exploring this broader impact, even briefly, would provide a more complete picture.
*   **Potential for Generalization of Completion Method:** The authors propose common neighbor completion (CNC) to address incompleteness. While effective, the paper doesn't discuss the potential for generalizing this completion method to address other structural features that might be affected by incompleteness.
*   **Concerns about the heuristic baseline performance:** The performance of the baselines may be relatively lower than other similar publications, such that the reported gains may be inflated.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand on MPNN-then-SF Design Space:** Include a more detailed discussion of alternative design choices within the MPNN-then-SF framework.
*   **Briefly Discuss Broader Impact of Incompleteness:** Acknowledge and briefly discuss how graph incompleteness might affect other structural features beyond common neighbors.
*   **Address the Potential for Generalizing CNC:** Discuss the possibility of generalizing the CNC technique to address other structural features affected by incompleteness.
*   **Check reproducibility of baseline performance:** Consider re-implementing the baselines to confirm the reported performance numbers.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of link prediction. The introduction of the MPNN-then-SF architecture and the addressing of graph incompleteness are valuable contributions that are likely to have a lasting impact. Despite the minor weaknesses, I recommend acceptance.
