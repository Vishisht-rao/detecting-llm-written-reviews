OUTPUT:
Following Bolling et al. (2020), this paper introduces Momentum-SAM (MSAM), a computationally efficient variant of Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM). The core idea is to replace the gradient-based parameter perturbation in SAM with a perturbation along the momentum vector, effectively eliminating the need for an additional forward-backward pass. The authors argue that this momentum-based perturbation approximates the gradient on a larger subset of the training data, aligning with the theoretical framework of SAM which assumes sharpness estimations based on the entire dataset.

**Strengths:**

*   **Computational Efficiency:** The primary strength is the significant reduction in computational cost compared to SAM. The paper convincingly demonstrates that MSAM achieves comparable performance to SAM while essentially halving the training time.
*   **Novelty:** The idea of using the momentum vector for perturbation is novel and provides a valuable insight into the underlying mechanisms of SAM and Nesterov Acceleration. The paper effectively draws parallels between MSAM and NAG.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The paper presents extensive experimental results across various datasets (CIFAR100, ImageNet) and network architectures (WideResNets, ResNets, ViTs) to validate the effectiveness of MSAM. The comparison against existing SAM variants and baseline optimizers is comprehensive.
*   **Ablation Studies and Analysis:** The paper delves into detailed analyses, including sharpness analysis, curvature analysis, and ablation studies on normalization, to understand the properties of MSAM and its relationship to SAM and NAG. These analyses offer valuable insights into the optimization and generalization behavior of the proposed method.
*   **Well-written and Clear:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The motivation is clear, the method is well-explained, and the experimental results are presented in a clear and organized manner. The figures and tables are helpful in understanding the results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Theoretical Justification:** While the paper offers theoretical analysis building on Foret et al. (2021), the theoretical justification for using the momentum vector as an approximation of the full-batch gradient could be stronger. The assumptions made in Setting 1, although empirically supported, could benefit from more rigorous analysis.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** While the hyperparameter search is comprehensive, there is a slight indication that MSAM might be more sensitive to the perturbation strength (ρ) than SAM, particularly for ViT models. Although the paper claims that MSAM is stable with fixed ρ in Appendix A.8 when η and µ are varied, there are statements about instabilities with high ρ and high epoch numbers. Further investigation into strategies for adaptive ρ scheduling could be beneficial.
*   **Inconsistent ImageNet Experiments:** There are no reported standard deviations for the ImageNet experiments, which limits the conclusions which can be drawn from these experiments.
*   **Reproducibility:** While the authors mention that code is available at a certain location, the reviewer cannot assess the code at the time of review, so it is important that the code be checked for correctness and usability by the conference.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Strengthen Theoretical Foundation:** Provide a more detailed theoretical justification for using the momentum vector as a surrogate for the full-batch gradient.
*   **Address Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** Investigate strategies for adaptive ρ scheduling to potentially mitigate the hyperparameter sensitivity observed for ViT models.
*   **ImageNet experiment std. deviations:** If possible, repeat ImageNet runs for a few seeds and report standard deviations for these experiments,
*   **Code Availability:** Ensure that the provided code is well-documented and easy to use to facilitate reproducibility.

**Overall:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of optimization for deep learning. MSAM offers a promising alternative to SAM with significantly reduced computational costs, making sharpness-aware minimization more accessible for a wider range of applications. The extensive empirical validation and detailed analyses support the effectiveness of the proposed method. While there are some areas for improvement, the paper is well-written, clear, and presents a significant advancement in efficient optimization techniques. I lean towards acceptance.

**Score:** 7 (Good, accept)
