OUTPUT:
Following Deanda et al. (2020), this paper presents a novel adversarial training framework called Pixel-reweighted Adversarial Training (PART) that aims to improve the robustness and accuracy of deep learning models by assigning different perturbation budgets to different pixel regions during adversarial training. The motivation stems from the observation that not all pixels contribute equally to model accuracy and robustness. The core idea is to use class activation mapping (CAM) methods to identify important pixel regions and then reduce the perturbation budget for less important regions while maintaining the budget for important ones. This approach, termed Pixel-Reweighted AE Generation (PRAG), is then integrated into existing adversarial training frameworks. The paper demonstrates through experiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Tiny-ImageNet that PART can achieve improved accuracy and robustness compared to existing adversarial training methods.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The idea of pixel-reweighted adversarial training is novel and well-motivated. The observation that different pixels have different impacts on model prediction is insightful and can be the basis for future work.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is well-written and easy to understand. The problem is clearly defined, and the proposed approach is well-explained. The figures (e.g., Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3) effectively illustrate the key concepts.
*   **Empirical Evaluation:** The experimental results are comprehensive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The paper includes results on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, SVHN, Tiny-ImageNet) and evaluates against different adversarial attacks (PGD, MMA, AA), including adaptive attacks.  The ablation studies, particularly the hyperparameter analysis of ϵlow, are valuable.
*   **Generality:** The paper emphasizes the generality of the PART framework and its seamless integration with different AT, CAM, and AE generation methods. This highlights the potential for PART to be easily adopted and extended.
*   **Thorough Ablations:** The appendix include a number of helpful ablations studying the choice of CAM method, how often to update the mask, extra cost introduced by the CAM method, the number of iterations, and adaptive attacks.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Theoretical Justification:** While the paper provides a theoretical analysis in Section 3.3, it is limited to a simple linear model and does not fully explain the effectiveness of PART in complex deep neural networks. The remark that the AE dependence makes theoretical generalization difficult is acknowledged, but more insights or a stronger theoretical grounding would be beneficial.
*   **Adaptive Attack Discussion:** The adaptive attack designed in the paper seems rather simple (increasing epsilon_low). More sophisticated adaptive attacks that specifically target the CAM-identified important regions (e.g., by intentionally manipulating those regions) might reveal potential vulnerabilities. A defense is only as good as the attacks it can withstand.
*   **Burn-in Period Justification:** The paper mentions a burn-in period to improve the classifier's initial ability to identify important pixel regions. A stronger justification or ablation study to demonstrate the importance of the burn-in period would be beneficial.
*   **Hyperparameter Selection (ϵlow):** The paper admits that the selection of ϵlow is currently heuristic (ϵlow=ϵ−1/255) and states that designing an efficient searching algorithm for ϵlow is future work. Given the sensitivity to ϵlow shown in Figure 4, this is a significant limitation. Without a good way to set it, the method may be difficult to deploy.
*   **Minor Clarity Issues:**
    *   The notation in Section 3.1 and Appendix D are a bit dense and could be simplified for better readability.
    *   The discussion of ℓ2-norm constraints in Appendix A seems a bit disconnected from the main contribution. Consider moving it to supplementary material or omitting it if it doesn't add significant value.
    *   In algorithm 1, the "if wi > 1" condition would set the mask to epsilon_low/epsilon when it is supposed to set the mask to 1.0 when the pixel is important. This is not the intended behaviour.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Strengthen Theoretical Analysis:** While a full theoretical analysis of deep learning models under adversarial training is challenging, exploring simpler approximations or providing more intuitive explanations for why PART works would be valuable.
*   **More Sophisticated Adaptive Attacks:**  Develop and evaluate against more sophisticated adaptive attacks that specifically target the weaknesses of the PART framework.
*   **Elaborate on Burn-in Period:**  Provide a more detailed explanation of why the burn-in period is necessary and include an ablation study to demonstrate its effectiveness.
*   **Address ϵlow Selection:** While a complete solution for selecting ϵlow might be beyond the scope of this paper, exploring potential heuristics or providing guidelines for setting this parameter would be helpful. The current approach of fixing it at ϵ - 1/255 seems rather arbitrary.
*   **Simplify Notation:** Streamline the notation used in Section 3.1 and Appendix D to improve readability.

**Overall:**

The paper presents a promising and novel approach to adversarial training. The idea of pixel-reweighted adversarial training is well-motivated, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness. While some limitations exist, particularly regarding theoretical justification and hyperparameter selection, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field and is worthy of acceptance. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper.
