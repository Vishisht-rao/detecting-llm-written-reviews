OUTPUT:
Following Drews et al. (2019), this paper addresses the important problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) node detection in graphs, a relatively under-explored area compared to OOD detection in other domains. The paper proposes a novel and theoretically motivated approach, GRASP (GRaph-Augmented Score Propagation), which leverages OOD score propagation and edge augmentation to improve OOD detection performance. The paper provides both theoretical justification and empirical validation of the proposed method, demonstrating its effectiveness across various datasets and settings.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The paper tackles a significant and timely problem in graph learning. The proposed approach of OOD score propagation and edge augmentation is novel and well-motivated.
*   **Theoretical Foundation:** The paper provides a solid theoretical analysis of OOD score propagation, identifying the key conditions under which it is beneficial. The theorems provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of the proposed method. The formal theorems and proofs in the appendix add rigor to the claims.
*   **Practical Solution:** GRASP is presented as a practical and easily implementable solution that can be integrated with existing OOD scoring functions without requiring retraining. The greedy approach for selecting the subset G is computationally efficient.
*   **Extensive Empirical Evaluation:** The paper presents a comprehensive set of experiments on a diverse range of graph datasets, including both small-scale and large-scale benchmarks. The experimental results consistently demonstrate the superior performance of GRASP compared to strong baselines. The ablation studies provide further insights into the design choices and the validity of the theoretical findings.
*   **Clarity and Organization:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the main ideas and contributions. The figures and tables are helpful in illustrating the proposed method and presenting the experimental results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Selection of hyperparameter *k***: The paper mentions setting the hyperparameter *k* as 8 without a good motivation. An experimental comparison or theoretical analysis would strongly strengthen the choice of this important hyperparameter.
*   **Clarity on "Informal" vs "Formal" Theorems:** The distinction between the informal and formal theorems could be clearer. While the informal theorems provide a high-level overview, the paper should ensure the formal theorems are also accessible to a wider audience. Perhaps adding more intuition after stating the formal theorems would help.
*   **Limited Discussion on Computational Cost:** While the paper mentions the efficiency of the greedy approach for selecting the subset G, it would be beneficial to provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of GRASP, especially for large-scale graphs.
*   **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters**: A further analysis of the sensitivity of GRASP's performance to its hyperparameters (e.g., α, β, Ng) would make the evaluation more robust.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Hyperparameter k Choice Justification:** Include analysis on choice of k.
*   **Theorem Accessibility:** Add more intuition and explanation to make the formal theorems more accessible.
*   **Computational Cost Analysis:** Provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of GRASP, particularly for large graphs.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis:** Include a more detailed analysis of the sensitivity of GRASP to its hyperparameters.
*   **Figure Quality:** Improve the resolution and clarity of Figure 5 to enhance readability.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a strong contribution to the field of graph OOD detection. The proposed method, GRASP, is well-motivated, theoretically sound, and empirically effective. The paper addresses an important problem and provides valuable insights and a practical solution. Despite the minor weaknesses mentioned above, the paper is of high quality and deserves acceptance.
