OUTPUT:
Following Eubank et al. (2017), this paper introduces Learned Proximal Networks (LPNs) for solving inverse problems. The core idea is to parameterize neural networks as exact proximal operators of learned, potentially non-convex, regularizers. The paper addresses a significant gap in the plug-and-play (PnP) framework by providing provable guarantees that the learned denoiser is indeed a proximal operator, enabling convergence guarantees. The paper also introduces a novel "proximal matching" training strategy to promote recovery of the true data log-prior, which is a critical contribution.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The idea of learning provably exact proximal operators using neural networks is innovative and addresses a fundamental limitation of current PnP methods. The proximal matching loss is a significant contribution that directly aims at learning the MAP estimate.
*   **Theoretical Foundation:** The paper is well-grounded in optimization theory and provides rigorous proofs for the key results, including the characterization of LPNs as proximal operators and the convergence of PnP algorithms using LPNs. The detailed proofs in the appendix are commendable.
*   **Convergence Guarantees:** The paper provides convergence guarantees for PnP-ADMM (and PnP-PGD) with LPNs under reasonable assumptions, which is a major step forward in the field. These guarantees are stronger and require fewer assumptions than many existing PnP methods.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The experiments cover a range of problems, from learning a 1D Laplacian distribution to image deblurring and CT reconstruction. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of LPNs in recovering the correct priors and achieving state-of-the-art performance in inverse problems. The detailed discussion of the experiments is very helpful, and the code release will encourage further research.
*   **Interpretability:**  The ability to evaluate the learned regularizer (log-prior) at arbitrary points allows for greater interpretability of the learned model, providing insights into what the network has learned about the data. This aspect of the work is a welcome change from the typical black-box nature of deep learning methods for inverse problems.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the key concepts and results.  The inclusion of a recipe for proving convergence is a nice contribution for the community.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Activation Constraints:**  The reliance on C2 convex, non-decreasing activation functions, such as Softplus, might limit the expressiveness of the network compared to more commonly used activations like ReLU. While alternatives exist, as mentioned in the paper, the potential impact on performance needs to be carefully considered.
*   **Proximal Matching Implementation:** The progressive decrease of γ in the proximal matching loss requires careful tuning. While the authors provide a schedule, the sensitivity of the results to this schedule and the optimal range for γ could be discussed in more detail. Further, while theoretically sound, the practical considerations and approximation inherent in using a finite γ (rather than the limit) could be elaborated on.
*   **Computational Cost:** Learning and inverting the learned prior can be computationally expensive, as evidenced by the training times and the inversion steps used for evaluation. This aspect should be discussed further, especially in the context of practical applications.
*   **Limited Comparisons:** While the paper compares against several state-of-the-art methods, including more detailed comparisons with the explicit regularizers, gradient descent denoisers, and diffusion models would strengthen the work. For instance, it would be insightful to see how LPN compares against unrolled networks or more complex diffusion approaches.
*   **O-minimal structure assumption:** While used for proof, the assumption that *h* is definable in an o-minimal structure could be expanded a bit more. While broad classes of functions satisfy it, providing more intuition and examples beyond simple polynomials might benefit some readers.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Activation Choice Discussion:** Provide a more detailed discussion of the choice of activation function and its impact on expressiveness and performance. Consider exploring alternatives and providing justifications for the chosen softplus function.
*   **Proximal Matching Details:** Expand on the details of the proximal matching training strategy, including a sensitivity analysis of the γ schedule and a discussion of the trade-offs between approximation accuracy and computational cost.
*   **Computational Cost Analysis:** Provide a more thorough analysis of the computational cost of LPNs, including both training and inference times. Consider strategies for reducing the computational burden, such as network pruning or efficient inversion techniques.
*   **More Diverse Experiments:** The image deblurring, sparse-view CT, and compressed sensing are excellent examples. Demonstrating LPN in other inverse problems, such as super-resolution or inpainting, or even non-imaging modalities, would broaden its appeal and strengthen its contribution.
*   **Addressing Failure Cases:** The paper would benefit from discussing limitations and potential failure cases of LPNs. Under what conditions might the learned prior be inaccurate or lead to poor reconstruction results?

**Overall:**

This is a strong and well-motivated paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of inverse problems and plug-and-play methods. The theoretical foundation, convergence guarantees, and experimental results are impressive. Despite some minor weaknesses, the paper is highly recommended for acceptance. The combination of provable guarantees and state-of-the-art results make this paper a significant advance in the field, providing a framework for developing more interpretable and reliable deep learning models for inverse problems.
