OUTPUT:
Following Lorenz et al. (2022), this paper introduces Quantal Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (QARL), a novel approach to robust reinforcement learning that leverages the connection between entropy regularization and bounded rationality. The core idea is to ease the complex saddle-point optimization problem inherent in Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (RARL) by training against an adversary whose rationality is gradually increased in a curriculum fashion. This is achieved by modulating the temperature parameter of an entropy-regularized objective function, effectively transitioning from a simpler maximization problem to a more complex minimax optimization.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The idea of using a curriculum based on bounded rationality is a fresh perspective on adversarial RL. It provides a principled way to manage the complexity of the minimax optimization, addressing a known weakness of RARL.
*   **Theoretical Foundation:** The paper provides a clear and well-motivated theoretical framework. Connecting the entropy-regularized objective to the Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) provides a solid justification for the proposed approach. Proposition 4.3 effectively links temperature-conditioned policies with QRE, allowing the authors to derive a way of modeling the bounded rationality of the adversary.
*   **Algorithm Design:** The proposed QARL algorithm is well-defined and relatively straightforward to implement. The automatic curriculum generation scheme, based on optimizing the temperature distribution while maintaining protagonist performance, is a key contribution. The derivation of the constrained optimization problem (Eq. 10) and its solution via the Lagrangian (Eq. 11) showcases a deep understanding of the underlying mathematics.
*   **Empirical Evaluation:** The experimental results on a diverse set of MuJoCo environments demonstrate the effectiveness of QARL. The comparison against RARL, MixedNE-LD, CAT, Force-Curriculum, and SAC provides strong evidence that QARL achieves superior performance and robustness. Furthermore, the maze navigation task convincingly showcases the ability of QARL to learn complex and robust policies. The inclusion of multiple baselines as well as ablations strengthens the validity of the results.
*   **Completeness:** The appendix contains considerable and worthwhile information regarding hyperparameters, the design of the Mujoco simulations, as well as the details of the algorithms used in the paper. These extra details contribute to the completeness and reproducibility of the paper.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity of Writing:** While the technical content is sound, certain parts of the paper could benefit from clearer writing and organization. The introduction could be more concise in stating the problem and the proposed solution. Certain derivations could benefit from further unpacking.
*   **Justification of the Target Distribution:** The choice of the target distribution µ = Γ(1, 10<sup>-3</sup>) for the temperature is not explicitly justified. While approximating a Dirac distribution centered at 0 is intuitive, a more detailed explanation of why this specific gamma distribution was selected would strengthen the argument.
*   **Computational Cost:** The algorithm includes a constrained optimisation loop, that involves sampling temperatures and estimating a value function. It would be helpful to better understand the computational costs associated to the automatic curriculum generation.
*   **Limited Real-World Validation:** The experiments are primarily conducted in simulated MuJoCo environments. While these environments are valuable for benchmarking, it would be beneficial to explore the applicability of QARL to real-world robotic tasks or other domains where robustness is crucial.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Improve Clarity:** Revise the introduction to be more focused and concise. Elaborate on the practical benefits of using entropy regularization in adversarial RL. Consider adding pseudocode or diagrams to better illustrate the QARL algorithm.
*   **Justify Design Choices:** Provide a more detailed explanation for the choice of the target distribution µ. Discuss the sensitivity of QARL to different values of the parameters in the target distribution. Elaborate on the computational cost of the curriculum generation.
*   **Expand Evaluation:** Explore the applicability of QARL to more complex and realistic scenarios. Consider testing the algorithm on real-world robotics tasks or other domains that require robust RL.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that introduces a novel and theoretically sound approach to robust adversarial reinforcement learning. QARL addresses a critical challenge in RL by effectively managing the complexity of the minimax optimization problem. The empirical results convincingly demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of QARL compared to existing methods. While some aspects of the writing and evaluation could be improved, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field and is worthy of acceptance.
