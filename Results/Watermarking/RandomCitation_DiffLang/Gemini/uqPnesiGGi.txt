OUTPUT:
Following Hartnett et al. (2022), this paper presents a novel motif-aware attribute masking strategy (MoAMa) for pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on molecular graphs. The key idea is to mask entire motifs within a molecule, forcing the GNN to learn long-range dependencies and inter-motif relationships, rather than relying solely on local neighboring node features. The paper argues that this approach addresses limitations of random attribute masking, which often over-emphasizes intra-motif learning and hinders the capture of crucial long-range interactions important for molecular property prediction.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Idea:** The motif-aware masking strategy is a conceptually sound and innovative approach to GNN pre-training for molecular property prediction. The idea of leveraging chemical motifs to guide the masking process is well-motivated and grounded in domain knowledge.
*   **Clear Motivation:** The paper clearly articulates the shortcomings of random attribute masking strategies and provides a compelling rationale for the proposed motif-aware approach. The benzene ring example in the introduction is effective in illustrating the problem.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The authors conduct extensive experiments on eight molecular property prediction datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of MoAMa compared to a range of competitive baselines, including both contrastive learning and attribute reconstruction methods. The ablation studies thoroughly investigate the design space of the proposed masking strategy.
*   **Quantitative Analysis of Inter-motif Influence:** The paper introduces inter-motif influence measurements (InfRatio and MRR) to quantitatively assess the impact of the pre-training strategies on long-range dependency learning. This provides valuable insights beyond just downstream task performance.
*   **Well-written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written, clearly structured, and easy to follow. The figures and tables are helpful in visualizing the method and presenting the results.
*   **BRICS Algorithm for Motif Extraction:** The use of BRICS is a good choice for motif extraction.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Computational Complexity of Influence Evaluation:** While the authors address the computational complexity of inter-motif influence evaluation in the Appendix, a more detailed discussion of the practical implications would be beneficial. How long does the influence analysis take for a typical dataset? What are the memory requirements?
*   **Parameter Sensitivity of Motif Sampling:** The paper mentions flexibility in the alpha parameter (masking ratio). A brief discussion on the sensitivity of the method to this range and the influence of the motif sizes would be beneficial.
*   **Lack of Comparison to More Recent Methods:** The field of graph representation learning is rapidly evolving. While the baselines are reasonable, it would strengthen the paper to compare against more recent state-of-the-art pre-training methods that have emerged since the submission of the cited papers.
*    **Limited number of regression tasks**. The paper provides a strong set of results for classification, but the regression result section includes results from only 3 data sets. The paper would be significantly stronger if regression results would be expanded.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand on the discussion of computational complexity of influence evaluation, and discuss parameter sensitivity of motif sampling.** Provide more details on the practical aspects of inter-motif influence evaluation. Address impact of motif size, alpha, etc.
*   **Consider adding more recent baseline methods.** Include comparisons to more recent SOTA methods in graph pre-training to ensure the paper remains competitive.
*   **Address limitations of BRICS:** A brief acknowledgement of BRICS limitations and any implications on the current research would be beneficial.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective motif-aware attribute masking strategy for GNN pre-training on molecular graphs. The clear motivation, comprehensive evaluation, and quantitative analysis of inter-motif influence make this a valuable contribution to the field. Addressing the minor weaknesses and suggestions outlined above would further enhance the paper's impact. The method is sound, and the results are promising. I would recommend this paper for acceptance, conditional on addressing the suggested improvements.
