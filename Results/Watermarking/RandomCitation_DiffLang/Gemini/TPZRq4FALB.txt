OUTPUT:
Following Sotelo et al. (2014), this paper introduces the concept of "reliability bias" in multi-modal test-time adaptation (TTA), a novel challenge arising from information discrepancies across modalities due to intra-modal distribution shifts. The authors argue that existing TTA methods, designed primarily for uni-modal tasks, fail to address this bias, leading to performance degradation in multi-modal scenarios. They propose a method called READ (REliable fusion and robust ADaptation) to mitigate this issue. READ leverages a self-adaptive attention mechanism for reliable cross-modal fusion and a confidence-aware loss function for robust adaptation. The paper also contributes two new benchmarks for evaluating multi-modal TTA under reliability bias. Experimental results on these benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of READ compared to state-of-the-art TTA methods.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Problem Definition:** The identification and formalization of "reliability bias" as a specific challenge in multi-modal TTA is a significant contribution. This highlights a previously overlooked aspect of domain adaptation in multi-modal settings.
*   **Well-Motivated Approach:** The proposed method, READ, is well-motivated and addresses the identified reliability bias directly. The self-adaptive attention mechanism allows for dynamic weighting of modalities based on their reliability, and the confidence-aware loss function promotes robust adaptation by focusing on confident predictions and mitigating the impact of noisy ones.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The introduction of two new benchmarks is a valuable contribution to the field, enabling comprehensive evaluation of multi-modal TTA methods under reliability bias. The experimental results on these benchmarks provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of READ.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The problem is clearly defined, the proposed method is well-explained, and the experimental results are presented in a clear and concise manner. The figures are helpful in visualizing the problem and the proposed solution.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Theoretical Analysis:** While the confidence-aware loss function is well-motivated and empirically effective, the theoretical justification could be strengthened. The paper includes theorems regarding the gradient direction and value, but a deeper analysis of the loss's convergence properties and its impact on generalization would be beneficial.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** Although the authors performed a sensitivitiy analysis of the parameter , showing some stability, more discussion about the process of choosing is needed, alongside some general guide for choosing the best value of it.
*   **Scope of Experiments:** The experiments focus primarily on audio-visual tasks. While these are relevant multi-modal scenarios, exploring the performance of READ on other multi-modal tasks, such as those involving text and images, could broaden the paper's impact.
*   **Comparison to Imbalanced Multi-Modal Learning:** The paper differentiates itself from imbalanced multi-modal learning, but further clarifying the distinctions and potentially incorporating insights from that field could strengthen the paper. For example, could ideas from imbalanced learning be used to improve the confidence estimation in the confidence-aware loss?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Strengthen Theoretical Analysis:** Provide a more in-depth theoretical analysis of the confidence-aware loss function, including its convergence properties and generalization bounds.
*   **Explore Other Multi-Modal Tasks:** Evaluate the performance of READ on a wider range of multi-modal tasks, including those involving text and images.
*   **Address Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** Discuss the choice of the hyperparameter in more detail and provide guidance for selecting appropriate values for different datasets and tasks.
*   **Further Clarify Distinctions from Imbalanced Multi-Modal Learning:** Provide a more detailed comparison to imbalanced multi-modal learning and potentially explore the integration of ideas from that field into the READ framework.
*   **Ablation Studies on Attention:** Conduct more detailed ablation studies on different aspects of the self-adaptive attention mechanism, such as the effect of updating different sets of parameters.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of multi-modal test-time adaptation. The identification of "reliability bias" as a specific challenge is a valuable insight, and the proposed method, READ, provides an effective solution. The paper is well-written and well-supported by experimental results. Addressing the weaknesses mentioned above would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact.
