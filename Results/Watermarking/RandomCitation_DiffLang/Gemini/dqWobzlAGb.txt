OUTPUT:
Following Frantz et al. (2022), this paper investigates the suitability of different Thurston geometries for embedding brain connectomes. The core argument is that while hyperbolic geometry has gained traction, other geometries, particularly Solv, might offer better or complementary representations of the complex relationships within these networks, echoing Thurston's own suggestion. The paper introduces a novel Simulated Annealing (SA) based embedding algorithm, assesses the goodness-of-fit of 21 connectomes across 15 tessellations (Euclidean, Spherical, Hyperbolic, Solv, Nil, and product geometries), and compares performance using standard network embedding metrics.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The paper's exploration of Thurston geometries beyond the commonly used Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical spaces is a significant contribution. The focus on Solv geometry, inspired by Thurston's own ideas, is particularly compelling. To the authors' best knowledge, they are the first to do such a comparison
*   **Methodology:** The development of a new embedding algorithm based on Simulated Annealing is a valuable technical contribution. The algorithm's adaptability across various geometries, including the computationally challenging Solv geometry, is impressive. The comparison against previous approaches is well-done and shows the effectiveness of the developed SA method.
*   **Extensive Evaluation:** The evaluation on a diverse set of 21 connectomes from 8 species provides a robust basis for the findings. The use of multiple quality measures (mAP, MeanRank, greedy routing success and stretch, NLL) offers a comprehensive assessment of embedding performance.
*   **Robustness Checks:** The inclusion of robustness checks to examine the impacts of grid size and iterations for SA on the final solution shows the integrity of the authors' approach and dedication to obtaining accurate findings.
*   **Clear Presentation (Mostly):** The paper is generally well-structured, with a clear introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion. The motivations for exploring different geometries and the details of the algorithm are explained in a logical manner.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Abstractness of Geometries:** While the paper mentions the challenges of visualizing and understanding Solv and Nil geometries, a deeper intuitive explanation of *why* these geometries might be well-suited for connectomes is needed. For instance, the authors mention "opposing hierarchies" in Solv, but this should be grounded to properties of neural networks.
*   **Limited Justification for Tessellations:** While the authors mention using the implementation in RogueViz, the specific choice of 15 tessellations is not fully justified. Why these particular subdivisions and closed manifolds? How were parameters chosen for defining D, M, dR?
*   **Over-Reliance on Black-Box Optimization:** Simulated Annealing is powerful but can be opaque. More insight into the parameter tuning (especially the cooling schedule and neighborhood definition) would enhance the paper. Also, while showing that SA improves upon existing methods is good, understanding why (e.g., what biases in existing embedding approaches does it overcome) would be a great addition.
*   **Inconsistent Performance Metrics:** The observation that optimizing log-likelihood can negatively affect greedy success rate and stretch is concerning. The authors acknowledge this, but a deeper investigation into *why* this discrepancy occurs is crucial. Are these measures capturing different aspects of network structure, and if so, what are they? Is there a need for a combined objective function?
*   **Presentation could be improved:** While generally clear, the text contains numerous typos (e.g., "conections," "cognititive," "sucessfully," "sucess rate") and grammatical errors. While this is under double blind review, these detractions add up. Furthermore, several variables are inconsistently capitalized, making it challenging to follow the formulas. The figures and tables (especially those in the appendix) are sometimes hard to read due to small font sizes.
*   **Ambiguity around SA implementation:** There is some ambiguity around the iterative refinement of R and T during the SA process. Was there a penalty associated with each of these refinements or an adjustment made when a particular change was incorporated?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Elaborate on Geometry Intuition:** Provide more biological and neurological insights into why Solv and Nil geometries could be relevant for connectome modeling. Connect the abstract properties of these spaces to the specific characteristics of brain networks.
*   **Justify Tessellation Choices:** Offer a rationale for selecting the 15 tessellations used in the experiments. Explain the criteria for choosing parameters like grid density and diameter.
*   **Provide SA Implementation Details:** Include more details about the Simulated Annealing algorithm, such as the cooling schedule, neighborhood definition, and parameter tuning process. Discuss the computational cost of the algorithm. Explain in more detail how the values of R and T are updated during SA.
*   **Investigate Metric Discrepancies:** Conduct a deeper analysis of the conflicting results between log-likelihood optimization and greedy routing performance. Explore potential explanations for this discrepancy and suggest alternative objective functions or evaluation strategies.
*   **Address Presentation Issues:** Carefully proofread the paper to correct typos and grammatical errors. Improve the formatting of figures and tables to enhance readability.

**Overall:**

The paper presents a valuable and original contribution to the field of connectome analysis. The exploration of Thurston geometries and the development of a new embedding algorithm are significant strengths. While the paper has some weaknesses, particularly in its explanation of the underlying geometries and the inconsistencies in performance metrics, the overall quality is high. Addressing the suggestions for improvement would further enhance the impact and clarity of this work. I would recommend this paper for acceptance, pending minor revisions.
