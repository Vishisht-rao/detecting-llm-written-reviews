OUTPUT:
Following Baeza et al. (2021), this paper introduces Graph Parsing Networks (GPNs), a novel approach to graph pooling that leverages a graph parsing algorithm inspired by bottom-up grammar induction. The paper addresses two key limitations of existing hierarchical graph pooling methods: the trade-off between memory efficiency and node information preservation, and the inability to learn personalized pooling structures for individual graphs.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The core idea of using a graph parsing algorithm to infer a personalized pooling structure is innovative and well-motivated. Drawing inspiration from grammar induction is a compelling analogy.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the GPN architecture, the graph parsing algorithm, and its components. The definitions and algorithm description are easy to follow. The propositions regarding time complexity, permutation invariance, and graph connectivity are stated and proven (though proofs are relegated to the appendix).
*   **Empirical Validation:** The paper presents a comprehensive set of experiments on standard graph classification and node classification benchmarks. The results demonstrate that GPN outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph classification tasks and achieves competitive performance on node classification tasks. The graph reconstruction task provides visual evidence of GPN's ability to preserve node information. The efficiency studies (memory and time) further strengthen the paper's claims.
*   **Ablation Study:** The ablation study effectively highlights the contribution of each module in the proposed framework and showcases the importance of graph locality for the graph parsing algorithm.
*   **Clarity and Organization:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The introduction clearly outlines the problem, the proposed solution, and the contributions. The figures and tables are informative and well-integrated into the text.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors provide details about datasets, implementation, and model tuning in the Appendix and claim to release code, promoting reproducibility.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Discussion of Limitations:** While the paper mentions a potential limitation regarding batch processing of graphs with varying numbers of pooling layers, a more thorough discussion of the model's limitations would be beneficial. Specifically, it would be useful to discuss cases where the grammar induction analogy might break down or where the parsing algorithm might fail to produce meaningful pooling structures. The sensitivity to hyperparameter settings could also be discussed.
*   **Oversmoothing:** The paper touches on over-smoothing in section E, however it doesn't fully address the concern. The skip connections help but may not be enough. More analysis into how GPN combats over-smoothing, potentially through visualizations or experiments, would strengthen the paper.
*   **Clarity of "Dominant Edge" Concept:** While Algorithm 1 is well-defined, the intuitive meaning of the "dominant edge" in the context of graph pooling could be further clarified. Providing an example of how different edge scores influence the resulting pooling structure would be helpful.
*   **Dependence on Edge Scores:** The algorithm's performance relies heavily on the quality of the edge scores produced by the GNN and MLP.  Are there specific properties that these edge scores should possess to ensure effective parsing? Are the results sensitive to the specific architecture of the GNN/MLP used to generate these scores?
*   **Presentation of Proofs:** While the proofs are provided, relegating them to the Appendix makes it harder to assess the theoretical claims. Including key elements of the proofs in the main body of the paper, or providing a more detailed summary, would be preferable.
*   **The Film dataset shows relatively poor performance.** A discussion of why it struggles on this particular node classification task may be beneficial.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   Expand the discussion of limitations, including potential failure modes of the parsing algorithm, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and the impact of node features on pooling results.
*   Provide more intuitive explanation on how the edge scoring works, and how it relates to different graph structures.
*   Include elements of the proofs in the main paper, or a more detailed summary.
*   Provide more details on the architecture and training of GNN, in order to allow people to reproduce the results.
*   Discuss possible connections between edge scores and grammar scores of grammar induction.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of graph pooling. The proposed GPN architecture and graph parsing algorithm are novel, technically sound, and empirically validated. Despite some minor weaknesses, the paper is well-written, organized, and promotes reproducibility. It is a strong candidate for acceptance.
