OUTPUT:
Following Niemi et al. (2020), this paper introduces a novel game-theoretic second-order optimizer, GTSONO, specifically designed for training robust Neural ODEs. The core idea revolves around recasting the Neural ODE optimization problem as a min-max optimal control problem, where an adversarial control term is introduced to model system disturbances. The paper presents a computationally efficient framework based on min-max Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) and leverages Kronecker product properties for matrix factorization to reduce computational burden. Theoretical convergence guarantees to local saddle points are provided. The authors empirically demonstrate the increased robustness of GTSONO compared to benchmark optimizers (Adam, SGD, SNOpt) against adversarial attacks on CIFAR10 and SVHN datasets, even when trained on clean images. Furthermore, they showcase the successful adaptation of GTSONO to existing adversarial training methods (FreeAT, TRADES), resulting in enhanced robustness and faster convergence.

Strengths:

*   **Novelty:** The proposed GTSONO optimizer offers a fresh perspective by framing Neural ODE training as a game-theoretic optimal control problem. The adversarial control approach to robustness is interesting.
*   **Computational Efficiency:** The paper highlights the computational benefits of GTSONO due to efficient matrix decompositions using Kronecker product properties. This addresses a crucial practical concern in training Neural ODEs.
*   **Theoretical Guarantees:** Providing convergence guarantees to local saddle points adds theoretical soundness to the proposed algorithm.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The experimental results demonstrate the superior robustness of GTSONO compared to benchmark optimizers on both CIFAR10 and SVHN datasets. The successful adaptation to existing adversarial training methods further strengthens the empirical validation. The comparisons between DDP-GTSONO and GDA-GTSONO also provides useful ablation study.
*   **Clarity of Contribution:** The paper clearly outlines its contributions, including the novel optimizer, convergence guarantees, improved robustness, and successful adaptation to adversarial training.

Weaknesses:

*   **Computational Cost:** While the paper emphasizes computational benefits, it also acknowledges the slower per-iteration training time and higher memory consumption of GTSONO compared to first-order methods like Adam and SGD. More detailed analysis and comparison with other second-order optimizers in terms of practical wall-clock time for equivalent performance would be beneficial. While the appendix provides some data, this should be further emphasized in the main text.
*   **Assumptions:** The paper makes assumptions (3.1 and A.1) regarding the running cost and the independence of network activations. These assumptions should be discussed in more detail, including their potential limitations and impact on the algorithm's performance in different scenarios.
*   **Robust Overfitting:** The paper mentions the issue of robust overfitting in Neural ODE models, which affects both GTSONO and benchmark optimizers. This is a critical limitation and requires further investigation and potential solutions. The paper should include a deeper dive into techniques to mitigate robust overfitting in the future.
*   **Limited Network Architectures:** The experiments are conducted on a specific network architecture. Expanding the evaluation to a wider range of architectures (e.g., ResNets, Transformers) would demonstrate the generalizability of GTSONO.
*   **CW Attack Performance:** The results in Tables 3 and 4 showing inferior performance under the CW attack when using GTSONO-adapted FreeAT and TRADES are somewhat concerning. The paper should provide a more in-depth explanation and analysis of this phenomenon.
*   **Minor Clarification Needed:** The introduction mentions that the proposed method considers the disturbance being "injected through the antagonizing control." A more explicit connection between the adversarial input and the antagonizing control in the Neural ODE formulation could improve clarity.
*   **Presentation:** While generally well-written, some parts, especially those involving mathematical derivations and Kronecker product manipulations, could benefit from further simplification and more intuitive explanations. The paper could also benefit from a diagram/flowchart depicting the interaction between u and v.

Overall:

The paper presents a promising game-theoretic optimizer for training robust Neural ODEs. The combination of theoretical foundations, computational efficiency considerations, and empirical validation makes it a valuable contribution to the field. However, addressing the identified weaknesses, particularly regarding computational cost, assumption limitations, robust overfitting, CW attack performance, and expanding the range of network architectures, would significantly strengthen the paper and its impact.
