OUTPUT:
Following Bonham et al. (2022), this paper presents a compelling argument for re-evaluating the scale and nature of data used in self-supervised image representation learning. The authors introduce the "Walking Tours" dataset, consisting of long, high-resolution, unlabelled first-person videos of urban environments. They then propose DORA, a novel self-supervised learning method that leverages object tracking within these continuous video streams to learn robust image encoders.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Dataset:** The "Walking Tours" dataset is a significant contribution. Its characteristics – long duration, high resolution, egocentric perspective, and natural scene transitions – offer a data source that more closely mimics human visual experience compared to existing image or video datasets used for pretraining. The detailed analysis comparing it to other datasets is convincing.
*   **Interesting Method (DORA):** The "tracking to learn to recognize" approach embodied by DORA is well-motivated and innovative. The use of cross-attention and Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm for discovering and tracking objects within the video frames is clever. The visualizations of the attention maps provide qualitative evidence of the method's effectiveness.
*   **Strong Experimental Results:** The paper provides strong experimental evidence demonstrating that DORA, pretrained on a single "Walking Tours" video, can achieve competitive or superior performance compared to ImageNet-pretrained models on several downstream tasks, including semantic segmentation, object detection, video object segmentation and object tracking. The ablation studies are thorough and provide insights into the importance of different components of DORA. Pretraining on all WT videos gives best results.
*   **Well-Written and Clear:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The diagrams and tables are helpful in understanding the method and results.
*   **Addresses a Relevant Problem:** The paper tackles the question of data efficiency in self-supervised learning, which is becoming increasingly important as models and datasets grow larger.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Dataset Size:** While the "Walking Tours" dataset is novel, it is relatively small compared to ImageNet or other large-scale video datasets. It contains only 10 videos. Although the authors show promising results with a single video and 10 videos, further scaling the dataset could lead to even better performance.
*   **Dependence on ViT Architecture:** The method is presented and evaluated specifically within the ViT framework. While ViTs are powerful, it would be beneficial to explore the applicability of DORA to other architectures, such as CNNs.
*   **Lack of Detailed Discussion on Failure Cases:** While the paper presents compelling results, it would be helpful to include a discussion of potential failure cases or limitations of DORA. For example, how does DORA handle videos with rapid camera movements or significant occlusions?
*   **Computational Cost:** Although the paper argues for data efficiency, it does not explicitly address the computational cost of the DORA pretraining procedure compared to other self-supervised methods. The SK algorithm might be expensive.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand the "Walking Tours" dataset:** Efforts to increase the size of the dataset would further strengthen the paper's claims and potentially lead to even better performance.
*   **Investigate Applicability to Other Architectures:** Exploring the application of DORA to other architectures would broaden the impact of the work.
*   **Include a Discussion of Failure Cases:** Addressing the potential limitations of DORA would provide a more complete and balanced evaluation.
*   **Analyze Computational Cost:** Providing a comparison of the computational cost of DORA to other methods would be valuable for practitioners.
*   **More in depth explain the chosen parameters, such as k=3 for object tracking, giving more intuition behind it, rather than only stating the chosen value.**

**Overall:**

Despite these minor weaknesses, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of self-supervised learning. The "Walking Tours" dataset and the DORA method offer a promising new direction for learning robust image representations from video data. The paper is well-written, well-supported by experimental evidence, and tackles an important problem. This paper is worthy of acceptance.
