OUTPUT:
Following Kerrigan et al. (2019), this paper presents a novel benchmark dataset and a corresponding methodology for predicting vibroacoustic frequency responses of vibrating plates with varying geometries. The problem is well-motivated by the practical need to accelerate vibroacoustic simulations, which are traditionally computationally expensive. The paper makes a significant contribution by providing a structured benchmark specifically tailored to frequency response prediction, filling a gap in existing scientific machine learning benchmarks. The proposed Frequency Query Operator (FQ-Operator) shows promising results, outperforming several established baseline methods like DeepONets and Fourier Neural Operators.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Relevance:** The paper addresses a relevant and under-explored problem in vibroacoustics. The creation of a benchmark dataset for frequency response prediction is a valuable contribution to the field.
*   **Problem Formulation and Dataset:** The problem is clearly defined, and the dataset is well-constructed with realistic variations in geometry and material properties. The inclusion of beading patterns to induce stiffening effects adds complexity and realism to the benchmark. The dataset analysis provides valuable insights into the relationships between geometry and frequency response.
*   **Methodology:** The FQ-Operator is a novel approach that effectively combines operator learning and implicit shape modeling techniques. The query-based approach is well-suited for predicting resonance peaks, a key challenge in frequency response prediction.
*   **Experimental Results:** The experimental results are comprehensive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the FQ-Operator compared to several baseline methods. The ablation studies provide further insights into the importance of different architectural choices. The transfer learning experiments add another layer of evaluation. The sampling efficiency results show the benefits of learning from field solutions.
*   **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is well-written and clearly explains the problem, methodology, and results. The figures and tables are informative and contribute to the overall understanding of the paper. The inclusion of a link to the code and dataset enhances reproducibility.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors have taken concrete steps to ensure reproducibility by providing code and dataset links, detailed architecture information, and hyperparameter settings. The licensing under CC-BY-NC 4.0 promotes further research and usage of the dataset.
*   **Ethics Statement:** The inclusion of an ethics statement is commendable and demonstrates awareness of the broader implications of the research. The discussion on potential limitations and the importance of understanding the reliability of surrogate models is also important.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Geometry Complexity:** While the plate geometry is a good starting point, the benchmark is currently limited to relatively simple shapes. Exploring more complex geometries in future work would increase the applicability of the benchmark. Although this is addressed in the limitations section, it is the most prominent limitation.
*   **Scalability to higher frequency ranges:** Peak density increases in higher frequencies (Figure 4d) potentially making the problem harder. The current evaluation and training is done below 300 Hz. The authors should acknowledge the challenges of scaling this approach to higher frequency ranges, which could involve considerations like more densely sampled field solutions or changes to the model architecture to capture finer details.
*   **Justification of Hyperparameters:** While the training details are given, a more detailed justification of the choice of specific hyperparameters could improve the rigor. For example, why was a cosine learning rate schedule selected, and how was the maximum learning rate determined?
*   **Missing k-NN runtime analysis:** Although runtime of all deep learning methods are provided, there is no mention of the k-NN algorithm, which can get especially slow when working with high-dimensional data.
**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand the Dataset:** Consider expanding the dataset to include more complex geometries, materials, and boundary conditions. This would increase the versatility and impact of the benchmark.
*   **Address Higher Frequencies:** Discuss the challenges associated with predicting frequency responses at higher frequencies and potential solutions.
*   **Provide Further Hyperparameter Justification:** Include a more detailed justification of the choice of specific hyperparameters.
*   **k-NN runtime information:** Add runtime information for k-NN based evaluations.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a valuable contribution to the field of vibroacoustics and scientific machine learning. The creation of a novel benchmark dataset and the development of the FQ-Operator provide a solid foundation for future research in this area. I recommend acceptance of this paper.
