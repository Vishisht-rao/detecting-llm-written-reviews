OUTPUT:
Following Avelar et al. (2018), this paper tackles a crucial and often overlooked aspect of machine learning: the impact of data composition on model performance during data accumulation. The central argument is that simply adding more data, a common practice, can degrade model performance if the composition of the added data is not carefully considered. The paper formalizes this idea through models of data accumulation, provides theoretical analysis, and presents empirical evidence on real-world datasets.

**Strengths:**

*   **Important and Relevant Problem:** The paper addresses a highly relevant problem that is of practical concern to machine learning practitioners. The common belief that "more data is always better" is challenged, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of data scaling.
*   **Clear Problem Formulation:** The paper clearly defines data accumulation and distinguishes between single-source and multi-source settings. The definition of the SEQUENTIAL and MIXTURE cases provides a useful framework for analyzing data accumulation strategies.
*   **Theoretical Grounding:** The paper provides a theoretical analysis, drawing on statistics literature related to sampling bias and f-divergences. This theoretical grounding strengthens the claims and provides intuition for the observed empirical results. Lemma 3.2 is a particularly valuable theoretical contribution.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The paper presents convincing empirical results on three real-world datasets. The experimental setup is well-defined, and the results clearly demonstrate that adding more data can lead to reduced accuracy and fairness on a reference test set in the SEQUENTIAL case. The comparison between the SEQUENTIAL and MIXTURE cases is particularly insightful.
*   **Practical Heuristic:** The proposed heuristic based on excess KL divergence provides a practical way for practitioners to assess the potential benefits or drawbacks of adding more data. The empirical validation of this heuristic is a valuable contribution.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The introduction clearly states the problem, the related work section provides relevant context, and the results are presented in a clear and concise manner.
*   **Focus on Data-Centric Approach:** The paper champions a data-centric perspective, which complements existing model-based approaches to address data limitations. This perspective is important for designing robust and reliable machine learning systems.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Scope of Theoretical Analysis:** While the theoretical analysis provides valuable intuition, it could be further developed. The assumptions underlying Lemma 3.2 could be explored in more detail, and the connection between the divergence-based analysis and the empirical risk could be made more explicit. The paper mentions generalization bounds but doesn't fully explore how those bounds change with increasing training set size in the SEQUENTIAL case.
*   **Simplifications in Data Composition Models:** The SEQUENTIAL and MIXTURE cases, while useful, are simplified representations of real-world data accumulation scenarios. More complex scenarios, involving data pruning, synthetic data, or combinations of the two cases, could be explored in future work.
*   **Choice of Divergence Metric:** The choice of KL divergence as the primary divergence metric could be further justified. Other divergence metrics, such as Wasserstein distance or Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), could also be considered, and a comparison of their performance could be provided.
*   **Limited Discussion of Model Dependency:** The paper acknowledges that the trade-off between data quality and quantity is model-dependent, but this aspect could be explored in more detail. A discussion of which model architectures are more susceptible to the negative effects of data accumulation would be valuable.
*   **Missing Confidence Intervals in Some Results:** Including confidence intervals or standard deviations in the performance figures would enhance the reliability and interpretability of the empirical findings. The paper only explicitly mentions confidence intervals in the appendix for single-source scaling.
*   **Scalability to Larger Models and Datasets:** The paper's focus is primarily on tabular data and small-scale models. It could acknowledge and discuss how the conclusions might change when considering much larger models and datasets, such as those used in large language models and computer vision.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Elaborate on the theoretical analysis:** Provide a more detailed discussion of the assumptions underlying Lemma 3.2 and their implications. Explore the connection between the divergence-based analysis and the empirical risk in more detail.
*   **Consider alternative divergence metrics:** Evaluate the performance of other divergence metrics, such as Wasserstein distance or MMD, and compare them to KL divergence.
*   **Explore model dependency in more detail:** Discuss which model architectures are more susceptible to the negative effects of data accumulation, and provide insights into why this might be the case.
*   **Include confidence intervals or standard deviations in all empirical results.**
*   **Discuss the limitations of the study in terms of scalability to larger models and datasets.**
*   **Add more discussion on practical considerations for mitigating the negative effects of data accumulation. What data curation techniques can be used to improve the quality of the added data?**
*   **Clearly delineate the contributions of this work in the introduction.** While the contributions are listed, highlighting their novelty and impact with respect to existing work could be emphasized further.
*   **Expand on the data preprocessing steps.** A more detailed description of data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering would enhance the reproducibility of the experiments.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that addresses an important and relevant problem in machine learning. The theoretical analysis, empirical validation, and practical heuristic provide valuable insights into the challenges of data accumulation. While there are some areas for improvement, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field and is well-deserving of publication. I lean towards acceptance, contingent on addressing the suggestions for improvement.
