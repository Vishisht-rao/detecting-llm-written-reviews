OUTPUT:
Following Lahr et al. (2015), this paper presents O3D, an offline data-driven framework for improving the sequential decision-making capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) without fine-tuning. The core idea is to leverage offline interaction data to discover reusable skills and distill generalizable knowledge, which is then used to enhance the in-context learning performance of LLM agents. The paper formalizes LLM-powered policies using both text-based and code-based approaches and empirically validates O3D on two interactive decision-making benchmarks: ALFWorld and WebShop.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The proposed O3D framework offers a novel approach to leveraging offline data for enhancing LLM-based agents in sequential decision-making. The idea of skill discovery and knowledge distillation without fine-tuning is appealing, particularly given the cost and accessibility issues associated with fine-tuning large models.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and clearly explains the O3D framework, its components (skill discovery, policy improvement, and downstream interaction), and the differences between the text-based and code-based policy implementations. The figure depicting the framework is also helpful.
*   **Completeness:** The paper discusses implementation details, ablations and baselines, which are essential for reproducibility and understanding of the method's benefits.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The experiments on ALFWorld and WebShop provide strong evidence that O3D can significantly improve the decision-making capabilities of LLMs, consistently outperforming baselines across various LLMs. The results show the applicability on both code and text based policies.
*   **Contribution:** The paper highlights the advantages and disadvantages of both code-based and text-based approaches, which provides valuable insights for future research in this field. Also, the ablation study provides empirical evidence of the importance of the skill discovery, primitive actions and policy improvement tip distillation modules.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Novelty in Skill Discovery:** While the overall framework is novel, the skill discovery component, though shown to be effective, could benefit from a more detailed comparison to existing hierarchical reinforcement learning techniques for option discovery. The paper mentions the analogy to options but doesn't delve into the differences and potential advantages of using LLMs for this purpose.
*   **Offline Data Dependency:** While the paper positions itself as an "offline" learning method, the performance of O3D still relies heavily on the quality and diversity of the offline data. A more detailed analysis of the impact of offline data quality (e.g., varying ratios of expert vs. non-expert data) would be valuable. What is the sensitivity of the method with respect to the training data composition?
*   **Generalizability of "Tips":** The distilled "policy improvement tips" are a crucial element of the framework. The paper could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the types of tips learned, their transferability across different tasks or environments, and the limitations of this approach. Are there types of knowledge that are difficult for the LLM to distill in this way? It is also important to discuss the possible bias from the success trails on policy improvement.
*   **Code-based Policy Limitations:** The paper acknowledges that the code-based policy struggles in WebShop due to the complexity of language understanding. A more thorough discussion of the limitations of code-based approaches in language-rich environments and potential solutions for bridging this gap would be beneficial.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The paper lacks details about how hyperparameters like the number of iterations (T1, T2) and batch sizes (N1, N2) were chosen. A discussion of the sensitivity of the results to these parameters would strengthen the paper.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   Expand the discussion on skill discovery, comparing and contrasting it with existing option discovery methods in hierarchical RL.
*   Provide a more detailed analysis of the impact of offline data quality and diversity on the performance of O3D.
*   Analyze the types of policy improvement tips learned, their transferability, and limitations.
*   Discuss the limitations of code-based policies in language-rich environments and potential solutions.
*   Include details about hyperparameter tuning and sensitivity analysis.
*   In the ablation studies, it would be insightful to include combinations of components rather than just single-component variants to understand the interaction effects among skill discovery, primitive discovery, and tip distillation.

**Overall Recommendation:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach to improving LLM-based agents for sequential decision-making. The O3D framework offers a promising direction for leveraging offline data to enhance in-context learning without fine-tuning. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact. I recommend acceptance, conditional on addressing the above points.
