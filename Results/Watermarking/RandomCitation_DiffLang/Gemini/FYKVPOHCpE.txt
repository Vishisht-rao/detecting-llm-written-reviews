OUTPUT:
Following McGinn et al. (2022), this paper tackles the important and relatively nascent problem of Non-Transferable Learning (NTL). The paper identifies a critical limitation in existing statistical dependence-based NTL methods: their inability to distinguish between content and style, leading to the fitting of spurious correlations and fake independence. The proposed method, H-NTL, addresses this by introducing a causal model to disentangle content and style and using these factors to guide non-transferable representation learning via a dual-path knowledge distillation framework.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Formulation and Motivation:** The paper clearly articulates the NTL problem and provides a compelling argument for why existing methods fail. The illustrative example with the wildlife park and zoo is effective in conveying the core issues. The identification of spurious correlations and fake independence is a key contribution.
*   **Causal Framework:** The introduction of a causal model is a novel and promising approach to NTL. It provides a more principled way to understand and address the limitations of statistical dependence-based methods.
*   **Methodological Novelty:** The H-NTL method, with its variational inference framework for disentanglement and dual-path knowledge distillation, is well-designed and technically sound. The method aligns well with the causal model and aims to learn representations that are both untransferable and minimally detrimental to source domain performance.
*   **Empirical Evaluation:** The paper includes a comprehensive set of experiments across various datasets and settings. The results consistently demonstrate the superiority of H-NTL over competing methods, particularly in challenging scenarios like watermark data and source-only NTL. The ablation studies effectively highlight the importance of both content and style factors. Additional experiments on high-resolution images and IP protection scenarios are also a plus. The additional experiments and analyses including visualization is welcome.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear structure and logical flow. The figures are helpful in illustrating the proposed method.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Training Efficiency:** The paper acknowledges the training inefficiency due to the two-stage training process, but it should delve deeper into potential solutions or optimizations. Are there techniques to streamline the disentanglement process or reduce the computational overhead of the knowledge distillation framework?
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** While the paper analyzes the influence of some hyperparameters (KD weight and number of augmentations), a more comprehensive discussion of hyperparameter tuning and sensitivity analysis would be beneficial. Provide best practices.
*   **Practicality/scalability:** While the paper shows excellent performance, there is a lack of evaluation of the practicality/scalability in real-world scenarios where the number of domains is unknown and dynamically changing.
*   **Domain shift assumptions:** More discussion is necessary on the assumptions required for the source/target domain shifts. For example, if the style factors are almost perfectly correlated to the content, the proposed method will fail.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address Training Efficiency:** Explore and discuss potential techniques to improve the training efficiency of H-NTL. This could involve optimizations to the disentanglement process or the knowledge distillation framework.
*   **Provide Further Hyperparameter Analysis:** Expand the hyperparameter analysis to include a more comprehensive discussion of tuning strategies and sensitivity analysis.
*   **Scalability discussion:** Discuss the scalability of the method for a large number of domains and classes. Is there an efficient way to do domain expansion?
*   **Clarify Assumptions:** State more precisely the assumptions about domain shifts, statistical relationships between content and style.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of Non-Transferable Learning. The proposed H-NTL method is a novel and effective approach to addressing the limitations of existing methods. The paper is well-written, technically sound, and supported by comprehensive empirical evidence. While there are some areas for improvement, this paper is worthy of acceptance at ICLR.
