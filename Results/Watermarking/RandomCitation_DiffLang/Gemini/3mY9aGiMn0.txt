OUTPUT:
Following Motta et al. (2016), this paper presents a novel approach to sparse training called Exact Orthogonal Initialization (EOI). The core idea revolves around generating sparse, orthogonal weight matrices using a composition of random Givens rotations, aiming to improve gradient flow and overall training stability in sparse networks. The paper argues that existing sparse initialization methods often fall short due to either approximating orthogonality or lacking flexibility in sparsity levels. EOI addresses these limitations by providing exact orthogonality and supporting arbitrary sparsity levels for both fully-connected and convolutional layers.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The EOI method itself is a significant contribution. The use of Givens rotations to create sparse orthogonal matrices is a clever approach and appears to be effective. The algorithm is well-motivated, building upon existing research in dynamical isometry and sparse matrix decomposition.
*   **Thorough Evaluation:** The paper provides extensive experimental results on various network architectures (MLPs, CNNs, ResNets, VGG, EfficientNet) and datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, Tiny ImageNet). The experiments cover a range of sparsity levels and density distribution methods. The inclusion of a theoretical analysis regarding the density of Givens products is also a plus.
*   **Strong Results:** The results consistently demonstrate that EOI outperforms other sparse initialization techniques, particularly in high-sparsity regimes and in scenarios where maintaining dynamical isometry is crucial. The ability to train extremely deep (1000-layer) networks without residual connections or normalization highlights the potential of EOI. The additional experimentation related to angle distribution in Givens rotation contributes to the soundness of results.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The introduction clearly outlines the problem and the proposed solution. The related work section provides a good overview of relevant research. The method is explained clearly, and the experiments are well-designed. The paper includes an appendix for additional information and detailed parameters.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Application Scope Demonstrated:** While the paper convincingly demonstrates EOI's effectiveness in image recognition tasks, the lack of experiments in other domains, such as natural language processing (NLP), is a limitation. The authors acknowledge this in the "Limitations and Future Work" section.
*   **Practicality Concerns (Scalability):** While the authors claim EOI is efficient due to the O(n) complexity of Givens rotation multiplication, the scalability of the method to extremely large models (e.g., those used in large language models) is not thoroughly addressed. Although figure 5 illustrates EOI has better scalability than existing solutions, it can be better to mention how this algorithm behaves to larger models or the memory complexity for models such as the tested ResNet architectures.
*   **Some Results Lack Clear Significance:** In some experiments, particularly those involving ResNets and EfficientNet, the improvements achieved by EOI over other methods, while consistent, are relatively small. It's not always clear whether these small gains are practically significant, especially considering the added complexity of implementing EOI.
*   **Clarity in Convolutional Layer Initialization Could be Improved:** The two-step process for creating sparse masks for convolutional layers could be explained more clearly with a visual example demonstrating this step.
*   **Comparison against modern Dynamic sparse methods:** Although comparison against SET and RigL is included, the lack of benchmarks against other modern methods could decrease the results' impact.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Explore NLP Applications:** Conduct experiments on NLP tasks to broaden the applicability of EOI and demonstrate its potential in other domains.
*   **Address Scalability Concerns:** Provide a more detailed analysis of the computational and memory requirements of EOI for very large models. Discuss potential optimizations or approximations to improve scalability.
*   **Further Justify ResNet/EfficientNet Results:** Provide a more in-depth discussion of why the gains from EOI are smaller in ResNets and EfficientNet. Explore potential reasons for this behavior and suggest ways to further improve performance in these architectures.
*   **Clarify Convolutional Layer Initialization:** Add visual aid to better demonstrate the two-step sparse mask for convolutional layers.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach to sparse training. The EOI method is well-motivated, thoroughly evaluated, and consistently demonstrates superior performance compared to existing techniques. The paper's contributions are significant, and it has the potential to advance the field of sparse training. While some limitations and areas for improvement exist, the paper is worthy of acceptance at ICLR 2024.

**Minor Point:** The paper could benefit from a quick proofread as there are some typos, such as "EffcientNet" instead of "EfficientNet."
