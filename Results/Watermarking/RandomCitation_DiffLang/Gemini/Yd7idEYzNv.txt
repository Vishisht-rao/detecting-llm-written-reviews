OUTPUT:
Following Peeler et al. (2024), this paper presents EGALA, a novel approach for large-scale graph adversarial attacks that leverages efficient gradient approximation. The core idea is to approximate the gradient of a linear GNN (SGC) as the inner product of two matrices, enabling the use of Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) to identify edges with significant gradients in sublinear time. The authors claim this results in superior attack capabilities, reduced memory and time consumption, and enhanced scalability compared to existing methods like PRBCD and GRBCD. The paper includes experiments on several datasets and provides comparisons to the state-of-the-art.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The proposed approach of approximating the gradient computation as a matrix product and using ANNS for edge selection is a novel and potentially impactful idea. This allows for efficient exploration of the entire adjacency matrix, addressing the scalability limitations of existing methods.
*   **Scalability:** The paper demonstrates improved scalability compared to PRBCD and GRBCD, particularly on larger datasets like ArXiv and Products, which is a significant contribution.
*   **Experimental Results:** The experimental results generally support the claims of improved performance and efficiency. The paper shows that EGALA often outperforms the baselines in terms of attack success rate while using less time and memory.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and explains the EGALA approach in a clear and concise manner. The use of equations helps to formalize the approach.
*   **Comprehensive Experiments:** The paper includes a comprehensive set of experiments, including comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, ablation studies, and evaluations on different GNN architectures, strengthening the validity of the results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Scope of Gradient Approximation:** The gradient approximation relies heavily on the linearity of the SGC model. The authors acknowledge that generalizing this to other GNN architectures is a future direction, but the current method's applicability is limited to linear GNNs in the surrogate model setting. The success depends strongly on the transferability of the attack from SGC to the target models, which may not always be guaranteed. While the experiments show good transferability to some GNNs, a more theoretical analysis of the conditions under which this transferability holds would be beneficial.
*   **ANNS Overhead:** The experimental results show that EGALA can be slower than the baselines on smaller datasets due to the overhead of ANNS. The paper suggests exploring more efficient ANNS implementations, but this is left for future work. The performance of the clustering-based ANNS should be compared to simpler approaches on smaller graphs where it might be more performant. The choice of K-means as the clustering algorithm could also be improved.
*   **Approximation Analysis:** While the paper provides an empirical evaluation, a more detailed analysis of the approximation error introduced by the matrix product and the degree normalization simplification would be valuable. Understanding the theoretical bounds on this approximation error could help to better understand the limitations of the approach.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** Although the ablation study is presented, it would be good to analyze the hyperparameters of the ANNS further. Is there a principled way to set them, or will it be difficult to tune them for each new setting?
*   **Clarity of ANNS Implementation:** The details of the ANNS implementation are somewhat vague. The paper mentions using Faiss, but doesn't provide a detailed explanation of how the clustering is integrated with Faiss's functionality, making it harder to reproduce the results.
*   **Adaptive Attacks:** The initial evaluation focuses on transfer attacks. Showing how EGALA compares to PRBCD and GRBCD under adaptive settings is important. In the rebuttal, a response to this is provided, but the main paper should include these comparisons.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Discuss limitations more explicitly:** The paper should address the limitations of the gradient approximation and ANNS overhead more explicitly in the main text.
*   **Analyze transferability:** Include a theoretical or empirical analysis of the transferability of attacks from SGC to other GNN architectures.
*   **Provide more ANNS implementation details:** Provide a more detailed explanation of the ANNS implementation, including the choice of clustering algorithm and its integration with Faiss.
*   **Evaluate other ANNS Algorithms:** Consider exploring and evaluating alternative ANNS algorithms, particularly those that are more efficient for smaller datasets.
*   **Adaptive Attack evaluation:** Include the Adaptive attack experiments into the main paper to directly showcase the approach compared to existing methods.
*   **Consider more complex non-linear surrogate models.** Exploring whether the presented approach can be combined with methods that enable scalability of non-linear surrogate models.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a novel and promising approach for large-scale graph adversarial attacks. While there are some limitations, the strengths of the paper, particularly its improved scalability and experimental results, outweigh its weaknesses. With some revisions to address the comments above, this paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field. Therefore, I recommend a `Moderate Accept` with the above suggestions being addressed.
