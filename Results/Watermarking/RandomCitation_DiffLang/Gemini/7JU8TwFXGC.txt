OUTPUT:
Following Toole et al. (2019), this paper presents a novel application of Large Language Models (LLMs) as performance predictors for deep neural network architectures, specifically in the context of neural architecture search (NAS) for machine translation (MT). The authors propose a method to prompt LLMs (LLM-PP) to predict the performance of a given architecture based on its hyperparameters, and then distill this knowledge into a smaller regression model (LLM-Distill-PP) for more efficient use. They demonstrate that LLM-PP can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for performance prediction, while LLM-Distill-PP retains much of this accuracy at a significantly reduced computational cost. Finally, they introduce a hybrid NAS algorithm (HS-NAS) that leverages LLM-Distill-PP for the initial search phase, resulting in a reduction in search time while maintaining or improving performance compared to SOTA NAS methods.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The idea of using LLMs as performance predictors is innovative and offers a fresh perspective on NAS. Exploring the "architecture understanding" capability of LLMs is an interesting research direction.
*   **Empirical Results:** The paper provides solid empirical results, demonstrating the effectiveness of LLM-PP and LLM-Distill-PP on several machine translation benchmarks (WMT’14 En-De, WMT’14 En-Fr, and WMT’19 En-De). The HS-NAS algorithm shows promising results in terms of reducing search time and improving architecture efficiency.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The problem definition, proposed methods, and experimental setup are clearly explained. The prompts used for LLM-PP are well-designed with clear components of role, instructions, hyperparameters, and demonstrations.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors commit to releasing their prompts, data, and code, which is crucial for reproducibility and future research.
*   **Thorough Ablation Studies:** The ablation studies on the different components of the PP prompts provide valuable insights into the importance of each component for LLM-PP's performance.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness Discussion:** The paper realistically addresses the cost implications of using LLM APIs and proposes the distillation approach as a practical solution.
*   **Comprehensive evaluation of HS-NAS:** HS-NAS is evaluated against several benchmarks, different latency constraints and is shown to be robust to initialization seeds.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Kendall-Tau Degradation:** While LLM-PP achieves SOTA MAE, its Kendall-Tau score is marginally worse than the baselines. The paper attempts to justify this by analyzing discordant pairs, but further investigation into the impact of this degradation on NAS performance might be needed. Although Section 7.3 shows that this is not a major factor, more explicit analysis regarding this would be beneficial.
*   **LLM-Distill-PP improvements:** The paper attributes the improvements of LLM-Distill-PP to regularization and context specialization. However, the model is very simple and no ablation study is done to determine if the improvement comes because LLM-PP is noisy or if the distillation process is actually discovering something novel. Some more rigorous experiments should be done to further clarify why LLM-Distill-PP performs so well.
*   **Limited LLM Exploration:** The paper focuses primarily on GPT-4 and ChatGPT. Exploring other LLMs, especially open-source models, could broaden the applicability of the proposed method.
*   **Reliance on Transformer Architectures:** The study focuses solely on Transformer-based encoder-decoder architectures for MT. It would be interesting to explore the generalizability of LLM-PP to other DNN architectures and tasks.
*   **Prompt sensitivity:** It could be valuable to analyze more in depth the sensibility of the LLM to changes in the prompt.
*   **Limited NAS exploration:** The paper uses HAT as the starting point for the hybrid-search. It would be valuable to try and use a different NAS algorithm, or explore different NAS algorithm configuration to determine the best way to take advantage of LLM as a predictor.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Further analysis of Kendall-Tau degradation:** Provide a more detailed analysis of the impact of the lower Kendall-Tau score on the NAS process. Consider experiments that specifically target architectures where the ranking difference between LLM-PP and the baselines is significant.
*   **Broader LLM exploration:** Experiment with other LLMs, including open-source alternatives, to assess the versatility and cost-effectiveness of the proposed approach.
*   **DNN architecture diversity:** Investigate the applicability of LLM-PP to other DNN architectures and tasks beyond machine translation to demonstrate its generalizability.
*   **More exploration of why LLM-Distill-PP improves upon LLM-PP** Run ablation experiments to further clarify why LLM-Distill-PP performs so well.
*   **Prompt experimentation:** Include more details about different LLM prompts that are explored and how they impact performance of the NAS algorithm.

**Overall:**

This is a strong and innovative paper that presents a promising new direction for utilizing LLMs in neural architecture search. The empirical results are compelling, and the proposed LLM-Distill-PP and HS-NAS methods offer practical solutions for cost-effective performance prediction. The paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and the authors' commitment to reproducibility will facilitate further research in this area. The paper is well-suited for acceptance at ICLR 2024.
