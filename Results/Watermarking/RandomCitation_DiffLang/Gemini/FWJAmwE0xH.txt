OUTPUT:
Following McCarron et al. (2021), this paper introduces the Neural-Symbolic Recursive Machine (NSR), a novel framework designed for systematic generalization in sequence-to-sequence tasks. The core idea revolves around a Grounded Symbol System (GSS) that emerges from the training data, enabling the joint learning of perception, syntax, and semantics without explicit domain-specific knowledge. The NSR architecture consists of modular components for neural perception, dependency parsing, and program induction, trained end-to-end using a novel deduction-abduction algorithm. The paper argues that the inductive biases of equivariance and compositionality, inherent in the NSR design, contribute to its superior generalization capabilities.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Approach:** The NSR presents a compelling approach to systematic generalization by integrating neural and symbolic reasoning in a modular and trainable manner. The concept of learning a GSS from data is interesting and potentially impactful.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The paper demonstrates significant improvements over existing models on several challenging benchmarks, including SCAN, PCFG, and HINT. Achieving 100% accuracy on SCAN and PCFG, and a substantial gain on HINT, provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of the NSR framework. The results on the compositional machine translation task further highlight the potential for real-world applicability.
*   **Clear and Well-Structured:** The paper is generally well-written and structured. The introduction clearly outlines the problem and the proposed solution. The model description, learning algorithm, and experimental setup are explained in sufficient detail.
*   **Theoretical Justification:** The paper provides a theoretical justification for the expressiveness of the NSR and highlights the importance of equivariance and compositionality for systematic generalization. The theorem and hypothesis are well-stated and provide a solid foundation for the empirical findings.
*   **Thorough Experimental Evaluation:** The evaluation protocols are well-defined, and the comparisons with relevant baselines are comprehensive. The ablation study on HINT sheds light on the contribution of each module to the overall performance.
*   **Deduction-Abduction Algorithm:** The deduction-abduction algorithm is a clever approach for training the NSR without explicit supervision for the GSS. The description of the algorithm and its analogy to a Metropolis-Hastings sampler are well-presented.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity on Deduction-Abduction:** While the deduction-abduction algorithm is described, some aspects could be clarified further. For example, the priority function used in the search is not explicitly defined, making it difficult to fully understand the search strategy. The interaction between abduction and the individual module's training in the `learn` function (Alg. A1, Line 8) could also be expanded on. What type of loss is being used and how are the gradients being backpropagated through this system?
*   **Computational Cost:** The paper briefly mentions compute resources but doesn't provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost of training the NSR. Specifically, the deduction-abduction algorithm, with its search-based refinement of the GSS, could be computationally expensive. A comparison of training time and resource requirements with existing models would be beneficial.
*   **Limitations in Real-World Applications:** The paper acknowledges limitations in applying NSR to real-world machine translation due to noisy concepts and probabilistic semantics. While this is a valid point, the discussion is relatively brief. Further elaborating on potential solutions for these challenges would strengthen the paper.
*   **NeSS comparison on PCFG and HINT:** While the authors state NeSS encounters "total failure" on the PCFG dataset and has comparatively lower results on HINT, these results may need further scrutiny. Are the parameters and search methodologies properly optimized for these different datasets? Are the primitives adequate for PCFG, as the authors suggest, and what is the implication of modifying them? Perhaps an appendix detailing the limitations when extending NeSS to these environments could be included.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Provide more details on the priority function used in the deduction-abduction algorithm.**
*   **Include a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of training the NSR, comparing it to existing models.**
*   **Further elaborate on potential solutions for addressing the limitations of NSR in real-world applications.**
*   **Explore and describe in more detail the parameters and limitations of applying NeSS to PCFG and HINT.**
*   **Improve clarity regarding training between the Abduction stage and Neural Perception, Dependency Parsing, and Program Induction.**

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that introduces a novel and effective approach to systematic generalization. The NSR framework, with its learned GSS and deduction-abduction algorithm, represents a significant contribution to the field. The strong empirical results and theoretical justifications support the claims made in the paper. Addressing the minor weaknesses outlined above would further enhance the impact and clarity of the work. I recommend this paper for acceptance, pending minor revisions.
