OUTPUT:
Following Garrard et al. (2020), this paper introduces Lp-convolution, a novel convolutional layer designed to bridge the gap between artificial and biological receptive fields (RFs). The core idea is to leverage the multivariate p-generalized normal distribution (MPND) to model RF shapes, offering flexibility in distortion, scale, and rotation. The authors hypothesize that incorporating biologically plausible RFs can enhance model performance and improve alignment with brain representations.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The Lp-convolution is a novel approach that combines insights from neuroscience and machine learning. Using the MPND to model and adapt RF shapes is an interesting idea.
*   **Clarity of Problem Statement:** The paper clearly articulates the disparity between CNN RFs and biological RFs, motivating the proposed solution.
*   **Strong Experimental Results:** The paper presents compelling results in several areas:
    *   **Sudoku:** The Sudoku experiment effectively demonstrates the conformational adaptability of Lp-masks and their ability to balance accuracy across different aspects of the task. The ablation study on orientation-selective masks further supports this.
    *   **Vision Classification:** The performance gains observed in various CNN architectures (AlexNet, VGG-16, ResNet-18/34, ConvNeXt-T) on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, particularly with pinit=2, are significant.
    *   **Representational Similarity Analysis:** The RSA results provide evidence that Lp-CNNs can achieve better alignment with the visual cortex.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the methods and experiments. The figures are informative and contribute to the overall understanding.
*   **Reproducibility:** The availability of code, datasets, and pre-trained models is a major strength, promoting reproducibility and further research.
* **Impact on multiple CNN architecture:** The Lp-conv can be implemented in different types of CNNs, as shown in the results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Justification of MPND Choice:** While the paper introduces MPND, a deeper justification for its specific selection compared to other potential distributions for modeling RFs would be beneficial. A discussion of the mathematical properties of MPND that make it particularly suitable for this task could strengthen the paper.
*   **Biological Realism:** While the paper aims for biological plausibility, the connection to specific biological mechanisms could be strengthened. Further discussion on *why* pinit=2 performs best, relating it back to biological properties of V1 RFs, would be valuable. For instance, how does the learned scale, rotation, and distortion relate to tuning properties observed in the visual cortex?
*   **Computational Cost:** The paper doesn't explicitly address the computational cost of Lp-convolution compared to standard convolution. Training with trainable masks could increase computational overhead, and this should be discussed.
*   **Generalization of RSA:** The RSA is performed on mouse visual cortex and TinyImageNet-trained networks. While this is valuable, it would be useful to discuss the potential for generalization to human visual cortex and models trained on larger datasets. Are there limitations to this approach?
*   **Ablation studies on vision classification:** More ablation studies can be done on the vision classification task. For example, ablating only the vertical edges may lead to further analysis of the mechanism.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand the Justification for MPND:** Provide a more detailed explanation of why MPND is a suitable choice for modeling RF shapes.
*   **Strengthen the Link to Biological Realism:** Elaborate on the biological implications of the learned parameters (scale, rotation, distortion) and provide further justification for the observed performance gains with pinit=2.
*   **Address Computational Cost:** Include a discussion of the computational complexity of Lp-convolution compared to standard convolution. Provide empirical measurements of training time and memory usage.
*   **Discuss Generalization of RSA:** Discuss the potential limitations of the RSA and its ability to generalize to human visual cortex and models trained on larger datasets.
*   **Further Ablation Studies:** Consider performing more ablation studies to analyze how different properties affect the final performance.

**Overall:**

This is a well-executed and promising paper that introduces a novel approach to convolutional neural networks. The Lp-convolution has the potential to improve both performance and biological plausibility, opening up interesting avenues for future research. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact.

I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
