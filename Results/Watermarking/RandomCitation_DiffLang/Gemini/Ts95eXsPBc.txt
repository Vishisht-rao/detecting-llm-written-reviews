OUTPUT:
Following Hamer et al. (2016), this paper presents a novel and interesting approach to incorporating spatial information into transformer-based episodic memory for embodied agents. The core idea of the Spatially-Aware Transformer (SAT) is well-motivated, addressing a clear gap in existing transformer architectures which primarily focus on temporal order and often neglect the spatial context crucial for many embodied agent tasks. The paper proposes a series of SAT models, including SAT-FIFO, SAT-PM (Place Memory), and SAT with Adaptive Memory Allocator (AMA), progressively adding complexity and sophistication.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The paper introduces a genuinely novel concept. The idea of making transformers spatially aware is a valuable contribution to the field. The work clearly articulates the limitations of current transformer architectures in spatial reasoning tasks and offers a tangible solution.
*   **Well-Motivated:** The authors effectively draw upon cognitive science research to highlight the importance of spatial context in episodic memory, providing a solid theoretical foundation for their approach. The thought experiments in Figure 1 are helpful in illustrating the limitations of FIFO-based memory and the potential benefits of spatial awareness.
*   **Comprehensive Approach:** The paper explores various design choices within the SAT framework, ranging from simple spatial embeddings to more sophisticated place-centric hierarchical memory and adaptive memory allocation. This allows for a thorough evaluation of the benefits and drawbacks of different approaches.
*   **Extensive Experiments:** The paper presents a wide range of experiments across diverse environments and downstream tasks, including prediction, generation, reasoning, and reinforcement learning. The experiments are well-designed and provide convincing evidence for the advantages of the proposed SAT models, particularly SAT-PM and SAT-AMA. The ablation studies, such as the comparison of time-centric vs. place-centric hierarchical reading, offer valuable insights.
*   **Adaptive Memory Allocator (AMA):** The AMA method is a significant contribution. The balance between flexibility and ease of training it offers is well-reasoned and practically useful. The demonstration of its ability to generalize to multi-task descriptions (SAT-AMA-Lang) is particularly compelling.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors commit to releasing the source code and provide pseudo-code, model architectures, and hyperparameters in the appendix, enhancing the reproducibility of their work. The detailed descriptions of the tasks and experimental setups are also helpful.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Reliance on Spatial Annotation:** The paper's reliance on explicit spatial annotation is a significant limitation. While the authors acknowledge this in the limitations section, it restricts the applicability of the approach to environments where spatial information is readily available. A future direction should focus on integrating spatial representation learning alongside the use of spatial information.
*   **Generality of AMA:** While AMA is a valuable contribution, its generality is limited by the predefined set of memory management strategies. The authors acknowledge that a more ideal approach would be to discover the strategy from scratch, but they also rightly point out the practical challenges associated with such an approach. More discussion could be added about how researchers can design a useful 'A' (set of memory management strategies).
*   **Complexity of Environments:** While the experiments cover a variety of environments, some are relatively simple (e.g., Room Ballet). Expanding the experiments to more complex and realistic 3D environments could further strengthen the paper. The Habitat environment results are a good first step, but more detailed analysis would be beneficial.
*   **DNC Comparison:** The DNC comparison lacks sufficient analysis. More training steps and hyperparameter tuning might produce better results for DNC and better elucidate differences between it and AMA.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address the Spatial Annotation Limitation:** Discuss potential approaches for learning spatial representations from raw sensory input, even if it's just a conceptual outline.
*   **Expand AMA Strategy Design:** Provide guidance on designing effective memory management strategies for the AMA. What factors should be considered when creating the set 'A'?
*   **Enhance Habitat Experiments:** Provide more details and analysis of the Habitat experiments. A more visually clear diagram of the habitat environment could be beneficial.
*   **DNC Comparison:** Consider investing more resources in tuning and training the DNC model or focusing the comparison more on a specific aspect that highlights the strengths of AMA (e.g., scalability, sample efficiency).

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that introduces a novel and well-motivated approach to improving transformer-based episodic memory for embodied agents. The experiments provide convincing evidence for the benefits of the proposed Spatially-Aware Transformer models, particularly the SAT-PM and SAT-AMA. The paper has some limitations, primarily related to the reliance on spatial annotation and the generality of AMA, but these limitations are acknowledged and provide clear directions for future research. The strengths of the paper significantly outweigh its weaknesses, making it a valuable contribution to the field. The paper is well-written, easy to follow, and technically sound. I recommend acceptance.
