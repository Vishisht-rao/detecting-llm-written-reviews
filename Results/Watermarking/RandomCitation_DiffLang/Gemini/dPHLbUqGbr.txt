OUTPUT:
Following Starr et al. (2024), this paper presents a novel approach for constructing SE(n)-equivariant neural networks, emphasizing efficiency and expressiveness. The core contribution lies in formalizing weight sharing in message passing networks based on equivalence classes of point pairs and deriving optimal invariant attributes for these classes, based on homogeneous space theory. The paper introduces PΘNITA, a fast, expressive equivariant architecture built primarily on convolutions, operating in position-orientation space (R3×S2). The paper showcases state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks, including interatomic potential energy prediction, trajectory forecasting in N-body systems, and molecule generation using equivariant diffusion models, demonstrating both accuracy and speed.

**Strengths:**

*   **Theoretical Foundation:** The paper provides a solid theoretical grounding for weight sharing in SE(n)-equivariant networks, using homogeneous spaces and quotient spaces. The formalization of weight sharing (Definitions 3.1-3.3) and the derivation of optimal attributes (Theorem 1) are significant contributions.
*   **Clarity of Problem Statement:** The paper clearly articulates the problem of finding invariant attributes and the criteria they must satisfy (invariance and uniqueness).
*   **Practical Applicability:** The derived attributes are not just theoretical constructs; they are used to build a practical and efficient equivariant architecture.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art or competitive performance on several challenging benchmarks, with improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods like NequIP and SEGNN. The detailed experimental section provides a strong validation of the approach.
*   **Novelty:** The idea of leveraging the homogeneous space R3×S2 for efficient computation and directional information capture is well-motivated and effectively implemented. The separable group convolution in position-orientation space (Section 3.2) is a key innovation.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it relatively easy to follow the theoretical development and the experimental results.
*   **Reproducibility:** The code availability enhances the reproducibility of the results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Complexity:** While the paper is generally well-written, the underlying mathematical concepts can be challenging for readers not familiar with group theory and homogeneous spaces. A more intuitive explanation of these concepts could broaden the paper's appeal.
*   **Discretization Artifacts:** The paper acknowledges that using discrete grids over the sphere in the regular group convolution approach introduces numerical errors in equivariance. Although experiments indicate these errors don't drastically affect the performance, further analysis on the impact of grid density on equivariance and performance would strengthen the paper.
*   **Ablation Studies:** While the paper compares PΘNITA to a baseline PNITA variant, more comprehensive ablation studies exploring the impact of different architectural choices (e.g., number of layers, hidden dimension size, attribute embedding methods) would provide deeper insights into the method's performance.
*   **Clarity on "Optimal" Attributes:** While the paper claims to derive "optimal" attributes, it could be more explicit about what criteria define optimality. It touches upon expressivity, but elaborating on why other possible invariant attributes were not chosen, and what makes these derived ones specifically better, would reinforce this claim.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Intuitive Explanations:** Include more intuitive explanations and examples of the mathematical concepts, particularly for homogeneous spaces, quotient spaces, and group actions.
*   **Equivariance Analysis:** Expand the discussion on the impact of discretization on equivariance, potentially with quantitative analysis or visualizations.
*   **More Ablation Studies:** Include more ablation studies to analyze the impact of different architectural choices and hyperparameter settings.
*   **Justification of "Optimality":** Provide a more detailed justification for the claim that the derived attributes are "optimal," clarifying the criteria used to assess optimality.
*   **Broader Comparison to Other Methods:** In the experimental section, adding comparisons with other relevant methods, even if only in terms of accuracy or speed, would provide a broader context for the paper's contributions.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes significant contributions to the field of equivariant neural networks. The theoretical grounding, practical applicability, and strong empirical results make it a valuable addition to the literature. While some aspects could be improved, the paper is well-deserving of acceptance.
