OUTPUT:
Following Domingo et al. (2019), this paper tackles an important problem: understanding the trade-offs between fairness and accuracy in machine learning models, particularly when data access is restricted. The authors propose a framework to analyze this trade-off under four different data-restricting scenarios and various fairness definitions. The core idea of analyzing the joint distribution (X, A, Y) and using a Bayesian oracle constrained by fairness definitions is interesting and potentially valuable. The paper is well-structured and clearly outlines the problem, the proposed framework, and the experimental results. However, there are several areas that need improvement before this paper is ready for publication.

**Strengths:**

*   **Relevant Problem:** The paper addresses a crucial issue in responsible AI development â€“ balancing fairness and accuracy, especially under realistic data constraints.
*   **Clear Structure:** The paper is well-organized, with a clear introduction, related work section, description of the framework, experimental results, and conclusion.
*   **Novel Approach:** Directly analyzing the joint distribution (X, A, Y) and formulating the problem as a constrained convex optimization is a novel approach. This differs from much of the existing work that focuses on pre/in/post-processing techniques on a scoring function.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper considers multiple fairness definitions (group and individual) and conducts experiments on three datasets.
*   **Thoroughness:** The supplementary material pointed to within the document (though inaccessible to the reviewer) suggests a strong attention to detail and a genuine attempt at completeness.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Lack of Clarity in Methodology:** While the overall approach is understandable, the specific details of the framework, especially the discrete approximation using vector quantization and the generator network, are vague. The explanation in Section 3 is not sufficiently detailed for reproducibility. The connection between densely sampling the generator and faithfully constructing a fine-grained discrete approximation isn't clear. More explanation of how the generator is trained and its architecture is necessary.
*   **Overly Complex Notation:** The notation used in Section 3 is dense and potentially confusing. While the authors attempt to consolidate notation, it makes the optimization problem difficult to parse and understand. A clearer and more intuitive explanation of the variables and the optimization constraints is required. The use of boldface is inconsistent and confusing. Also, including a table of symbols at the beginning of Section 3 would be helpful.
*   **Limited Justification of Design Choices:** The paper doesn't adequately justify several key design choices. For example, why is the Bayesian oracle chosen as the baseline? Why is a deviation vector *m* used instead of directly optimizing *sF*? Why is vector quantization used for the discrete approximation? What distance metric is used for individual fairness? These choices should be explicitly justified.
*   **Missing Algorithmic Details:** The paper mentions solving the convex optimization problem using linear programming but doesn't provide specific details about the implementation or the solver used. Similarly, the algorithm for solving the Augmented Lagrangian is only briefly mentioned, lacking crucial details like the stopping criteria and parameter settings.
*   **Limited Discussion on the Effect of VQ:** The vector quantization step introduces a loss of information. How does the granularity of the VQ cells (number of cells Nc) affect the accuracy and fairness trade-offs? A discussion of this is missing.
*   **Unclear Significance of Decorrelation Results:** While the paper shows that decorrelation can be achieved with a small accuracy drop, the practical significance of this result is unclear. What are the benefits of using decorrelated features in a real-world scenario? Under what conditions is it preferable to use the original features with fairness constraints?
*   **Lack of Error Analysis:** The paper focuses on average accuracy reduction but doesn't provide any insights into which instances or groups suffer the most from fairness constraints and decorrelation. A more detailed error analysis would be valuable.
*   **Missing Appendix Items:** Many parts of the paper depend on the appendices. (See Appendix B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M.) However, the appendices are not present with the paper. As such, many key details about the paper cannot be evaluated.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Provide more details on the framework:** Expand Section 3 with a clearer and more detailed explanation of the discrete approximation, the generator network, the Bayesian oracle, and the optimization problems. Include pseudocode or algorithms to improve clarity.
*   **Simplify the notation:** Revise the notation to be more intuitive and less dense. Use consistent notation throughout the paper.
*   **Justify design choices:** Provide clear justifications for all key design choices, including the choice of the Bayesian oracle, the deviation vector *m*, the vector quantization method, and the distance metric for individual fairness.
*   **Include algorithmic details:** Provide more details about the linear programming solver and the Augmented Lagrangian algorithm, including parameter settings and stopping criteria.
*   **Discuss the effect of VQ:** Analyze the impact of the number of VQ cells (Nc) on the accuracy and fairness trade-offs.
*   **Clarify the significance of decorrelation results:** Provide a more in-depth discussion of the practical benefits and limitations of using decorrelated features.
*   **Conduct error analysis:** Analyze which instances or groups are most affected by fairness constraints and decorrelation.
*   **Include all the appendices:** The current version of the paper is unreadable without the information in the appendices.

**Overall:**

This paper presents an interesting and potentially valuable contribution to the field of fair machine learning. However, the current version is difficult to understand due to the lack of clarity in the methodology, the overly complex notation, and the missing algorithmic details. Addressing the weaknesses listed above would significantly improve the quality of the paper and make it suitable for publication.
