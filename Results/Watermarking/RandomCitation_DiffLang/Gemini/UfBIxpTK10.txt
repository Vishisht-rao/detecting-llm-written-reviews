OUTPUT:
Following Bourque et al. (2014), this paper addresses a critical challenge in the field of molecular docking: the poor generalization ability of existing machine learning-based methods when applied to novel protein families. The authors convincingly argue that current benchmarks, primarily relying on PDBBind, fail to adequately assess generalization due to the evolutionary conservation of binding pockets, leading to high similarity between training and test sets despite low overall sequence identity.

The introduction of DOCKGEN, a new benchmark built upon ECOD domain classifications and the Binding MOAD dataset, is a significant contribution. This benchmark provides a more rigorous assessment of docking methods' ability to generalize across the proteome. The authors demonstrate that existing ML-based docking methods, including the current state-of-the-art DIFFDOCK, perform significantly worse on DOCKGEN compared to PDBBind, highlighting the generalization gap.

The scaling analysis of DIFFDOCK with respect to data and model size is insightful. The authors show that increasing both factors improves generalization, further enhanced by a novel van der Mer-inspired data augmentation strategy. This leads to the development of DIFFDOCK-L, a new state-of-the-art method on both DOCKGEN and PDBBind. The public release of DIFFDOCK-L is a welcome contribution to the community.

The core innovation of the paper lies in the introduction of CONFIDENCE BOOTSTRAPPING, a novel self-training scheme. This method cleverly leverages the multi-resolution nature of diffusion models, using feedback from a confidence model to refine the early stages of the reverse diffusion process, guiding the model towards high-confidence poses even in unseen protein domains. The analogy to Monte Carlo tree search and the connection to reinforcement learning are well-articulated and provide a strong theoretical foundation.

The experimental results supporting CONFIDENCE BOOTSTRAPPING are compelling. The authors demonstrate a significant improvement in docking accuracy on the DOCKGEN benchmark, particularly within protein domain clusters where the initial performance was already reasonable. The ablation studies further validate the importance of different components of the method. The analysis of individual cluster performance provides valuable insights into the limitations of the current approach and suggests directions for future research, particularly in improving the confidence model.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses a critical problem:** Generalization in molecular docking is a significant bottleneck for drug discovery and biological research.
*   **Novel benchmark (DOCKGEN):** Provides a more rigorous evaluation of generalization ability.
*   **Insightful scaling analysis:** Demonstrates the impact of data and model size on generalization.
*   **Innovative method (CONFIDENCE BOOTSTRAPPING):** Effectively leverages the structure of diffusion models for self-training.
*   **Strong experimental results:** Supports the effectiveness of CONFIDENCE BOOTSTRAPPING.
*   **Well-written and clearly articulated:** The paper is easy to follow and the technical details are well-explained.
*   **Public release of resources:** Makes the research more accessible and reproducible.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Reliance on a pretrained confidence model:** The performance of CONFIDENCE BOOTSTRAPPING is inherently dependent on the quality of the confidence model. While the paper addresses this, future work could explore training the confidence model jointly or iteratively with the diffusion model.
*   **Limited number of clusters used for CONFIDENCE BOOTSTRAPPING experiments:** While the results are promising, testing on a larger and more diverse set of protein domain clusters would further strengthen the conclusions.
*   **Runtime cost of fine-tuning:** While the authors discuss the amortization of fine-tuning costs in screening campaigns, the initial computational burden may be a barrier to entry for some researchers.

**Overall:**

This is a strong and impactful paper that makes significant contributions to the field of molecular docking. The introduction of DOCKGEN, the scaling analysis, and the development of CONFIDENCE BOOTSTRAPPING represent important advances. The paper is well-written, the experiments are well-designed, and the results are compelling. The weaknesses are relatively minor and do not detract from the overall significance of the work. This paper is highly deserving of acceptance.
