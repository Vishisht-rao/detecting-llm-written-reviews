OUTPUT:
Following London et al. (2023), this article presents a comprehensive and theoretically grounded approach to sampling from unnormalized densities utilizing a novel smoothing framework. The authors effectively build upon prior techniques, most notably their previous work on walk-jump sampling, and introduce a mechanism that employs an isotropic Gaussian kernel with a fixed noise scale. Their framework manages to delineate unnormalized density sampling as a sequence of conditional sampling from log-concave densities, reflecting an impressive breadth of theoretical rigor.

### Strengths:
1. **Theoretical Contribution**: The authors provide a general result establishing that, under their framework, the problem of sampling in \( \mathbb{R}^d \) can be transformed into a series of sampling tasks from strongly log-concave densities. This result significantly broadens the toolkit available for dealing with high-dimensional spaces, where traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods often struggle.

2. **Innovative Algorithm Design**: The proposed algorithm, which incorporates a non-Markovian component via a running empirical mean, strikes a balance between maintaining a lightweight computational cost and enhancing sampling efficiency. This design choice could prove advantageous in practical applications where memory usage is a concern.

3. **Performance Evaluation**: The paper presents thorough empirical evaluations demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed sampling scheme against existing Langevin MCMC approaches. The results illustrate a marked improvement in the ability to traverse high-dimensional spaces, confirming the authors' assertions about the tunneling capability of their algorithm.

4. **Clear Structure and Flow**: The manuscript is well-structured, guiding readers through the development of theoretical results to algorithm implementation and empirical validation. The inclusion of sections that explicitly summarize contributions (e.g., in the introduction) aids reader comprehension.

### Weaknesses:
1. **Complexity of Notation**: While the theoretical aspects are fascinating, the notation can at times be cumbersome, particularly for those not deeply familiar with multimeasurement frameworks. A more accessible introduction to the notation used could facilitate a smoother transition into the core content.

2. **Missing Optimality Assessment**: The limitations mentioned concerning the lack of clarity on the optimality of the proposed sampling strategy constitute a significant acknowledgment. Further exploration of the optimal settings, comparative analyses with existing methods regarding performance bounds, and perhaps an exploration of how the parameters affect the efficiency of the algorithm could enrich the work.

3. **Denoising Framework**: There is a premature assumption that the smoothed score function \( g(y; \sigma) \) is readily obtainable. The requirement for efficient estimation or approximation of this score function introduces a layer of complexity, particularly for practical implementations. Future work providing a more straightforward solution or heuristic for estimating \( g \) could be beneficial.

4. **Generative Modeling Implications**: The potential "generative modeling" applications hinted at the end of the paper are intriguing but not sufficiently fleshed out. A stronger discussion or example demonstrating this relationship could yield valuable insights for the machine learning community.

### Conclusion:
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of unnormalized density sampling, showcasing a well-thought-out theoretical framework complemented by empirical evidence of its effectiveness. With slight refinements in notation and a deeper dive into application implications, this work stands to impact various domains where effective high-dimensional sampling is crucial. The paper is well-positioned for acceptance at ICLR 2024, contributing valuable insights to the ongoing discourse on sampling techniques in machine learning.
