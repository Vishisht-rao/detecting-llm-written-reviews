**Review of “Learning Causal Dynamics Models in Object-Oriented Environments”**

Following Meehan et al. (2019), this article presents a significant advancement in the integration of causal discovery and dynamics modeling within reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks, specifically targeting large-scale object-oriented environments. The authors introduce the Object-Oriented Causal Dynamics Model (OOCDM), which capitalizes on the structural simplicity afforded by object-oriented programming to manage causal relationships and improve computational efficiency.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach**: The OOCDM presents an original approach by combining causal dynamics models with object-oriented representations. This allows for effective sharing of causalities and parameters among objects of the same class, addressing scalability in dealing with large numbers of objects.

2. **Theoretical Foundations**: The paper provides robust theoretical justifications for the proposed model, complemented by sound mathematical definitions and theorems outlining the causal relationships and their efficiencies in both the causal discovery process and the dynamics model learning.

3. **Empirical Validation**: The experimental results are compelling, demonstrating OOCDM's superiority over existing causal dynamics models (CDMs) in metrics such as causal discovery accuracy, prediction accuracy, and computational efficiency, particularly in complex, large-scale tasks.

4. **Future Applications**: The OOCDM framework promises broad applicability across various settings in RL, providing a foundation for further exploration of object-oriented representations in complex environments. 

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Domain Knowledge Requirement**: The paper acknowledges that effective OO modeling requires domain specific knowledge to appropriately define the environments as Object-Oriented Markov Decision Processes (OOMDPs). This reliance on expertise may limit the model's applicability to practitioners who may lack in-depth understanding of the domain-specific intricacies.

2. **Symmetry Limitations**: The results depend heavily on maintaining result symmetry and causation symmetry. While the authors propose methods to ensure these conditions, they may not always hold true in real-world scenarios, particularly with confounding factors or non-Markovian dynamics.

3. **Limited Exploration of Asymmetry**: Although the authors address how OOCDM adapts to asymmetric environments by introducing identity attributes, the implications of these adjustments require deeper exploration. The current approach might still overlook more complex interrelations that could be better captured by alternative representations.

**Future Work Recommendations:**

- **Exploration of Object-Centric Learning**: The authors should consider mechanisms for automatically identifying and categorizing objects from raw observations, potentially making the OO modeling more accessible to users unfamiliar with the intricacies of object-oriented design.
  
- **Broader Empirical Testing**: Future studies could evaluate the OOCDM in a wider range of environments, particularly those with robust confounders or dynamic properties that break symmetry. This would help to assess its resilience and applicability across varied real-world scenarios.

- **Integration with Advanced Causal Frameworks**: Investigating how OOCDMs can integrate with complex causal frameworks that deal with confounding variables, partial observability, or unmodeled dynamics could significantly extend the current findings and enhance the model's applicability.

Overall, this paper makes a substantial contribution to the fields of causal inference and reinforcement learning, providing a clear direction for future research and practical applications in dynamic environments. The introduction of object-oriented principles into causal dynamics modeling is a laudable step forward that has the potential to influence both academic and applied domains. I recommend acceptance of this paper with the possibility of minor revisions to improve its clarity and expand on the identified weaknesses.
