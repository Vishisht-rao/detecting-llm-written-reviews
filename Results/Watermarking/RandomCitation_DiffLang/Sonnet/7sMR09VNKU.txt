OUTPUT:
Following Chaffin et al. (2024), this paper presents a comprehensive approach to learning system dynamics from sensory input under optimal control principles. The authors draw on Koopman operator theory to framework the embedding of states and controls into a feature space where the dynamics are linear. This approach cleverly incorporates the control task into the learning objective, which addresses the common issue of decoupled dynamics learning from control tasks in prior literature. Below are my detailed comments and evaluation based on key sections of the paper.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Framework**: The authors propose a novel method to jointly learn representation and control tasks by embedding both the sensory inputs and controls into a higher-dimensional space, thus enabling effective control of complicated dynamics. The inclusion of control objectives in the learning objective marks a significant advancement over existing methodologies.

2. **Robust Experimental Validation**: The experiments conducted on classical control problems (pendulum and cartpole) effectively validate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed approach. The performance metrics, which show improved control accuracy and success rates compared to previous methods, support the effectiveness of the joint learning paradigm.

3. **Detailed Theoretical Foundation**: The paper thoroughly discusses the theoretical basis, drawing from established concepts in control theory and data-driven modeling. The incorporation of differentiable optimization techniques is particularly noteworthy, bridging an important gap between model learning and control.

4. **Clarity of Presentation**: The structure of the paper is logical and well-organized. The problem statement, methodology, and experimental results are clearly articulated, making the paper accessible to readers familiar with the subject matter.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Dependency on Optimal Trajectories**: One significant limitation identified by the authors is the requirement for optimal trajectories during training, which is a prerequisite that might hinder the method's application in scenarios where such data is unavailable. Future work should explore techniques for relaxing this requirement.

2. **Computational Complexity**: The paper mentions that the approach may become computationally demanding for higher-dimensional systems as the complexity of the LQR solver scales cubically with respect to the encoding space dimension. A deeper discussion on how to manage or mitigate this issue in practical applications would be beneficial.

3. **Experimental Scope**: While the paper successfully demonstrates its approach on standard control problems, it would benefit from exploring its applicability to more complex, real-world systems beyond the two analyzed. This would provide further insight into the versatility and robustness of the method.

4. **Loss Function Scaling**: The empirical risk minimization approach involves adding scaling coefficients to account for different scales in the training loss, which might require further justification. A more robust handling of the loss components could strengthen the evaluation.

**Overall Evaluation:**
This paper provides a significant contribution to the fields of control theory and robotic learning. Its methodological advancements leveraging Koopman operator theory for effective control from visual sensors hold promise for a wide range of applications in robotics and beyond. While there are limitations, the strengths and contributions of this work clearly outweigh them, making it a valuable addition to the literature.

**Recommendation**: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should address the identified weaknesses, particularly regarding the dependency on optimal trajectories, computational efficiency, and the experimental scope of the results.
