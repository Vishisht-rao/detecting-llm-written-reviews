OUTPUT:
Following Woolley et al. (2021), this paper presents a timely and insightful investigation into the question awareness capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and introduces a novel method, Question Awareness Temperature (QAT) sampling, to enhance this ability. The exploration of whether LLMs can differentiate between open-ended and non-open-ended questions is significant, given the growing reliance on these models for various applications in natural language processing and generation.

### Strengths:

1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The concept of question awareness in LLMs is relatively underexplored. By proposing QAT sampling, the authors address an important challenge whereby LLMs may struggle with providing appropriate responses based on the nature of the inquiry, namely that determinate questions require more accurate responses while creative questions allow for variability. This contribution to the field is both substantial and timely.

2. **Thorough Experimental Design**: The paper outlines a well-structured methodology for evaluating question awareness, utilizing a range of question types and employing kurtosis as a metric for response determinacy. The findings are framed with respect to both open-ended and non-open-ended questions, which adequately underscores the various domains of language use in which LLMs may falter.

3. **Adaptation of Temperature Sampling**: The QAT sampling method is a notable advancement, enabling LLMs to dynamically adjust their responses according to question types without manual tuning. The dual-phase training involving continual fine-tuning followed by inference demonstrates a thoughtful approach to model enhancement, which aligns with current practices in AI development.

4. **Empirical Validation**: The use of comparative analysis against existing baseline models without QAT sampling strengthens the claims made regarding the efficacy of the proposed method. Performance improvements across various LLM benchmarks considerably support the effectiveness of QAT sampling.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Limited Scope of Models**: The evaluation is conducted on Llama 2 and Falcon models but does not include other potentially relevant models like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4, due to access limitations. While the chosen models provide valuable insights, a comparative analysis with a wider range of LLMs would bolster the findings and applicability of the results across the landscape of contemporary language models.

2. **Need for Theoretical Underpinnings**: While the results are promising, additional theoretical underpinnings or justifications for why QAT improves determinacy would strengthen the paper. The rationale behind the choice of various hyperparameters in the QAT sampling method, as well as their empirical effects, could be detailed more extensively.

3. **Question Awareness Limitations**: The authors highlight the shortcomings of LLMs regarding specific types of questions. Further discussion on the implications of these limitations, including potential avenues for future research or how they might impact real-world applications, would clarify the significance of these findings beyond the experimental context.

### Conclusion:

Overall, the paper offers a compelling examination of question awareness in LLMs and presents a meaningful contribution through the introduction of QAT sampling. The methodological rigor and empirical findings provide a solid foundation for future research in enhancing LLM responsiveness to varied inquiries. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in expanding the scope of the models evaluated and deepening the theoretical discussion, this paper stands to significantly impact the ongoing discourse on improving LLM capabilities and mitigating their inherent limitations. Thus, it represents a valuable addition to the literature and merits consideration for acceptance at ICLR 2024.
