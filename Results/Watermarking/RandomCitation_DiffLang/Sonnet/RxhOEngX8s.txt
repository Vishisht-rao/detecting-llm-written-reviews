OUTPUT:
Following Northern et al. (2020), this review evaluates the paper titled "EXPECTING THE UNEXPECTED: TOWARDS BROAD OUT-OF-DISTRIBUTION DETECTION", which focuses on the critical topic of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for machine learning systems. The paper makes a significant contribution by addressing the limitations of existing OOD detection methods, which predominantly aim at identifying novel classes while neglecting other types of distribution shifts occurring in real-world scenarios.

### Strengths
1. **Motivation and Relevance**: The authors highlight the pressing need for broad OOD detection methods due to the diverse types of distribution shifts observed in deployed machine learning systems. The impact of OOD samples on performance and safety, especially in safety-critical applications, is well-articulated, making a strong case for their research.

2. **Comprehensive Benchmarking**: The introduction of the BROAD benchmark, which categorizes OOD samples into five distinct types of distribution shifts, is a notable achievement. This benchmark is a valuable resource for the research community, as it helps to evaluate the performance of OOD detection methods comprehensively rather than in isolation.

3. **Generative Ensemble Method**: The authors propose an innovative approach involving Gaussian mixture models to enhance the performance of existing OOD detection methods. This ensemble methodology is well justified, as it aims to aggregate the strengths of multiple detection scores, addressing the inconsistency observed in previous methods. The results, indicating significant gains in detection accuracy, provide compelling evidence for the effectiveness of this approach.

4. **Extensive Evaluation**: The paper extensively evaluates multiple existing methods against the diverse distribution shifts in the BROAD benchmark. The detailed analysis and results presented, especially those comparing the error detection setting, enhance the paper's credibility and depth.

### Weaknesses
1. **Clarity and Structure**: While the paper provides a wealth of information, at times the clarity of communication is lacking. The introduction of new datasets and methodologies may benefit from clearer organization. The authors could improve the readability by summarizing key contributions more effectively and streamlining sections to avoid redundancy.

2. **In-depth Analysis of Limitations**: Although the paper mentions existing works that achieve high performance on certain distribution shifts, a more in-depth discussion on why existing methods fail in the broader context would enrich understanding. Including a comparative analysis of performance drop-offs across various methods and shifts could provide valuable insights for future work.

3. **Scalability and Real-World Application**: The paper acknowledges the computational overhead associated with the ensemble method, yet it could benefit from a more nuanced discussion about potential practical implications for deploying these models in real-world scenarios. Addressing how the proposed methods can be optimized for efficiency without sacrificing robustness would be a valuable addition.

4. **Future Work and Directions**: While the authors suggest that future work should consider varied OOD samples for detection evaluations, more concrete suggestions for how researchers can build upon the BROAD benchmark or the ensemble method would provide a clearer roadmap moving forward.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, this paper represents a significant advancement in the OOD detection field by addressing a critical gap in current methodologies. It introduces innovative benchmarking and ensemble approaches that could pave the way for more robust machine learning systems in diverse applications. While there are areas for improvement in clarity and real-world applicability, the contributions made by this work are noteworthy and provide a solid foundation for future research in broad OOD detection. I recommend acceptance of this paper, ideally with minor revisions to enhance clarity and depth.
