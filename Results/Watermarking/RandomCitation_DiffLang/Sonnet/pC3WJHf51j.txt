**Review of the Paper: "Large-Scale Training of Foundation Models for Wearable Biosignals"**

Following Brice et al. (2017), this paper presents significant advancements in the field of wearable health technology, specifically through the large-scale training of foundation models using photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) biosignals. The authors have effectively leveraged a unique dataset obtained from the Apple Heart and Movement Study (AHMS), encompassing over 141,000 participants and spanning three years, which underscores the potential for more robust and generalizable health monitoring solutions.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach:** The paper introduces a self-supervised learning framework that integrates advanced techniques from other domains, such as computer vision. The use of participant-level positive pair selection and sophisticated augmentation methods is particularly commendable and demonstrates a thoughtful approach to address the challenges typically faced in medical data, where annotated datasets are often limited.

2. **Significant Dataset and Impact:** The sheer volume of data utilized in this study (approximately 20 million PPG and 3.75 million ECG segments) is impressive and speaks to the potential for training models that are more representative of diverse populations. This can significantly enhance the generalizability of predictive models used in monitoring health conditions.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The authors perform extensive evaluations of the learned representations, showing that the foundation models effectively encode health-related information, making them predictive of demographics and health conditions. Such rigorous validation is essential for establishing the practical utility of the proposed methods in real-world applications.

4. **Clear Distinction in Modality Performance:** The exploration of how PPG and ECG differ in terms of information encoded within their respective embeddings is illustrative and contributes to a deeper understanding of the signals. The use of visualization techniques, such as t-SNE, effectively conveys the differences between modalities, which could inform future research directions.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Dependence on Self-Reported Data:** While the study leverages a large sample size, the reliance on self-reported health conditions and demographic data may introduce biases or inaccuracies. Future work should aim to validate findings with more objective health measures, possibly integrating other sources of data such as medical records or clinical assessments.

2. **Limited Exploration of Augmentations:** Although the paper mentions the augmentation strategies used, there is a lack of comprehensive tuning for these methods. Understanding the impact of various augmentations and optimizing them per modality could potentially enhance model performance.

3. **Discussion of Limitations:** The authors briefly mention limitations in terms of using opportunistically constructed labels, but a more detailed discussion of potential biases—whether due to sample selection, demographic representation, or longitudinal changes—would strengthen the paper.

4. **Future Directions:** The discussion of potential future work is somewhat generic. More concrete suggestions for subsequent investigations, particularly focusing on longitudinal data analysis and multi-modal integration, would provide clearer pathways for extending this research.

**Overall Evaluation:**

In summary, this paper makes a valuable contribution to wearable health technology by presenting a robust framework for self-supervised learning in PPG and ECG signal analysis. The large-scale application of foundational models demonstrates significant promise for reducing the need for labeled datasets and could accelerate the development of digital biomarkers. Although there are areas that could be elaborated on or improved, the foundational work laid out in this paper is a commendable step forward in the intersection of machine learning and health monitoring. 

**Recommendation:** Accept with minor revisions.
