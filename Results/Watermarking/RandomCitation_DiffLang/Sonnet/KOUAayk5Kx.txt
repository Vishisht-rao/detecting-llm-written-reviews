OUTPUT:
Following Burnell et al. (2020), this article presents a novel approach to address the issue of multi-model forgetting in one-shot neural architecture search (NAS) through the introduction of orthogonal gradient learning (OGL). The paper is well-structured and conveys the motivations behind the research, the proposed methodology, and the experimental validation of their contributions.

### Strengths:

1. **Novel Contribution**: The concept of orthogonal gradient learning as a means to prevent weight overwriting in the context of weight-sharing architectures is a significant proposition. Given the increasing attention to one-shot NAS, this approach provides a fresh perspective on mitigating the challenges associated with multi-model forgetting.

2. **Theoretical Foundation**: The authors provide a solid theoretical framework for OGL, including relevant lemmas and proofs to support their claims. The mathematical rigor lends credibility to the proposed method.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, bolster the claims of efficacy. The comparative analysis against both baseline methods and existing state-of-the-art techniques in multi-model forgetting is particularly commendable.

4. **Clear Visualization and Analysis**: Figure representations of the multi-model forgetting phenomenon and the performance comparisons lend clarity to the presented arguments. The authors effectively illustrate how OGL preserves the validation accuracy of previously trained architectures while reducing error rates.

5. **Potential for Impact**: The proposed methodology can greatly benefit practitioners in the field of NAS and may also open avenues for further research on mitigating forgetting in other shared-weight architectures.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Complexity and Computation Overhead**: One of the concerns is the introduction of additional complexity due to the calculations involved in maintaining the gradient space. While the authors acknowledge this aspect, they could elaborate further on the trade-offs between improved accuracy and computational costs, particularly considering deployment in real-world applications where resources are limited.

2. **Limitations**: The paper could benefit from discussing potential limitations and scenarios where the method might fail or be less effective. For instance, how does OGL perform in different types of networks or datasets with varying complexities? A more detailed analysis of its robustness across diverse conditions would strengthen the paper.

3. **Clarity of Technical Details**: Some sections, particularly those detailing the algorithm and the mathematical rationale, could be simplified. Although the paper is aimed at an audience familiar with NAS, clearer explanations could improve accessibility for a broader range of researchers.

4. **Practical Implementation**: While theoretical performance metrics are presented, including concrete guidelines or a clearer pathway for implementing OGL in existing NAS frameworks would be beneficial. Providing actual code or pseudocode in the supplementary material could enhance reproducibility.

### Conclusion:

In summary, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of neural architecture search by addressing the problem of multi-model forgetting in an innovative way through OGL. The theoretical underpinnings combined with comprehensive experimental validation demonstrate its potential effectiveness. However, further exploration of its complexities, limitations, and practical applications will be essential in establishing its utility in applied settings. This paper is well-suited for acceptance, with minor revisions to enhance clarity and detail in certain areas.
