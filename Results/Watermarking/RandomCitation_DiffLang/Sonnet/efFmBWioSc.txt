**Review of "Multimodal Webnavigation with Instruction-Finetuned Foundation Models"**

Following Santibanez et al. (2014), this review critically evaluates the paper titled "Multimodal Webnavigation with Instruction-Finetuned Foundation Models" submitted for ICLR 2024. The authors, Hiroki Furuta et al., present a novel framework, WebGUM, that leverages multimodal inputs—both webpage screenshots and HTML—to address the complex task of web navigation based on natural language instructions. 

**Summary of Contributions:**
The paper identifies a significant gap in the efficiency of web navigation agents trained through online reinforcement learning (RL), which are often impractical due to high costs associated with exploratory interactions. Instead, the authors propose an off-line training method utilizing instruction-following multimodal foundation models, specifically grounding their solution in instruction-tuned language models in conjunction with vision encoders. The results reported are compelling: WebGUM outperforms previous offline methods significantly on standardized benchmarks like MiniWoB++ and WebShop, demonstrating a remarkable success rate of 94.2% on MiniWoB++—a substantial improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovation and Relevance**: The proposed approach of combining instruction-following multimodal models with off-line training addresses a pertinent problem in web navigation, showcasing the potential of using foundation models in this domain.
2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The authors provide extensive empirical evidence through various experiments, demonstrating that WebGUM excels in tasks requiring HTML comprehension, visual context understanding, and multi-step reasoning.
3. **Large-Scale Dataset**: The collection of a large, multimodal dataset (347K high-quality demonstrations) is an impressive contribution, offering significant value to the research community by enabling further explorations in the field of web navigation.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Task Complexity**: While the paper discusses the benefits of using multimodal inputs, there is limited exploration of the model's performance under highly ambiguous, complex, or unforeseen task conditions. It would be beneficial for the authors to present additional scenarios where the model struggles, as indicated in some examples presented in the paper.
2. **Generalization to Real-World Applications**: Although the authors claim strong positive transfer to real-world tasks on Mind2Web, further validation through real-world scenarios and end-user dependencies could solidify these claims. The paper would benefit from substantial analysis in practical applications beyond benchmark datasets.
3. **Limitations of Modality**: The results highlight that the inclusion of visual information significantly boosts performance. Yet, the authors could elaborate on whether the model can function effectively in scenarios with unpredictable visual domains or if performance drops drastically without image context, indicating the limitations of relying on two modalities.

**Clarity and Presentation:**
The paper is well organized, with a clear introduction that defines the problem and outlines the contributions. However, certain sections—particularly the methodology—could be more concise. Figures and tables are generally well integrated, providing clear comparisons of WebGUM's performance against various baselines.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper makes a noteworthy contribution to the field of autonomous web navigation by presenting a robust framework that effectively utilizes multimodal inputs and instruction-finetuned foundation models. By addressing the outlined weaknesses, the authors could present a more comprehensive argument for the real-world effectiveness and adaptability of their model. I recommend accepting the paper with minor revisions focused on enhancing the exploration of limitations and practical applicability.
