OUTPUT:
Following Esh et al. (2024), this paper presents a novel loss function, TILDE-Q, aimed at improving time-series forecasting by addressing common distortions in temporal data. The authors argue that traditional Lp-norm based loss functions such as mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) fail to capture the intricate dynamical behavior of time-series data. Instead, TILDE-Q is proposed as a transformation invariant loss function that accounts for various distortions, including amplitude shifting and phase shifting, thereby enhancing the model's ability to learn and predict shapes in time-series data.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach:** The proposed TILDE-Q loss function is a compelling attempt to move beyond conventional point-wise error metrics by introducing shape-awareness into the forecasting process. The methodology highlights significant theoretical considerations regarding transformation invariance and related distortions, making a valuable contribution to the field.

2. **Extensive Experiments:** The authors conducted comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets using state-of-the-art models, such as Informer, N-Beats, Autoformer, and FEDformer, as well as simpler models like GRU. This broad experimental scope lends credibility to their claims regarding performance improvements over traditional loss functions.

3. **Clear Contributions:** The paper clearly delineates its contributions: (1) exploration of shape-awareness and distortion invariances, (2) proposing and implementing TILDE-Q, and (3) empirical demonstration of its effectiveness against existing metrics. This makes it easy for readers to grasp its significance and implications.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Methodology Clarity:** While the theoretical foundation and design rationale are well-discussed, some sections—especially in the methodological explanations—could benefit from clearer articulation. For instance, the equations for loss terms, though mathematically valid, may overwhelm readers unfamiliar with advanced optimization techniques. A brief intuitive interpretation of these equations may enhance understanding.

2. **Comparative Analysis:** Although the results show TILDE-Q outperforming MSE and DILATE metrics across various tests, an in-depth comparative analysis or discussion regarding the practical implications of using TILDE-Q in real-world applications would strengthen the findings. As it stands, the results focus primarily on numerical metrics without delving into the interpretability of the forecasting outcomes.

3. **Limitations and Future Work:** The paper would benefit from a more thorough discussion of the limitations of the current approach, such as potential computational inefficiencies or cases where TILDE-Q may not perform as expected. Moreover, outlining future research directions explicitly would provide useful insights into how this work could be expanded upon or refined.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper makes a noteworthy contribution to the field of time-series forecasting by proposing TILDE-Q. By focusing on shape-awareness and transformations, the authors address significant gaps in traditional metrics. With minor improvements in clarity and comparative discussions, this work has the potential to inspire further research and applications in the domain. 

Suggested rating for this submission: 7/10. It is a solid paper with innovative contributions, though it would benefit from further elaboration in certain areas.
