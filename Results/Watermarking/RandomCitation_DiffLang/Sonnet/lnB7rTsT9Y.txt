OUTPUT:
Following Delacruz et al. (2018), this article presents a comprehensive approach to knowledge transfer in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with an emphasis on improving sample efficiency through curriculum learning and modifications of task complexity. The authors address a significant challenge in the field, namely the inefficiency of DRL models in exploring environments from scratch, particularly in scenarios with high-dimensional state-action spaces and sparse reward signals. 

The paper is structured well, presenting a clear motivation for the proposed methods, grounding them in the existing literature on both reinforcement learning and curriculum learning. The introduction effectively lays out the context and problems faced in DRL, providing a solid foundation for the subsequent sections. The use of value functions for transferring knowledge across tasks is particularly intriguing, and the integration of a softmax function to interleave actions between source and target policies is a novel contribution that merits attention.

The authors offer a robust empirical evaluation across various classical environments from OpenAI Gym and a challenging real-world control task related to pump scheduling. The diversity of tasks used for evaluation suggests the generalizability of the proposed method and reflects a well-thought-out experimental design. However, some areas could be improved for a clearer understanding of the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths:
1. **Novel Approach**: The method of leveraging the value function for knowledge transfer is a well-justified innovation that addresses the challenges posed by increasingly complex tasks.
 
2. **Thorough Evaluation**: The empirical evaluation across various environments reinforces the versatility of the proposed method, providing compelling evidence of its effectiveness in improving learning performance.

3. **Implementation Details**: The paper excels in providing detailed information on the implementation of the proposed method, including ANN architectures and training protocols, which promotes reproducibility.

### Weaknesses:
1. **Limited Exploration Discussions**: While the paper highlights the importance of modified degrees of freedom for task complexity, it could benefit from a more in-depth exploration of the potential limitations or pitfalls of modifying these parameters. For example, how does the choice of adjustment impact long-term learning or overfitting to specific tasks?

2. **Ablation Studies**: Although an ablation study is included, the paper could have benefitted from more comprehensive analyses comparing various combinations of the proposed techniques beyond just the Q-weighted sum. This would provide more insight into the effectiveness of the individual components of the approach.

3. **Theoretical Underpinnings**: The paper would be enhanced by a stronger theoretical framework that connects the proposed methods with existing theories in reinforcement learning, particularly regarding the dynamics of value function transfer and entropy management.

4. **Real-World Task Limitations**: In the pump scheduling task, while the discussion of the rewards and constraints is insightful, the paper could explore how the method scales to even more complex real-world problems or frameworks, discussing possible limitations or necessary adjustments in those contexts.

### Conclusion:
Overall, the paper provides a significant contribution to the field of DRL through its innovative approach to knowledge transfer via value functions and curriculum learning. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in exploring theoretical models and discussing limitations, the empirical evidence presented is robust and indicates a meaningful advancement in enhancing the sample efficiency of DRL methods. The findings are likely to encourage further exploration and development of knowledge transfer techniques in various RL applications, making this work a valuable read for both practitioners and researchers in the field.
