OUTPUT:
Following Rankins et al. (2015), this paper presents a novel framework termed Federated Black-box Prompt Tuning (FedBPT), aimed at addressing the pressing challenges associated with fine-tuning large pre-trained language models (PLMs) in federated learning (FL) settings. The authors articulate the key issues of restricted model access, high computational requirements, and substantial communication overheads that plague current FL approaches when applied to PLMs. By shifting the focus from model parameters to prompt optimization—utilizing a gradient-free optimization technique—it promises to enhance communication efficiency and reduce computational costs while facilitating privacy-preserving training.

### Strengths:
1. **Relevance and Timeliness**: The topic is highly relevant given the increasing emphasis on privacy in machine learning, especially concerning user-generated data. The need for effective fine-tuning of PLMs without compromising user privacy is indeed a pressing concern in the NLP community.

2. **Innovative Approach**: The implementation of black-box prompt tuning utilizing gradient-free optimization methods (CMA-ES) is a notable innovation that addresses the limitations associated with gradient-based fine-tuning in federated settings. This approach allows users to interact with high-capacity models securely and efficiently.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The experimental section demonstrates thorough evaluation across multiple datasets and state-of-the-art models (RoBERTa and Llama 2), providing clear evidence that FedBPT can significantly reduce communication costs and memory usage while maintaining competitive performance. The quantitative results highlight the advantages of FedBPT over both gradient-based and traditional gradient-free methods.

4. **Clear Contribution**: The authors effectively delineate their contributions, focusing on the identification of fundamental challenges in federated fine-tuning and offering practical solutions. Additionally, the methods proposed show potential for scalability and adaptability to future PLM developments.

### Weaknesses:
1. **Lack of Detailed Theoretical Justification**: While the authors provide a solid empirical foundation for their claims, the theoretical underpinnings of the effectiveness of their gradient-free optimization approach could be better articulated. A deeper exploration of the conditions under which CMA-ES outperforms traditional methods in federated settings would strengthen the paper.

2. **Handling Non-IID Data**: The exploration into the effects of non-IID data distributions is somewhat limited. Although the authors highlight the challenges posed by non-IID distributions, more detailed strategies to address issues arising from these distributions during local training and server aggregation would enhance the robustness of their claims.

3. **Potential Overfitting Concerns**: Despite the mentioned perturbation method to mitigate overfitting, further analysis of how well FedBPT performs under varying levels of data imbalance and skewness would provide more comprehensive insight. Additional ablation studies exploring different perturbation strategies could substantiate the effectiveness of their proposed solution.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: The paper could benefit from a more diverse set of baseline comparisons, including more recent advancements in federated learning and prompt tuning beyond those mentioned. This comparison would contextualize the performance of FedBPT within the evolving landscape of federated learning techniques.

### Conclusion:
Overall, the paper presents a compelling and innovative approach to federated fine-tuning of PLMs through black-box prompt tuning, demonstrating significant potential in reducing communication costs and enhancing privacy. Despite its strengths, addressing the outlined weaknesses—particularly in terms of theoretical justification and an in-depth analysis of challenges related to non-IID data—would greatly enhance the paper's impact and contribution to the field. The work is a valuable addition to the conference proceedings and merits serious consideration for publication.
