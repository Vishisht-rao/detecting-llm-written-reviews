OUTPUT:
Following Rea et al. (2020), this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of medical imaging by addressing the limitations of existing supervised pre-training methods for 3D models and demonstrating the effectiveness of a newly constructed dataset, AbdomenAtlas 1.1, alongside a suite of pre-trained models termed SuPreM.

### Strengths

1. **Innovative Dataset Creation**: The authors successfully created AbdomenAtlas 1.1, comprising 9,262 annotated CT volumes, which is unprecedented in its scale within the medical imaging domain. The per-voxel annotations for 25 anatomical structures and seven tumor types provide a rich foundation for training models intended for 3D medical imaging tasks. This resource not only fills a gap in the availability of annotated 3D datasets but also serves as a valuable asset for the research community.

2. **Demonstrated Efficiency**: The paper presents compelling evidence of superior transfer learning capabilities when using supervised pre-training compared to existing self-supervised methodologies. The reported findings highlight that a model pre-trained on a minimal dataset (21 CT volumes) performs comparably to one trained on a much larger dataset (5,050 volumes), thus emphasizing the efficiency of the supervised learning approach. This aspect will likely resonate strongly with practitioners who require high accuracy with limited annotated data.

3. **Robust Performance Across Datasets**: The experiments conducted show that the SuPreM models can generalize well across different external datasets, achieving competitive performance without additional fine-tuning. This suggests strong applicability and flexibility of the models developed, which is crucial for real-world medical applications.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: The authors provide a thorough comparison of their results with existing models, effectively demonstrating the advantages of the SuPreM models in both organ and tumor segmentation tasks. This comparative approach adds robustness to their findings and clearly illustrates the advancements their work contributes to the field.

### Weaknesses

1. **Limited Discussion of Self-Supervised Learning**: While the authors highlight the advantages of supervised pre-training, the paper could benefit from a more balanced discussion regarding the landscape of self-supervised learning. Given the rapid advancements in self-supervised techniques, a deeper exploration of how these methods may evolve or complement supervised approaches in the future would be beneficial.

2. **Generalization Limitations**: Although the models exhibit promising results on external datasets, the paper could strengthen its claims by exploring potential limitations or biases that may still exist due to the training data. For example, examining how well the model performs on specific populations or underrepresented anatomical structures could provide valuable insights.

3. **Computational Costs**: The efficiency claims regarding computational resources saved could be elaborated further. The study details the GPU hours required for both training regimes but could include more comprehensive discussion about the cost-effectiveness in real-world clinical settings or within resource-constrained environments.

4. **Future Work Directions**: The paper hints at future expansion of the dataset and model offerings but lacks a concrete roadmap or specific proposals for further research. Outlining potential avenues for future investigations would provide readers with a clearer vision of how this work may influence subsequent developments in medical imaging.

### Conclusion

Overall, this paper makes a substantial contribution to the field of 3D medical imaging by presenting a novel dataset and demonstrating the effectiveness of supervised pre-trained models. The efficiency and robustness of their findings position the study as a noteworthy advancement. However, expanding the discussion around self-supervised learning and addressing potential limitations would enhance the overall impact of the work. With these considerations, the paper should be regarded as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners alike in the pursuit of improved medical imaging technologies.
