**Review of "Adversarial Defense Using Targeted Manifold Manipulation"**

Following Cavallaro et al. (2017), this paper presents a novel approach to defending against adversarial attacks on deep learning models using a technique termed Targeted Manifold Manipulation (TMM). The authors propose a framework that modifies the gradient flow from the genuine data manifold to aid in both defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks and detection of potentially malicious inputs.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Concept:** The idea of directing adversarial attacks towards "trapdoors" within a manipulated manifold represents a creative and interesting approach to adversarial defense. The authors effectively highlight the need for models that can be both robust against attacks and maintain high clean accuracy. The use of trapdoors as a lure for adversarial perturbations is an original contribution.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper includes extensive experimentation across six state-of-the-art adversarial attacks and four well-known image datasets (GTSRB, SVHN, CIFAR-10, Tiny Imagenet). The reported results showing âˆ¼99% detection accuracy while maintaining competitive clean accuracy support the effectiveness of the proposed method.

3. **Dual Defense Mechanism:** The provision of both online (live-attack protection) and offline (detection of attacks without intermediate labels) detection mechanisms showcases a robust design. This feature enhances the practicality of the defense method in real-world applications.

4. **Integration of Existing Research:** The authors effectively build upon previous works in adversarial defense and provide a well-contextualized discussion in the related work section. This demonstrates the authors' solid understanding of the current research landscape.

5. **Robustness to Non-Attack Perturbations:** The paper's claim of resilience to semantic-preserving perturbations adds an important dimension to the evaluation of the defense mechanism, which is often overlooked in adversarial defense literature.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity of Implementation:** While the concept of TMM is intriguing, the practical implementation of the proposed method may be complex, particularly with regard to the training process and generating trapdoors. Further clarification on the computational requirements and the scalability of the approach as the number of classes increases would be beneficial.

2. **Comparative Results Lack Depth:** Although comparisons with existing defenses are included, the paper could benefit from deeper analysis and discussion regarding the comparative performance of TMM against these benchmarks, beyond mere accuracy metrics. For example, it would be useful to evaluate the computational overhead in more detail.

3. **Adaptive Attack Scenarios:** The evaluation of TMM against adaptive attacks is mentioned but should be expanded. A more detailed analysis of how well the proposed method performs against adversarial examples that account for knowledge of the TMM detection mechanisms would strengthen the defense's robustness claims.

4. **Clarification of Terminology and Concepts:** Some terminology, such as "trap-ring" and the specific workings of the trapdoors, could be explained more clearly. Adding visual diagrams or examples to illustrate the TMM architecture and trap mechanisms would enhance comprehension.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a promising new defense strategy against adversarial attacks in deep learning models, with the potential for high efficacy and novel detection methods. Despite some concerns regarding complexity and further exploration against adaptive attacks, the innovative use of manifold manipulation and trapdoors is commendable and could significantly advance the field. Further refinement in the explanation and evaluation methods will strengthen the contribution of this paper to the ongoing discourse on adversarial robustness. 

**Recommendation:** Accept with minor revisions.
