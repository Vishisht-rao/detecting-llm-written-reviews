OUTPUT:
Following Costantino et al. (2024), this paper presents a novel approach to GNN-to-MLP distillation called VQGRAPH, which focuses on enhancing the expressiveness of graph representation spaces. The authors argue that conventional methods have limitations in representing diverse local graph structures, which may hinder the effective transfer of knowledge from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs). VQGRAPH aims to address these issues by employing a structure-aware graph tokenizer based on a variant of VQ-VAE to create a powerful codebook that captures local graph structures.

### Strengths:
1. **Novelty of Approach**: The proposed method of directly labeling nodes' local structures with discrete codes rather than using class labels is an innovative paradigm shift that has the potential to greatly enhance knowledge distillation in graph-based models.

2. **Performance Improvements**: The authors have conducted extensive experiments across multiple datasets, demonstrating that VQGRAPH outperforms both GNNs and state-of-the-art GNN-to-MLP distillation techniques (such as NOSMOG) in terms of accuracy and inference speed. The reported average improvements of 3.90% over GNNs and 28.05% over MLPs showcase the real-world applicability of the model, particularly due to the significantly faster inference time.

3. **Comprehensive Ablation Studies**: The paper includes detailed ablation studies which effectively illustrate the contribution of different components of the proposed approach. This strengthens the validity of their claims about the advantages of using a structure-aware codebook and soft code assignments.

4. **Rigorous Evaluation**: The authors have effectively assessed the robustness of VQGRAPH under varying noise conditions, showing that the model maintains performance even when subjected to significant perturbations in input data.

### Weaknesses:
1. **Complexity of Implementation**: While the concept is promising, the implementation of the proposed methods may be complex for practitioners. Greater clarity on the computational overhead introduced by the tokenizer and the training process would be beneficial for reproducibility.

2. **Generalizability of the Approach**: Although the results on the presented datasets are impressive, the paper would benefit from a discussion on the generalizability of the method to different types of graphs (e.g., heterogeneous or dynamic graphs) beyond those evaluated. 

3. **Visualization Needs**: Although there are visualizations (such as the t-SNE plots) presented, some figures could benefit from improved labeling and clarity. More explicit annotations on how the visualizations support the claims made in the analysis would make the conclusions drawn more compelling.

4. **Limited Datasets for Comparison**: The paper primarily focuses on a few well-established benchmark datasets. Expanding the evaluation to include diverse real-world datasets and more complex, less structured graphs could provide a more robust assessment of VQGRAPH's capabilities.

### Conclusion:
Overall, the paper presents a significant advancement in the field of GNN-to-MLP distillation by introducing VQGRAPH, which successfully enhances graph representation with a novel labeling strategy. The experimental results are promising, indicating that VQGRAPH could bridge the gap between GNNs and MLPs effectively. The proposed method holds considerable potential for future applications, yet the complexity of the implementation and the need for broader testing suggest areas for further improvement. Therefore, the paper merits publication with the attention to these considerations addressed.
