**Review of "CNNGen: A Generator and Benchmark for Sustainable Convolutional Neural Network Search"**

Following Gilliland et al. (2020), this paper presents a novel approach to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) through the introduction of CNNGen, a context-free grammar-based architecture generator. This tool addresses significant limitations currently observed in cell-based NAS methods, notably the lack of diversity in generated architectures and the absence of considerations related to sustainability. 

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Contribution**: The authors propose a significant advancement in the domain of CNN design by leveraging a domain-specific language (DSL) to allow for a broader exploration of architectures beyond predefined cells. This opens avenues for discovering innovative architectures that may not have been considered typical in traditional frameworks.

2. **Consideration of Sustainability**: The emphasis on energy consumption and carbon footprint in model training is timely and crucial, especially in the current climate, where the environmental impact of machine learning practices is under scrutiny. This addition to performance metrics represents a progressive step towards more sustainable machine learning practices, aligning well with growing concerns about the ecological cost of deep learning.

3. **Dataset Diversity**: The generated architecture set from CNNGen demonstrates greater variance in performance metrics compared to existing benchmarks (like NASBench101). This increased diversity in model performance could enhance the training of performance predictive models, potentially leading to better model selection and resource allocation.

4. **Predictive Modeling**: The comparison of performance prediction models offers valuable insights. The authors show that the code-based predictor outperforms the state-of-the-art predictor in accuracy, which is a significant finding that could encourage future research in utilizing model code for performance estimation.

5. **Open Science Policy**: The provision of publicly available datasets and the CNNGen tool promotes transparency and reproducibility within the research community, which is commendable.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Comparisons**: While the paper makes a compelling case for the advantages of CNNGen, it could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with additional state-of-the-art NAS approaches apart from the selected baseline. This would strengthen the claim regarding its superiority in terms of architecture diversity and performance prediction.

2. **Clarification and Justification**: The paper mentions that certain architectures generated by CNNGen yield lower accuracy metrics compared to those from NASBench101. It would be beneficial for the authors to elaborate on the implications of these findingsâ€”specifically, how they can still be useful for the NAS community, given the goal of exploring architectures.

3. **Scalability Concerns**: Potential scalability issues with CNNGen are not addressed. For practical applications, understanding how well this method scales with larger datasets and more complex architectures remains critical.

4. **Performance Metrics**: While the inclusion of energy consumption is laudable, additional metrics related to other environmental impacts (like water usage or material sustainability) could provide a more holistic view of the sustainability aspect.

5. **Grammar and DSL Complexity**: The paper briefly touches on the DSL's grammar; however, a more in-depth discussion regarding its complexities and limitations would better prepare users for practical implementation.

**Conclusion:**
This paper introduces CNNGen, a promising tool for enhancing diversity and sustainability in CNN design via NAS, responding to critical challenges in the field. While the groundwork laid by this study is solid and presents numerous strengths, including sustainability considerations and the exploration of novel architectures, greater comparisons and rich discussions around limitations could enhance its impact. Overall, the research contributes significantly to the NAS community and sets the stage for future advancements in sustainable machine learning practices. 

**Recommendation:** Accept with minor revisions.
