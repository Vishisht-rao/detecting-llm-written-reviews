***Review of "A Comprehensive Study of Privacy Risks in Curriculum Learning" (Under Review as a Conference Paper at ICLR 2024)***

Following Bierman et al. (2023), this article presents a timely and relevant exploration into the intersection of curriculum learning (CL) and privacy risks, specifically focusing on membership inference attacks (MIA) and attribute inference attacks (AIA). The paper is well-structured, providing a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on CL and the associated privacy risks, along with significant experimental findings. 

### Strengths:

1. **Novelty and Contribution**: This work is pioneering in its effort to investigate the privacy vulnerabilities of CL, an area that has largely been overlooked in the extant literature on machine learning. The authors introduce essential new insights regarding how different training techniques affect the susceptibility of models to privacy attacks.

2. **Methodological Rigor**: The authors utilize a range of well-established attack methods (NN-based, metric-based, label-only MIA, and AIA) across multiple datasets, providing an extensive evaluation framework. The introduction of Diff-Cali, a novel MIA that leverages difficulty scores to enhance calibration, is particularly noteworthy and demonstrates thoughtful innovation.

3. **Clear Results and Analysis**: The results are clearly presented, with tables and figures that effectively illustrate the findings. The analysis of how CL impacts MIA vulnerability, especially regarding difficult versus easy samples, contributes significantly to the understanding of privacy risks in ML.

4. **Defense Evaluation**: The assessment of existing defense mechanisms such as DP-SGD, MemGuard, and MixupMMD under CL conditions adds an additional layer of insight, illustrating the trade-offs between privacy and model performance.

5. **Interdisciplinary Relevance**: The implications of this research extend beyond machine learning into areas such as data ethics, privacy law, and algorithmic fairness, making it pertinent for a wide audience.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Limited Contextualization**: While the authors provide a thorough background on CL and privacy attacks, the context surrounding the broader implications of their findings could be expanded. Specifically, discussing the societal implications of the privacy risks associated with CL could enhance the paperâ€™s impact and relevance.

2. **Discussion on Limitations**: The paper could benefit from a more explicit discussion of the limitations of the study. For instance, the authors could address potential biases in the datasets used or the generalizability of their findings to other domains of machine learning.

3. **Future Work Recommendations**: While the authors touch on potential future work, explicit recommendations or directions for future research could strengthen the concluding sections. This would provide readers with a clearer path forward for exploration in this emerging area.

4. **Comparison of Different Architectures**: While the study includes results from different architectures, more in-depth analysis on how model architectures influence privacy risks could provide additional insights. For example, examining if certain architectures are inherently more resistant to these types of attacks would be informative.

### Conclusion:

Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the understanding of privacy risks in curriculum learning. The novel insights, comprehensive analysis, and methodological rigor establish a strong foundation for future research in this area. By addressing the identified weaknesses, particularly regarding contextual implications and limitations, the paper could be further strengthened. I recommend accepting this paper for presentation at ICLR 2024, as it stimulates important discussions regarding the evolving landscape of machine learning and privacy.
