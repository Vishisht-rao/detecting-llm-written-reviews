**Reviewer Comments on "BEYOND IMITATION: LEVERAGING FINE-GRAINED QUALITY SIGNALS FOR ALIGNMENT"**

**Summary:**
The paper proposes a novel approach called FIGA for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. This approach seeks to improve upon existing methodologies like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) by leveraging fine-grained quality signals derived from the difference between initial and revised responses. The authors claim that this approach not only enhances the alignment of LLMs but does so with improved efficiency and without the complexities often associated with RLHF.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Contribution:** The paper addresses a vital issue in the alignment of LLMs by introducing fine-grained quality signals, which enhances the understanding of good versus bad actions. This approach is a significant contribution to the ongoing discussions in the alignment community.

2. **Extensive Experiments:** The authors conduct thorough experiments and comparisons against multiple baseline methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of FIGA. They provide convincing quantitative results, showing that FIGA outperforms both standard SFT and RL methods in various benchmarks.

3. **Data Curation:** The creation of the SubParAlignment (SPA) dataset, which pairs less effective model outputs with high-quality responses, showcases an innovative data preparation strategy aimed explicitly at improving learning outcomes.

4. **Clarity and Structure:** The paper is generally well-structured, with coherent sections that facilitate understanding of the methodology, experiments, and results. The figures and tables present data clearly, enhancing the interpretability of the findings.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Discussion on Limitations:** While the paper presents a robust methodology, it lacks an in-depth discussion regarding potential limitations or shortcomings of the FIGA approach. Addressing issues such as scalability, the need for diverse datasets, or situations where the approach may fail would strengthen the paper.

2. **Theoretical Foundation:** Although the paper claims that its loss function mimics certain aspects of RL, it does not delve deeply into the theoretical underpinnings comparing FIGA with traditional RL methods. Further clarification on how this method captures the advantages of RLHF without adding its complexity would be beneficial.

3. **Generalization:** The experiments mainly focus on specific benchmarks. A more diverse range of out-of-distribution tests could provide better insights into the generalizability of FIGA across different domains and types of tasks.

4. **Complexity of Implementation:** While FIGA is presented as an easy-to-implement method, the underlying complexity of accurately generating and revising responses using another LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) may pose challenges for practical implementations. A discussion on the resource implications of using such dual-model setups could be helpful.

5. **Human Evaluation Framework:** The human evaluation portions could be improved with more systematic methodologies and a larger sample size. While the results are promising, clearer metrics or methods for evaluation would strengthen the empirical findings.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents innovative contributions to the field of LLM alignment, particularly through the introduction of fine-grained quality signals and the SPA dataset. The empirical results are promising, showcasing FIGA as a competitive alignment approach. However, a more comprehensive discussion on limitations and theoretical implications, as well as an expanded evaluation framework, would enhance the paper's rigor. This work represents an essential step forward in addressing the alignment problem, and I would recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the noted weaknesses. 

**Rating:** 7/10 - Good quality with potential for improvement.
