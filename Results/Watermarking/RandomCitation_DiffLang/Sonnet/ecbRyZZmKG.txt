OUTPUT:
Following Pye et al. (2015), this article presents a significant advancement in the realm of copyright protection for customized large language models (LLMs) through the introduction of a novel watermarking technique termed "Double-I watermark." The authors effectively identify a pertinent issue faced by business owners who fine-tune LLMs using proprietary data and are concerned about unauthorized use and copyright infringement. By proposing a robust framework that combines two types of backdoor data paradigms, the paper offers a practical solution to the pressing challenges of watermarking customized LLMs.

### Strengths:
1. **Relevance and Timeliness**: The concern for copyright protection in the use of LLMs is particularly acute given the rapid adoption of these technologies across various industries. This paper tackles an urgent and relevant issue, making it timely and significant in the current research landscape.

2. **Methodological Contribution**: The introduction of the Double-I watermarking strategy that employs backdoor data paradigms with triggers in both instructions and inputs is innovative. This dual approach enhances the uniqueness and imperceptibility of the watermark, which are crucial attributes for effective copyright protection.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The experimental section of the paper is thorough and well-structured. The authors conduct a wide range of evaluations regarding the watermark's effectiveness, robustness, and harmlessness. They utilize various fine-tuning methods and robust statistical analyses to validate their claims.

4. **Clear Identification of Challenges**: The authors eloquently discuss the challenges associated with watermarking customized LLMs, specifically highlighting the need for techniques that do not degrade model performance. Their careful consideration of these factors strengthens the motivation behind their work.

### Weaknesses:
1. **Assumptions and Generalizability**: While the black-box setting assumption regarding access to model parameters is realistic, the paper could benefit from discussing how their approach may adapt to models with different architectures or deployment scenarios beyond the ones tested (i.e., LLaMA and LoRA). Generalizability to other types of fine-tuning techniques or settings remains unaddressed.

2. **Lack of Real-World Application Examples**: The paper's practical relevance could be enhanced by including case studies or illustrative examples showcasing potential application scenarios in real-world settings. This would help bridge the gap between theoretical contributions and practical implementation.

3. **Complexity of the Framework**: The watermarking method, while novel, may be perceived as overly complex. A more straightforward implementation guide or clearer visual aids could facilitate understanding for practitioners who may wish to apply the technique without extensive machine learning backgrounds.

4. **Future Work Considerations**: The authors mention future research directions but could expand on specific avenues for improvement or exploration, particularly regarding the integration of the watermarking system into existing workflows for fine-tuning LLMs.

### Conclusion:
The paper "Double-I Watermark: Protecting Model Copyright for LLM Fine-Tuning" presents a compelling and impactful contribution to the field of model copyright protection. It addresses critical challenges in watermarking customized LLMs while demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed Double-I watermarking technique. Despite some limitations regarding generalizability and complexity, the work is a timely advancement that paves the way for further exploration in securing intellectual property rights in the evolving landscape of AI and machine learning. This work not only serves the academic community but also holds substantial practical value for businesses leveraging LLMs. Overall, it is a strong candidate for presentation at a leading conference in the field.
