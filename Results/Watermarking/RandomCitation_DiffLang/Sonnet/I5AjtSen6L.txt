OUTPUT:
Following Clouse et al. (2014), this article addresses a critical issue concerning the fairness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the presence of adversarial attacks, introducing a novel framework named ELEGANT. Overall, the manuscript presents significant contributions to the domain of fairness in GNNs and certifiable defenses, yet there are several areas that require further clarification and improvement.

**Strengths:**

1. **Timely and Relevant Topic:** The paper tackles an increasingly important issue in machine learning, specifically in the context of GNNs, where fairness has become paramount due to the growing societal implications of biased predictions.

2. **Comprehensive Theoretical Framework:** The authors provide a detailed theoretical analysis of their proposed method, ELEGANT, demonstrating the framework's ability to achieve certifiable fairness without altering the GNN structure or requiring re-training. This aspect significantly increases the practicality of the framework.

3. **Extensive Empirical Evaluation:** The experimental results across multiple real-world datasets are thorough. The authors successfully validate the effectiveness of ELEGANT in maintaining fairness and utility under various adversarial attack scenarios, presenting a compelling argument for the framework's robustness.

4. **Generalizability of the Framework:** ELEGANT's plug-and-play nature, suitable for various GNN architectures, is a notable advantage, which highlights its applicability in real-world scenarios where diverse GNNs might be used.

5. **Addressing Both Modalities of Input:** The paper's focus on both node attributes and graph structure is commendable. The development of certified defense strategies for both input types showcases an innovative approach to the issue of fairness.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Clarity and Conciseness:** The writing could benefit from a more straightforward structure. Some sections, particularly the introduction and the problem definition, could be condensed to improve readability. The current length may impede understanding, especially for readers who are less familiar with the technical details.

2. **Detailed Experimental Setup:** While the results are impressive, the authors should provide more information on the specific configurations of the experiments, such as hyper-parameter tuning and details regarding the datasets (e.g., demographics, biases present). Transparency in experimental design will enhance reproducibility.

3. **Comparison with State-of-the-Art:** Although the paper includes comparisons with existing methods, it lacks a thorough discussion regarding the advantages and limitations of ELEGANT relative to these methods. A more in-depth comparison, including qualitative aspects, would strengthen the argument for its effectiveness.

4. **Robustness under Diverse Attacks:** The authors should consider including results for additional types of attacks or perturbation methods to showcase the robustness of ELEGANT. Understanding how it performs under various attack strategies will provide a more comprehensive picture of its capabilities.

5. **Implications and Future Work:** The conclusion section could further elaborate on potential real-world implications of deploying ELEGANT, especially in sensitive areas like hiring, lending, or criminal justice. Additionally, it would be beneficial to discuss the future avenues of research and any limitations of the current framework.

**Overall Impression:**
The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of fairness in GNNs. The proposed framework, ELEGANT, offers an innovative solution for certifying fairness against adversarial attacks without necessitating alterations to existing GNN architectures. With enhancements in clarity, methodology comparisons, and robustness analysis under diverse attack scenarios, the work has the potential to make a significant impact on the practical deployment of fair GNNs. Therefore, I recommend a "minor revision".
