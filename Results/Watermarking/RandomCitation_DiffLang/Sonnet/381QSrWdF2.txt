OUTPUT:
Following Markey et al. (2017), this paper presents a significant advancement in understanding stochastic gradient descent (SGD) by investigating the relationship between SGD dynamics, its stationary distribution, and the symmetries present in the loss landscapes of neural networks. The authors propose a "law of balance" that emerges from considering the rescaling symmetry of loss functions and demonstrate how this enables a deeper comprehension of the complex behaviors exhibited by SGD in deep learning contexts.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Contribution:** The introduction of the law of balance offers a novel theoretical framework for analyzing SGD, particularly regarding its stationary distribution. The finding that SGD converges towards balanced solutions in the presence of rescaling symmetry adds a compelling layer to existing theories about optimization in deep learning.

2. **Analytical Insights:** The authors provide analytical expressions for stationary distributions under various scenarios, which is a notable achievement given the complexities associated with highly nonlinear and degenerate loss landscapes. This may pave the way for additional theoretical research and applications in deep learning.

3. **Thorough Examination of Dynamics:** The paper thoroughly explores the dynamics of SGD and contrasts it against traditional methods, such as gradient descent (GD) and naive Langevin models. This comprehensive approach helps clarify where these models may fail to describe the actual behaviors of SGD.

4. **Connection to Empirical Observations:** The phenomena of fluctuation inversion and loss of ergodicity, unique to deep networks as shown in the paper, are indeed intriguing. The paper's findings align with practical observations in machine learning, thus bridging theory and empirical evidence, which enhances its relevance to practitioners.

5. **Clear Structure and Presentation:** The paper is well-organized, with a clear progression from the formulation of the problem to the analysis and derivation of results. The rigorous mathematical derivations are complemented by well-defined theorems and corollaries, making it accessible to both theoretical and applied audiences.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Scope of Generalization:** While the analytical results are presented for diagonal linear networks and certain symmetrical cases, the applicability of these results may be limited when transitioning to more complex, nonlinear architectures typical in practice. A discussion on potential limitations or necessary conditions for broader applicability would strengthen the paper.

2. **Empirical Validation:** Although the paper references empirical observations, the absence of extensive experimental validation throughout various scenarios may leave some readers questioning the robustness of the theoretical claims. Inclusion of experiments verifying the theoretical predictions on actual datasets and architectures would provide added credibility.

3. **Comparative Analysis:** A more extensive discussion comparing the authors' findings and associated dynamics with existing approaches in the literature could further articulate the significance of their contributions. It might help to situate their results within the broader landscape of SGD research.

4. **Clarity of Specific Examples:** While specific examples are provided for two-layer networks and the derivation of stationary distribution, further illustrative examples showing the divergence of behaviors in varying depths or widths could help clarify the paper's implications for neural network design.

5. **Notation and Terminology:** Some mathematical notation may require clearer definitions, especially for readers not familiar with the advanced concepts. Clarifying terms used throughout the proofs could enhance readability and comprehension.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, this paper provides valuable insights into the dynamics and stationary behavior of stochastic gradient descent in the context of deep learning. It establishes a theoretical foundation that can serve as a jumping-off point for future research exploring the implications of symmetry in loss functions. Addressing the identified weaknesses, especially through empirical validation and a broader exploration of the results, can further solidify the contribution of this work to the field of optimization in machine learning. Overall, it represents a commendable and thought-provoking addition to the current discourse on SGD and neural network training.
