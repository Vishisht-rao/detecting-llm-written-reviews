**Review of "THE CERTIFICATION PARADOX: CERTIFICATIONS ADMIT BETTER EVASION ATTACKS"**

Following Hibbs et al. (2018), this paper presents a thoroughly engaging exploration of the complex interplay between certification mechanisms in adversarial robustness and the potential vulnerabilities they may inadvertently introduce. The authors articulate a significant contribution by introducing the Certification Aware Attack, which exploits certified guarantees to generate more effective norm-minimizing evasion attacks. This paradox challenges the conventional understanding of robustness certifications, raising important implications for the future of certified defenses in machine learning.

**Strengths:**

1. **Original Contribution:** The concept of the Certification Aware Attack is a novel addition to the area of adversarial machine learning. The exploration of how certifications can be exploited rather than merely circumvented offers fresh insights into the vulnerabilities of certified models.

2. **Quantitative Results:** The experimental results are robust and provide a clear demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed attack method compared to established alternatives such as PGD and Carlini-Wagner. The authors claim a significant reduction in the median perturbation norm by over 10% and a success rate improvement of more than 74%, which is promising.

3. **Comprehensive Background:** The paper successfully contextualizes its contributions within existing literature on adversarial examples and certified defenses. The background section effectively highlights gaps in prior research, specifically regarding the lack of focus on attacks targeting certified models.

4. **Implications for Security Practices:** The discussion around the paradox of certifications and their potential to enhance attacks adds an important layer of complexity to the discourse on certifiability in machine learning. The authors offer constructive recommendations, although the ultimate mitigation strategies require further exploration.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Assumptions in Threat Models:** The paper primarily considers a white-box attack scenario, where the attacker has full access to model gradients and certifications. While this is a valuable perspective, it may limit the applicability of findings to real-world situations where adversaries have more restricted access. Exploring black-box scenarios could yield additional insights into the vulnerability of certified models.

2. **Computational Efficiency Concerns:** While the authors claim that the Certification Aware Attack can reduce computational burdens, more robust comparisons of computational efficiency relative to different types of certification methods would strengthen the claim. Particularly for high-dimensional datasets like ImageNet, the feasibility of implementation in real situational contexts may be challenged.

3. **Mitigation Strategies:** Although the paper suggests restricting released certifications, there is insufficient elaboration on practical implementations of this idea and its potential consequences. As mentioned, certifications can be reconstructed from class expectations, thus proposing a nuanced approach that balances security and utility would be beneficial.

4. **Generalizability of Results:** Future work may benefit from validating the findings across a wider array of datasets and models beyond those tested in this work. The mention of MACER-certified models is promising, yet a broader exploration of various certification methods could enhance understanding of the robustness landscape.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, this paper sheds light on a critical and previously underexplored aspect of adversarial robustness and certification mechanisms. The contribution is significant, and the findings provoke thoughtful discussion on the safety and implications of releasing robustness certifications. Despite a few weaknesses related to generalizability and the assumptions of the threat model, the innovative approach and compelling experimental results position this work as an important step in the ongoing quest to understand and improve machine learning security. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the concerns identified.
