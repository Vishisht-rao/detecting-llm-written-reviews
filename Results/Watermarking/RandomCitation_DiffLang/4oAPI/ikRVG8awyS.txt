## Review of "RFold: RNA Secondary Structure Prediction with Decoupled Optimization"

This paper presents RFold, a novel deep learning model for RNA secondary structure prediction. The authors argue that existing methods suffer from limitations in generalization and computational complexity, primarily due to complex post-processing optimization steps and reliance on hand-crafted features. RFold addresses these issues through a decoupled optimization approach and the use of learned attention maps.

The core innovation of RFold lies in its decoupled optimization strategy. By decomposing the constraint satisfaction problem into row-wise and column-wise optimizations, RFold simplifies the process while ensuring output validity. This contrasts with methods like E2Efold, which employ complex, iterative optimization that can lead to constraint violations.  Furthermore, RFold replaces the hand-crafted features used in methods like UFold with a Seq2map attention mechanism. This module learns informative representations directly from the RNA sequence, eliminating the need for expert knowledge and computationally expensive pre-processing.

The experimental results presented are compelling. RFold achieves state-of-the-art performance on the RNAStralign dataset, significantly outperforming existing methods in terms of F1 score. Notably, RFold also demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, achieving competitive results on the ArchiveII and bpRNA-new datasets.  The authors also showcase improved performance on long-range interactions within RNA sequences, a challenging aspect of structure prediction. Furthermore, the simplified architecture of RFold translates to significantly faster inference times compared to competitors, especially UFold and MXfold2.

The ablation studies provide further insights into the contributions of the individual components.  The decoupled optimization strategy is shown to be crucial for achieving valid structures, while the Seq2map attention mechanism provides informative representations without the computational overhead of hand-crafted features. The visualization examples effectively demonstrate the ability of RFold to predict complex, non-nested structures. The inclusion of the soft-RFold variant and its performance on abnormal samples further strengthens the practicality of the approach.

Despite these strengths, there are areas for improvement.  The strict constraints imposed by RFold might lead to overlooking some true interactions. The authors acknowledge this limitation and propose a soft-RFold variant as a potential solution.  However, as noted by Lacour et al. (2021), further research is needed to explore more sophisticated balancing mechanisms for precision and recall. A more detailed analysis of the types of interactions missed by RFold compared to other methods would further enhance the paper.

Overall, this paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of RNA secondary structure prediction. RFold's innovative decoupled optimization and learned attention mechanism address key limitations of existing methods, leading to improved accuracy, generalization, and inference speed.  Addressing the limitations regarding the strictness of constraints would further solidify its position as a leading method in this domain.


**Minor Comments:**

* The related work section provides a comprehensive overview of the field.  However, a more concise summary table comparing the key features and limitations of different methods could further enhance readability.
* The visualization in Figure 3 and 4 could benefit from clearer labels and explanations.
*  The paper would benefit from a discussion on the limitations of the U-Net architecture within the context of RNA structure prediction.


In conclusion, I recommend accepting this paper.  RFold's novel contributions and strong empirical results make it a valuable addition to the literature.
