OUTPUT:
This paper proposes Bilevel-LLM, a novel framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for decision-making in complex environments.  The core idea is to learn both how to generate effective prompts for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and how to act based on the resulting thoughts.  The framework uses a bilevel optimization structure where a prompt-generation policy learns to produce prompts that minimize the uncertainty (entropy) of a separate action policy.  The action policy, in turn, learns to maximize environmental rewards using the CoT outputs generated by an LLM like GPT-3.5, guided by the learned prompts.

**Strengths:**

* **Novel Approach:** The bilevel framework for joint prompt learning and action policy training is a significant contribution. Addressing the challenge of prompt engineering automatically offers a promising direction for more generalizable LLM-based agents.
* **Strong Empirical Results:**  The experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to baselines like GFlan and Vanilla PPO in several benchmark environments (ChainWorld, FourRoom, Overcooked).  The lower variance observed also suggests a more stable learning process.
* **Ablation Studies:**  The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of individual components.  The analyses on prompt policy strategies, entropy objective, and multimodal state representation contribute to a better understanding of the framework.
* **Addressing Practical Challenges:**  The paper tackles realistic issues such as grounding LLM outputs to executable actions and reducing reliance on handcrafted prompts.  These are crucial steps towards deploying LLM-based agents in real-world scenarios.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Clarity and Presentation:**  While the overall idea is intriguing, certain aspects could benefit from improved clarity. The mathematical formulation of the bilevel optimization problem could be more concise and explicit.  The description of the experimental setup and hyperparameter choices could be more detailed in the main text or appendix.  Additional illustrative examples might enhance understanding.
* **Computational Cost:** Using LLMs like GPT-3.5 for CoT reasoning can be computationally expensive, particularly for real-time applications. The paper acknowledges this and mentions situation abstraction as a mitigation strategy, but a more in-depth discussion of computational costs and potential scalability issues would be valuable.
* **Limited Exploration of LLM Architectures:** The paper primarily focuses on GPT-3.5 for CoT reasoning and Flan-T5 for the action policy.  Exploring the impact of different LLM architectures and sizes on the framework's performance would strengthen the analysis.
* **Novelty of individual components:** While the overall framework is novel, some components like using policy gradients for prompt learning and PPO for action policy training are based on existing techniques.  A clearer articulation of the novelty within the integration of these components would be beneficial.

**Overall:**

The paper presents a promising new direction for LLM-based decision-making. The proposed Bilevel-LLM framework addresses important challenges in prompt engineering and action policy learning. While some aspects of clarity and practicality could be improved, the strong empirical results and insightful ablation studies make this a valuable contribution to the field.  Further research exploring computational efficiency, different LLM architectures, and more complex environments would be highly beneficial.
