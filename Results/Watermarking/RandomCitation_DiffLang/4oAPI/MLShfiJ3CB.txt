Review of "Towards Reliable Backdoor Attacks on Vision Transformers"

This paper presents a timely and insightful investigation into the backdoor robustness of Vision Transformers (ViTs).  While prior work has suggested ViTs are more vulnerable to backdoor attacks than CNNs, this paper challenges that assumption, arguing that previous evaluations were flawed due to the inappropriate adaptation of CNN-based defenses to ViTs.  The authors convincingly demonstrate this through experiments showing that, with proper adjustments to existing defense mechanisms (like fine-tuning and pruning), ViTs achieve comparable robustness to CNNs.

A key contribution of the paper is the identification of the discrepancy in optimizer usage between training and defense as a contributing factor to the perceived vulnerability.  The authors recommend using AdamW for both training and defense, leading to significantly improved performance.  Furthermore, they advise using fewer fine-tuning epochs for ViTs due to their sensitivity to overfitting with limited clean data.  These practical training recipes are valuable for researchers and practitioners working with ViTs.

The paper goes beyond simply debunking previous claims by introducing a novel backdoor attack, termed Channel Activation attack (CAT). This attack leverages the observation that existing backdoor triggers create noticeable differences in channel activations, which defenses can exploit. CAT mitigates this by adding adversarial perturbations to the trigger during training, effectively minimizing the activation discrepancies and enhancing the attack's resilience against defenses.  The effectiveness of CAT is demonstrated across various ViT architectures and datasets, including ImageNet, showcasing its potential as a strong baseline for future research.

The authors also analyze the limitations of directly applying pruning-based defenses like ANP and AWM to ViTs.  They propose modifications to the pruning granularity and location to improve their effectiveness.  This analysis contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the architectural considerations for backdoor defenses in ViTs.

While the paper convincingly demonstrates the improved robustness of ViTs with proper defenses and introduces a stronger attack, some areas could be further strengthened.  A more in-depth analysis of the transferability of CAT across different model sizes and datasets would be beneficial. Additionally, exploring the computational overhead introduced by CAT during training and the potential trade-offs with performance would enhance the paper's practical relevance.  Finally, a discussion of potential mitigations against CAT would be a valuable addition.

Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the understanding of backdoor attacks and defenses in ViTs.  The authors challenge existing assumptions, provide practical training recommendations, and introduce a novel attack that serves as a valuable benchmark for future research. This work has the potential to spur further investigations into the backdoor robustness of ViTs and contribute to the development of more secure and reliable ViT models. It is a well-written and insightful paper that deserves publication.  The comparison with recent work like Subramanya et al. (2022b) strengthens the paper's contribution.  While Dale et al. (2021) provides a broader context on backdoor attacks, this paper focuses specifically on ViTs, providing a focused and valuable contribution.
