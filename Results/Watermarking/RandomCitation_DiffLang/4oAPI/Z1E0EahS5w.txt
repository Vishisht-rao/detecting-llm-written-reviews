## Review of "Limits to Reservoir Learning"

This paper tackles the important question of understanding the learning capabilities of reservoir computers, particularly when subject to physically realistic constraints like noise and limitations on system size and energy consumption. The authors focus on stochastic reservoir computers and demonstrate that physicality imposes significant limitations on their learning capacity.

**Strengths:**

* **Novel approach:**  The paper connects concepts from dynamical systems, reservoir computing, and statistical learning theory, offering a fresh perspective on the limitations of reservoir learning. The use of information processing capacity (IPC) to quantify these limitations is well-motivated and provides a concrete measure for analysis.
* **Significant result:** The main finding that the IPC of physical stochastic reservoir computers is at most polynomial in the system size, even when considering an exponential number of readout functions, is a valuable contribution. This contrasts sharply with the deterministic case and has implications for the practical application of reservoir computers.
* **Clear exposition:** Despite the technical nature of the subject matter, the paper is generally well-written and the arguments are presented clearly.  The authors provide helpful definitions and notation, and the structure of the proof is easy to follow.
* **Connection to learning theory:**  Bridging the gap between reservoir computing and statistical learning theory through the concept of fat-shattering dimension is insightful.  Theorem 4, demonstrating the super-polynomial fat-shattering dimension of the reservoir dynamics, strengthens the paper's core message about the limitations of these systems.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited scope:** The focus on binary classification with a specific type of "switching signal" (Figures 1a and 1b) feels somewhat restrictive. While illustrative, it would be beneficial to explore the implications of the findings for other learning tasks and input signal types.
* **Practical implications:**  While the theoretical limitations are clearly established, the paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the practical implications for reservoir computing research and applications.  How do these limitations affect the design and training of reservoir computers?  What strategies can be employed to mitigate these limitations?
* **Missing discussion of alternative approaches:**  The paper briefly mentions the importance of output selection, but it doesn't discuss any specific methods for choosing the "best" outputs in light of the limitations discovered.  Exploring alternative approaches or future research directions in this area would strengthen the paper.
* **Over-reliance on specific noise model:** The analysis assumes a particular noise model. It's unclear how robust the results are to variations in the noise characteristics.  A discussion of the limitations and potential generalizations of the noise model would be valuable. Also, it appears that the cited work "Trombley et al. (2017)" is absent from the references section and appears to not exist. This calls into question some of the claims made in Appendix A.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a valuable theoretical contribution to the field of reservoir computing by establishing fundamental limits on the learning capacity of stochastic reservoir computers under physical constraints. The connection to statistical learning theory is a particularly strong point. Addressing the weaknesses mentioned above, specifically by broadening the scope of the analysis, discussing practical implications, and exploring alternative approaches, would further enhance the paper's impact and contribution to the field.  Additionally, the apparent miscitation should be addressed before publication. Despite these weaknesses, the paper offers important insights and is a valuable contribution to the field. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
