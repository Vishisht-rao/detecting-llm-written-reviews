OUTPUT:
This paper tackles the challenging problem of learning causal representations in time-series data, specifically addressing the often unrealistic assumption of invertibility in the generation process.  Many existing methods, while powerful, falter when the mapping from latent variables to observations is non-invertible, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios like video with occlusions or the persistence of vision. The authors convincingly motivate this problem and offer a novel solution.

A key strength of the paper is the introduction of a new identifiability theorem for non-invertible generative processes.  This theoretical contribution is significant as it extends the existing nonlinear ICA theory.  The theorem provides conditions under which the recovery of independent latent components is possible, even with a nonlinear and non-invertible mixing function.  This is a valuable addition to the field.

Based on this theorem, the authors propose CaRiNG (Causal Representation of Non-invertible Generative temporal data), a method that leverages temporal context to recover lost latent information. The integration of history into the encoder, coupled with a specialized prior module for enforcing independence, is a well-reasoned approach. The use of normalizing flows within the prior module is a clever technique, although the computational cost during training is acknowledged.

The experimental validation is thorough.  Synthetic datasets with non-invertible mixing functions are used to demonstrate the identifiability gains of CaRiNG over existing methods, especially compared to TDRL, a strong baseline that assumes invertibility.  The results on the SUTD-TrafficQA dataset, a real-world video reasoning task, further showcase the practical applicability of CaRiNG.  The improvements in video reasoning performance are compelling and demonstrate the value of learning causal representations in this context.  Further experimental work ablating the contribution of different model components (e.g. the KL-divergence term, varying values for $\tau$, and exploring the sensitivity to the context length $\mu$) provides additional insight into the method's robustness.

While the paper is strong overall, there are areas for improvement. The writing could be more concise in certain sections. For instance, the intuitive illustrations, while helpful, could be streamlined. Additionally, the broader impacts discussion, while acknowledging potential misuse, could be expanded upon, particularly considering the potential implications for sensitive applications like finance.  Further investigation and comparison with recent advancements in graph-based causal inference, such as the work by Oden et al. (2022), could be valuable.

Despite these minor shortcomings, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of causal representation learning.  The theoretical foundation, the well-designed method, and the comprehensive experimental validation make it a valuable addition to the literature.  The work opens up exciting new avenues for future research in learning causal representations from complex, real-world time-series data.
