Review of "Iteration and Stochastic First-Order Oracle Complexities of Stochastic Gradient Descent Using Constant and Decaying Learning Rates"

This paper addresses the important question of how batch size and learning rate interact to influence the iteration and stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexities of SGD for non-convex optimization, particularly in the context of deep learning. The authors motivate their work by highlighting the often-observed empirical phenomenon of diminishing returns with increasing batch sizes, and they aim to provide theoretical grounding for this observation.

Strengths:

* **Relevant Topic:**  Analyzing the complexities of SGD in the non-convex setting is crucial for understanding its practical performance in deep learning.  The interplay between batch size and learning rate is a key aspect that deserves careful theoretical investigation.
* **Clear Motivation:** The paper clearly lays out the motivation behind the work, referencing empirical observations and prior theoretical results.
* **Theoretical Analysis:** The core contribution lies in deriving upper bounds for the squared norm of the full gradient under different learning rate schedules (constant, decay, and step-decay). These bounds then lead to expressions for the iteration and SFO complexities.
* **Step-Decay Emphasis:**  The analysis highlights the potential benefits of step-decay learning rates, both theoretically and empirically.  This is a valuable contribution, as step-decay schedules are often used in practice but are less frequently analyzed theoretically compared to constant or continuously decaying rates.
* **Numerical Validation:** The authors provide numerical experiments that support their theoretical findings, comparing various learning rate schedules and optimizers on standard image classification datasets.

Weaknesses:

* **Limited Novelty:** While the focus on SFO complexity and the detailed analysis of step-decay are valuable, the core theoretical techniques employed seem largely based on standard optimization analysis.  The novelty of the derived bounds could be further emphasized and clarified.  A more thorough discussion of how the derived bounds compare to existing complexity results (e.g., those cited in the introduction) would strengthen the paper.
* **Assumptions:** The analysis relies on standard assumptions like smoothness and bounded variance. While reasonable, discussing the limitations of these assumptions and potential relaxations would be beneficial.
* **Clarity and Presentation:**  The paper could benefit from improved clarity in some sections. For example, the definition and justification of the "optimal batch size" could be presented more clearly. The transition between the theoretical analysis and the numerical results could also be smoother. Specifically, a clearer explanation of how the hyperparameters for the numerical experiments were chosen (beyond the mention of a grid search) is needed.
* **Overstated Claim (Spurious Citation):** The paper claims that the work of "Colston et al. (2014)" is referenced.  However, such a citation is not found in the bibliography. This raises concerns about the thoroughness of the literature review and requires clarification.
* **Limited Scope:**  As acknowledged by the authors, the analysis is specific to SGD. Extending the results to other popular optimizers (momentum, Adam, etc.) is an important direction for future work.

Overall:

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the theoretical understanding of SGD in the non-convex setting.  The focus on SFO complexity and the analysis of step-decay learning rates are particularly noteworthy.  Addressing the weaknesses related to novelty, clarity, the spurious citation, and scope would significantly strengthen the paper and broaden its impact.  Despite these weaknesses, the paper provides useful insights and serves as a good starting point for further research on this important topic.
