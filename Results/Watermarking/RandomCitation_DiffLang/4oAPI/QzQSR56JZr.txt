OUTPUT:
This paper tackles the challenging problem of generating complex yet recognizable pixel-based sketches, a domain where diffusion models have not been extensively explored.  While vector-based approaches dominate existing sketch generation literature, they struggle with the intricacies of complex sketches.  The authors cleverly leverage the power of diffusion models by introducing a novel scale-adaptive classifier-guided diffusion approach.  This avoids the limitations of fixed-scale classifier guidance, which often leads to either over-simplified or over-sketched results.  The proposed method dynamically optimizes the guidance scale at each timestep based on a scaling indicator and the concept of a residual sketch, striking a balance between recognizability and complexity.

The key strength of the paper lies in its innovative scale adaptation mechanism.  The scaling indicator, incorporating both complexity and recognizability measures, provides a dynamic signal to guide the generation process. The residual sketch, comparing generated sketches with and without guidance, offers a pixel-level view of the guidance's impact, enabling fine-tuned control.  The introduction of a three-phase sampling strategy, including a warm-up phase for enhanced diversity and a final denoising phase for improved quality, further strengthens the approach.

The experimental results on the QuickDraw dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.  The quantitative comparisons, using metrics like FID, precision, recall, and the novel CLIP-Score, show a clear advantage over existing vector-based and raster-based methods.  The qualitative results further confirm the ability to generate visually appealing and detailed sketches.  The ablation study provides valuable insights into the contributions of individual components and the impact of design choices. The supplementary figures showcasing the visualization of residual sketches and generated samples and captions further aid in understanding the process.

While the paper presents a strong contribution, a few areas could be further explored.  The scaling indicator, while effective, relies on heuristics for complexity and recognizability.  Investigating more robust and potentially learned measures could be beneficial.  Additionally, while the paper acknowledges the "over-sketching" phenomenon, a deeper analysis of its causes and potential mitigation strategies beyond scale adaptation could be valuable.  Finally, exploring the application of this method to other sketch datasets and more diverse sketch styles would further validate its generalizability.

Overall, this paper presents a novel and effective approach for complex sketch generation using diffusion models. The proposed scale-adaptive classifier guidance and three-phase sampling strategy contribute significantly to the field and offer a promising direction for future research.  The clarity of the presentation, thorough experimental evaluation, and insightful ablation study make this a valuable contribution to the generative AI community.
