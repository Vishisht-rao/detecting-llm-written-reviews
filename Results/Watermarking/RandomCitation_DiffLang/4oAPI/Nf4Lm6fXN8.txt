## Review of "Replay Across Experiments: A Natural Extension of Off-Policy RL"

This paper presents Replay across Experiments (RaE), a simple yet effective method for reusing experience data across multiple reinforcement learning (RL) experiments. The core idea is to augment the standard experience replay buffer with data from previous training runs, effectively bootstrapping learning and improving exploration in subsequent experiments.  The authors demonstrate the efficacy of RaE across a range of challenging domains, including locomotion, manipulation, and the RL Unplugged benchmark, and with several different off-policy RL algorithms (DMPO, D4PG, CRR, and SAC-X).

The simplicity of RaE is a significant strength.  It requires minimal changes to existing RL workflows, primarily involving the addition of a mechanism to load and mix prior data into the replay buffer. This ease of implementation makes it a readily adoptable technique for practitioners.  The experimental results are compelling, showing consistent performance gains compared to baselines like finetuning, AWAC, and random weight resetting.  The ablation studies further highlight the robustness of RaE to variations in data quantity, quality, and mixing ratio. Notably, the authors find that even small amounts of prior data and data from suboptimal policies can be beneficial.  Furthermore, as highlighted by Peebles et al. (2020), the iterative application of RaE, where data from each iteration is reused in the next, can lead to further performance improvements, suggesting a promising direction for lifelong learning.

While the empirical results are strong, the paper could benefit from a deeper analysis of *why* RaE works so well. The authors hypothesize that improved exploration and a richer dataset contribute to the performance gains. However, further investigation into the underlying mechanisms, such as analyzing the impact of RaE on the learned policy or value function representations, would strengthen the paper's contribution.  Additionally, the paper focuses on simulated environments.  Exploring the applicability of RaE in real-world robotics settings, where data collection is often more expensive and challenging, would be a valuable extension.

Despite these minor limitations, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the RL community. RaE is a simple, practical, and effective method for reusing experience data, with the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and performance of off-policy RL algorithms. The authors' focus on simplicity and broad applicability makes this work particularly relevant for practitioners looking to improve their RL workflows.  I recommend accepting this paper.
