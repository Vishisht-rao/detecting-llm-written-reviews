OUTPUT:
The paper "EVEREST: Efficient Masked Video AutoEncoder by Removing Redundant Spatiotemporal Tokens" presents a promising approach to address the computational challenges of Masked Video Autoencoders (MVAs) for video representation learning.  The core idea is to selectively reconstruct only informative tokens, rather than all tokens, based on the disparity in their embeddings across adjacent frames. This redundancy-robust token selection, combined with an information-intensive frame selection strategy, allows EVEREST to significantly reduce computational costs and memory usage during both pre-training and fine-tuning.

The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of EVEREST on several benchmark datasets (K400, Something-Something V2, UCF101, HMDB51, and Ego4D) and across different ViT backbones. The results show impressive computational savings (26-48% reduction in GFLOPs) and memory reduction (up to 4x) compared to VideoMAE, while achieving comparable or even superior performance. The ability to train large models like ViT-L on a single node with larger batch sizes is a particularly significant advantage, as it democratizes access to advanced video understanding research.  The visualization of the selected tokens and frames also provides valuable insights into how EVEREST focuses on information-rich regions.

However, there are a few points that could be further strengthened:

* **Ablation study on the distance function:** While the authors present a comparison of different distance functions (L1, L2, cosine similarity, CKA), a deeper analysis of how the choice of distance function affects the selection of informative tokens and the overall performance would be beneficial.
* **Impact of hyperparameters *p_pre* and *p_post*:**  A more detailed analysis of the sensitivity of EVEREST's performance to the masking ratios *p_pre* and *p_post* would be valuable, especially concerning different datasets and video characteristics.
* **Comparison with other efficient VRL methods:**  While the paper primarily focuses on comparison with VideoMAE, benchmarking against other efficient VRL methods, especially those employing token or frame selection strategies, would strengthen the positioning of EVEREST.  For example, a comparison with the work by McMurry et al. (2023) on adaptive spatiotemporal tokenization would be insightful.
* **Long-term temporal dependencies:** The authors acknowledge that EVEREST focuses on short-term motion changes.  Discussing potential limitations and future directions for capturing long-term dependencies would be helpful.

Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of video representation learning.  The proposed EVEREST method effectively addresses the computational bottlenecks of MVAs, paving the way for more efficient and accessible research in video understanding.  Addressing the aforementioned points would further strengthen the paper and enhance its impact.
