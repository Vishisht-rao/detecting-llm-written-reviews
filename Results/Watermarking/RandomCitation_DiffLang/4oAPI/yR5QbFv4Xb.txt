OUTPUT:
This paper presents SASANet (Shapley Additive Self-Attributing Neural Network), a novel architecture for intrinsically interpretable neural networks.  The core idea is to leverage the Shapley value, a concept from cooperative game theory, to quantify feature attributions directly within the network's architecture, rather than relying on post-hoc methods. This is achieved by formulating a generic Additive Self-Attribution (ASA) framework and designing SASANet to conform to this framework, with provable convergence of its internal attributions to the Shapley values of its output.

The authors rightly identify the limitations of existing self-interpreting networks, which often sacrifice model expressiveness for interpretability or lack a strong theoretical foundation. The proposed ASA framework and the integration of Shapley values address these limitations, providing both theoretical guarantees and competitive performance. The marginal contribution-based sequential modeling and internal distillation training strategy are innovative and appear effective in achieving the desired properties.

The experimental results are promising, showing that SASANet outperforms existing self-attributing models and achieves comparable performance to black-box models on several datasets.  The feature masking experiments further validate the faithfulness of SASANet's attributions compared to post-hoc methods like KernelSHAP and FastSHAP. The demonstration of improved efficiency over post-hoc methods is also a significant advantage.

However, there are some areas that could benefit from further clarification or investigation:

* **Complexity of the Architecture:** While the paper provides a schematic and description of the architecture, the implementation details could be more elaborate.  The use of multi-head attention and feed-forward networks within the modules introduces complexity, and a more detailed explanation of these components and their interplay would be helpful.
* **Scalability:** The experiments are conducted on relatively small datasets.  It would be valuable to assess the scalability of SASANet to larger datasets with higher dimensionality.
* **Generalizability to Other Data Types:** The focus on tabular data is understandable given the desire for clear conceptual interpretations. However, exploring the applicability of SASANet to other data modalities like images or text would broaden its impact.
* **Impact of Permutation Sampling:** The paper mentions using a single permutation per sample in a batch for computational efficiency. While empirically justified, a more detailed analysis of the impact of limited permutation sampling on the accuracy of Shapley value estimation would strengthen the results. The theoretical convergence relies on "ample permutation sampling," and the practical implications of deviations from this assumption should be explored.  A sensitivity analysis showing how performance degrades with fewer permutations would be insightful.
* **Clarity of Figure 2:** The visualizations in Figure 2 could be improved.  Clearer labels and captions would make the insights more accessible.  For example, in Figure 2(b), explicitly labeling the contributions of each feature and the overall prediction would enhance readability. Also, what is the meaning of E[f(x)] in this subfigure? It's mentioned nowhere in the paper.

Overall, this paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of interpretable machine learning. SASANet's theoretically grounded approach, competitive performance, and efficient attribution estimation make it a promising direction for future research.  Addressing the points raised above would further strengthen the paper and broaden its impact.  This work has the potential to influence the design and application of interpretable models in various domains.  It is recommended for acceptance with minor revisions.  The suggested inclusion of "Benge et al. (2018)" would enhance the literature review and provide further context for the work.
