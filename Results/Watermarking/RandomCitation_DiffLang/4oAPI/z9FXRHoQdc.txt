Review of "Best Response Shaping"

This paper introduces Best Response Shaping (BRS), a novel algorithm for multi-agent reinforcement learning in partially competitive environments.  Motivated by the limitations of existing methods like LOLA and POLA, which are susceptible to exploitation by sophisticated opponents, BRS trains an agent by differentiating through a "detective" opponent. This detective approximates the best response policy against the agent, encouraging the learning of reciprocal cooperative strategies.

The core idea of training against an approximation of the best response is compelling. The authors demonstrate the vulnerability of POLA to exploitation by a best-response opponent (approximated by MCTS) in the Coin Game, providing a clear motivation for their approach. The introduction of a state-aware differentiable conditioning mechanism using a question-answering (QA) system is a noteworthy contribution, allowing the detective to effectively condition on the agent's policy in complex games.  The empirical results in both the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) and the Coin Game offer promising evidence for the effectiveness of BRS, showcasing its ability to learn cooperative policies that are robust to exploitation.  Specifically, the results demonstrating that the best response to a BRS agent is full cooperation, unlike POLA, are particularly compelling.  The ablation studies regarding the replay buffer and self-play components provide further insights into the workings of the algorithm.  The connection drawn between self-play and self-play with reward sharing is also theoretically interesting.

However, the paper could be improved in several aspects.  The explanation of the QA mechanism could benefit from further clarification. While the general idea is presented, the specific implementation details and design choices could be elaborated upon.  Additionally, the paper primarily focuses on two-player games.  While the authors acknowledge the limitations of extending BRS to multi-player scenarios, a more detailed discussion of the challenges and potential avenues for future research in this direction would strengthen the paper. A more thorough comparison with other related works, such as those mentioned in Section 3, would be beneficial.  For example, while PSRO is mentioned, a deeper discussion of the key differences and advantages of BRS compared to PSRO would enhance the paper.  Furthermore, exploring the sensitivity of BRS to different hyperparameter settings, especially those related to the detective training and QA mechanism, would add to the completeness of the evaluation.

Despite these limitations, the paper presents a novel and promising approach to multi-agent reinforcement learning in partially competitive environments. The core idea of shaping the agent's policy through a best-response opponent is insightful, and the empirical results are encouraging.  The proposed state-aware conditioning mechanism using a QA system is a valuable contribution to the field.  Addressing the mentioned limitations, particularly regarding the clarity of the QA mechanism and the extension to multi-player scenarios, would further strengthen the paper's impact.


Minor comments:

* Some figures (e.g., Figure 3) could be made more visually clear.
* The connection between ZD extortion and its importance to the bigger picture of social welfare could be explained more explicitly. Hartsell et al. (2014) highlight its significance in real-world scenarios.


Overall, this paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of multi-agent reinforcement learning and deserves further attention.  I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
