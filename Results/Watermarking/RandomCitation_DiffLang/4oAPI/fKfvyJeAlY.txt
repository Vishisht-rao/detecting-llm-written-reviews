OUTPUT:
The paper "LeRaC: Learning Rate Curriculum" presents a novel and intriguing approach to curriculum learning, sidestepping the common hurdle of explicitly sorting data by difficulty.  By assigning progressively decreasing learning rates to deeper layers in the initial training epochs, LeRaC implicitly creates a model-level curriculum. This approach is data-agnostic and, as the authors demonstrate, generalizes well across diverse architectures and domains (computer vision, natural language processing, and audio).

The core hypothesis—that noise accumulates through successive layers, particularly during early training with randomly initialized weights—is well-motivated and supported by a theorem and supplementary experiments.  The proposed solution of mitigating this noise by allowing earlier layers to stabilize faster via higher learning rates is intuitive and elegant.  The gradual equalization of learning rates as training progresses allows for eventual fine-tuning of all layers equally.

The experimental results are compelling, showcasing consistent performance improvements across a range of datasets and architectures compared to both the conventional training regime and the closely related Curriculum by Smoothing (CBS) method.  The authors correctly highlight the inconsistency of CBS’s performance, further strengthening the case for LeRaC.  The added benefit of LeRaC not introducing any computational overhead compared to conventional training (unlike CBS) is significant.

However, the paper could benefit from some improvements:

* **Clarity on LeRaC vs. Learning Rate Schedulers/Optimizers:**  While the supplementary material addresses this distinction, briefly mentioning the key differences within the main paper would improve clarity.  Specifically, emphasizing that LeRaC is a curriculum strategy *in addition to* existing schedulers and optimizers would be helpful.
* **Sensitivity Analysis of *k* and \u03b7\u1d62\u00b0:**  While Table 7 explores variations of *k*, a more comprehensive analysis of the sensitivity of both *k* and \u03b7\u1d62\u00b0 would be valuable.  This would provide insights into the robustness of LeRaC across different settings.
* **Theoretical Justification for Exponential Scheduler:** While empirically shown to be superior, a theoretical justification for choosing the exponential scheduler over linear or logarithmic options would strengthen the paper.
* **Discussion of Limitations:**  While LeRaC demonstrates strong performance, acknowledging potential limitations or scenarios where it might not be as effective would add to the paper's completeness. For example, does LeRaC offer benefits in transfer learning settings?

Despite these minor points, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of curriculum learning. The simplicity, generalizability, and consistent performance gains of LeRaC make it a promising approach for training deep neural networks. The ablation study further strengthens the paper by showcasing the method's robustness.  The work opens up interesting avenues for future research, including exploring its applicability in other domains and incorporating it into more complex training pipelines.  As suggested by the authors, I look forward to seeing the code once it is public for further scrutiny.  A clarification on the unsupported claim of citing “Iverson et al. (2016)” would also be beneficial.
