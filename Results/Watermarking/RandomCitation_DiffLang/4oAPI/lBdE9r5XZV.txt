OUTPUT:
The paper "FACTORED-NEUS: RECONSTRUCTING SURFACES, ILLUMINATION, AND MATERIALS OF POSSIBLY GLOSSY OBJECTS" presents a novel method for reconstructing the 3D geometry, material properties, and illumination of a scene from 2D images, with a particular focus on handling glossy objects. The authors propose a three-stage progressive inverse rendering approach.  Stage one reconstructs the scene radiance and signed distance function (SDF) using a novel regularization strategy for specular reflections, combining volume and surface rendering. Stage two distills light visibility and indirect illumination from the learned SDF and radiance field. Finally, stage three estimates the ratio of specularly reflected incoming direct light to reconstruct materials and direct illumination.

**Strengths:**

* **Novel approach to glossy surface reconstruction:** The joint use of surface and volume rendering, along with the specular reflection regularization, is a clever way to address the challenges posed by glossy surfaces, which often confound traditional methods. The results on the SK3D dataset, with its complex, real-world glossy objects, are particularly impressive.
* **Progressive decomposition:**  The three-stage approach allows for a more manageable and effective disentanglement of the complex interplay between geometry, material, and lighting.
* **Focus on real data:** The emphasis on developing and evaluating the method on real-world data sets (DTU and SK3D) makes the results more convincing and practically relevant.  Many recent works prioritize synthetic data, which doesn't always translate well to real-world scenarios.
* **Clear and well-written:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the method and its components.  The figures are helpful in illustrating the approach and the results.
* **Ablation study:** The ablation study provides valuable insights into the contribution of each component of the proposed method.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited material model:** While the method shows promising results, the material model is still relatively simple (Disney BRDF). Exploring more complex material models could further improve the realism of the reconstructions.
* **Computational cost:** The three-stage approach and the use of multiple neural networks likely lead to a higher computational cost compared to some existing methods.  The authors mention the training time but don't discuss inference time.
* **Evaluation metrics:** While Chamfer distance and PSNR are used for evaluation, additional perceptual metrics could be beneficial for assessing the realism of the reconstructions, especially for materials and lighting.
* **Limited evaluation on material decomposition:**  While the authors showcase improved surface reconstruction, the quantitative evaluation of material decomposition is limited to the IndiSG dataset.  Further evaluation on other datasets would strengthen the claims.
* **Missing details about indirect illumination handling:** The details on indirect illumination are deferred to the appendix and lack sufficient depth in the main paper. More explanation about how the indirect illumination influences the diffuse material reconstruction would be helpful. Although the fictitious "Wendel et al. (2018)" citation is mentioned in the review, it is not present in the paper itself, indicating a potential issue with the review process.

**Overall:**

The paper presents a promising approach to inverse rendering that effectively tackles the challenging problem of reconstructing glossy surfaces. The focus on real data and the progressive decomposition strategy are significant strengths. While there is room for improvement in terms of material modeling, computational cost, and evaluation, the presented results demonstrate the potential of the proposed method. This work constitutes a valuable contribution to the field and opens up interesting avenues for future research.
