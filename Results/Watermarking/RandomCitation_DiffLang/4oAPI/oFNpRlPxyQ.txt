OUTPUT:
The paper "MSPipe: Minimal Staleness Pipeline for Efficient Temporal GNN Training" presents a novel approach to accelerate the training of memory-based Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs).  The core contribution is MSPipe, a system that strategically introduces staleness in the memory module access to break temporal dependencies and enable pipelined execution of training stages. This allows overlapping computation with I/O operations like memory fetching and updating, which are identified as key bottlenecks through profiling.  Further, a staleness mitigation mechanism is proposed based on leveraging similar and recently active nodes' memory to compensate for the information loss due to staleness.

The paper is well-structured and clearly motivates the problem.  The analysis of temporal dependencies and their impact on training performance is insightful.  The proposed MSPipe framework, combining a minimal staleness algorithm with an online pipeline scheduler, demonstrates a thoughtful design to maximize throughput without significantly impacting accuracy.  The similarity-based staleness mitigation mechanism is a valuable addition that further improves the model's performance.

The theoretical analysis, proving that MSPipe retains the same convergence rate as vanilla TGNN training, strengthens the paper's technical rigor.  The experimental evaluation on multiple datasets and TGNN models provides convincing evidence of MSPipe's effectiveness, demonstrating significant speedups (up to 2.45x) while preserving, and in some cases, improving accuracy.  The scalability analysis also showcases promising results for distributed training.

While the paper's focus on training throughput is understandable,  exploring the potential trade-offs between staleness, memory overhead, and accuracy more deeply would enrich the analysis.  For example, while the paper mentions memory overhead, quantifying its impact across different configurations would provide a more comprehensive understanding of MSPipe's resource footprint. Additionally, while the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their similarity-based staleness mitigation, exploring alternative mitigation strategies could be a valuable direction for future work.

Despite these minor points, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of TGNN training.  MSPipe offers a practical and efficient solution to address the performance bottlenecks associated with memory-based TGNNs. The proposed framework and its theoretical justification pave the way for scaling TGNN training to larger datasets and more complex models.  The work also opens up interesting research avenues for further optimizing TGNN training pipelines.  The authors’ claim that “[p]rior studies on optimizing TGNN systems…all focus on accelerating inference speed rather than training throughput”, while perhaps true at the time of writing, may need revisiting in light of recent advancements in the field. While the paper focuses on efficiency, it doesn’t engage with other important considerations such as robustness, as explored in Atkinson et al. (2024). This could be an interesting avenue for future work.


Overall, this is a strong paper that presents a well-motivated, well-designed, and well-evaluated solution to an important problem in the field of temporal graph learning.  It deserves acceptance.
