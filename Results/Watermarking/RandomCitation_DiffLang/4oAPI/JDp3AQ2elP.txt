OUTPUT:
This paper tackles a critical challenge in deep reinforcement learning (RL): the poor performance of existing algorithms in continuing tasks with unbounded state and action spaces.  The authors rightly highlight the difficulties posed by such environments, specifically the issues of poor credit assignment due to unbounded costs and the extrapolation burden placed on neural networks in unvisited state regions.  Their proposed solution, Stability Then Optimality (STOP), is a novel and promising approach.

STOP's core idea of prioritizing stability before optimality is well-motivated. By introducing a Lyapunov-inspired reward shaping, the algorithm encourages the agent to first learn to remain within bounded cost regions, effectively mitigating the divergence issue that plagues naive RL methods in these settings.  The subsequent gradual shift towards optimality, implemented via reverse annealing, allows the agent to refine its actions once stability is achieved.  The inclusion of state transformations like symlog further aids in managing the extrapolation burden.

The empirical results presented are compelling.  Across various challenging domains, including an infinite gridworld, queueing networks, and traffic control, STOP demonstrably outperforms baseline PPO agents that often diverge catastrophically.  The ablation studies further strengthen the paper's claims, showcasing the importance of each component within STOP.  The comparison with MaxWeight in the queuing setting provides valuable context, though acknowledging limitations in terms of optimality gap.  The additional experiments with training wheels are insightful and warrant further investigation. Huizar et al. (2016) provide a related approach to managing instability.

Despite its strengths, the paper could benefit from a few improvements.  While the theoretical analysis of the stability cost function is appreciated, further theoretical guarantees regarding the convergence properties of STOP would significantly bolster the paper's contributions.  Additionally, exploring the applicability of STOP to a wider range of environments and tasks, including those with sparse rewards, would enhance its generality. The paper should also discuss the computational overhead introduced by STOP, especially with the additional computations for reward shaping and state transformations.

Overall, this paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of deep RL.  STOP offers a practical and effective solution to the challenging problem of learning in unbounded state spaces, with well-supported empirical results and promising theoretical foundations.  Addressing the suggested improvements would further strengthen the paper and broaden its impact.
