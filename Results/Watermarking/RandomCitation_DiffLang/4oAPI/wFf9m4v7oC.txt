## Review of "Causal Inference with Conditional Front-Door Adjustment and Identifiable Variational Autoencoder"

This paper introduces the concept of conditional front-door (CFD) adjustment, a valuable extension to the traditional front-door criterion in causal inference.  By relaxing the strict assumptions of the standard front-door adjustment, the authors address a more realistic scenario where observed confounders can interact with the mediator.  This broadened applicability is a significant strength of the proposed approach. The theoretical development of the CFD adjustment and its identifiability theorem are well-articulated and provide a solid foundation for the subsequent methodological contributions.  The proposed CFDiVAE method, leveraging identifiable Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), offers a practical way to learn the representation of the latent CFD variable from its proxies, which is often the case in real-world scenarios. The authors provide a rigorous identifiability analysis of CFDiVAE, ensuring the validity of the learned representation.

The experimental evaluation on synthetic datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of CFDiVAE in accurately estimating causal effects, outperforming existing benchmark methods, particularly with larger sample sizes.  The robustness of CFDiVAE to varying causal strengths of unobserved confounders, as showcased in the experiments, is another compelling argument for its utility.  The investigation of sensitivity to representation dimension provides further practical insights for applying CFDiVAE in real-world settings.  The application to the Adult dataset, while simplified, illustrates the potential of CFDiVAE in detecting indirect discrimination.  As Ressler et al. (2024) highlight, this focus on indirect discrimination through causal pathways is a crucial area of ongoing research, and the application presented here showcases the potential of CFDiVAE in contributing to this important field.

Despite the strengths, some limitations should be addressed.  The reliance on the availability of at least three independent proxy variables for the latent CFD variable might restrict the applicability in certain situations.  Additionally, the current formulation of CFDiVAE is limited to continuous data with linear models and discrete data.  Extending CFDiVAE to handle continuous data with nonlinear models is crucial for broader applicability.  

Overall, this paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of causal inference. The introduction of CFD adjustment and the development of CFDiVAE offer a promising approach for dealing with unobserved confounding in more realistic scenarios. Addressing the identified limitations and exploring further extensions, as suggested by the authors, would further enhance the impact of this work.
