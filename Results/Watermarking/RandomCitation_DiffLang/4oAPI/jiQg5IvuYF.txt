## Review of "CORGI²: A Hybrid Offline-Online Approach to Storage-Aware Data Shuffling for SGD"

This paper introduces Corgi², a novel two-step data shuffling algorithm designed to address the performance bottlenecks of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) when dealing with large, sharded datasets in cloud storage environments.  The core idea is to combine an offline iteration of the existing CorgiPile algorithm with a subsequent online iteration, aiming to strike a balance between data access efficiency and model convergence speed.

**Strengths:**

* **Novel Approach:** The hybrid offline-online shuffling strategy is a valuable contribution to the growing body of work on efficient data shuffling for SGD. The authors convincingly argue for its potential to bridge the gap between purely online methods like CorgiPile and the computationally expensive full offline shuffle.
* **Theoretical Analysis:** The paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of Corgi²'s convergence properties. Theorem 1 demonstrates the reduction in block-wise variance achieved by the offline shuffling step, while Theorem 2 establishes the resulting improvement in the convergence rate. The analysis, although complex, is clearly presented and provides valuable insights.
* **Empirical Validation:** The experimental results on ImageNet and a proprietary 27TB dataset are encouraging, showcasing Corgi²'s ability to achieve performance comparable to full shuffling while maintaining significantly better data access efficiency.  The exploration of the trade-off between block size and buffer size is also insightful.
* **Practical Relevance:** The problem addressed by this paper is highly relevant to modern machine learning practices, where massive datasets are increasingly common and often stored in cloud environments.  Corgi² offers a practical solution to the significant data access challenges posed by such scenarios.

**Weaknesses:**

* **CIFAR-100 Results:** The performance on CIFAR-100 is less convincing, with Corgi² failing to match the accuracy of full shuffling. The authors attribute this to the small buffer size relative to the number of classes, leading to class imbalance within the buffers. This explanation is plausible, but further investigation is needed to fully understand the limitations of Corgi² in such scenarios.  Perhaps exploring different buffer management strategies could mitigate this issue.
* **Storage Overhead:** The paper acknowledges the potential for increased storage costs with the naive implementation of Corgi². While an in-place variant is mentioned, its lack of theoretical analysis leaves some open questions regarding its convergence properties.  Providing a more thorough analysis of the in-place variant would strengthen the paper.
* **Comparison to Related Work:**  While the paper mentions several related works, a more direct empirical comparison to these methods (e.g., MRS, Nguyen et al. (2022), and the Tensorflow sliding window shuffle) would further highlight Corgi²'s advantages.  Additionally,  the connection to the card shuffling analysis in Nestoridi & White (2016) could be explored further.
* **Missing citation:**  The paper seems to allude to related work by "Swaney et al. (2014)"  when discussing online shuffling methods, but this citation is missing from the bibliography.  Including this reference would complete the context for the reader.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a promising new approach to data shuffling for SGD, with a solid theoretical foundation and encouraging empirical results on large datasets. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above, particularly regarding the CIFAR-100 performance and the in-place variant, would significantly strengthen the paper and increase its impact.  Despite these minor shortcomings, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field and is worthy of publication.
