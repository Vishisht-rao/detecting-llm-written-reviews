This paper delves into the formal language recognition capabilities of transformer encoders, specifically focusing on Unique Hard Attention Transformers (UHATs) and Average Hard Attention Transformers (AHATs).  The authors make several significant contributions to our understanding of these architectures.

A key strength is the paper's exploration of the boundaries of UHAT expressiveness. While prior work established that UHATs recognize languages within the circuit complexity class AC⁰, this paper demonstrates that the inclusion is strict: not all AC⁰ languages are recognized by UHATs.  This is an important negative result that refines our understanding of UHAT limitations.

On the positive side, the authors identify a substantial fragment of AC⁰, namely languages definable in first-order logic with unary numerical predicates (FO(Mon)), that *are* recognizable by UHATs. This is achieved through a clever application of Kamp's Theorem, translating FO(Mon) formulas into equivalent Linear Temporal Logic (LTL(Mon)) formulas and then showing that UHATs can realize these LTL(Mon) formulas.  This result is quite powerful as FO(Mon) encompasses all regular languages within AC⁰, exceeding the expressiveness of standard first-order logic over words.

The paper also extends its analysis to AHATs, demonstrating that they can recognize languages beyond AC⁰.  By introducing an extended logic, LTL(C, +), which incorporates counting terms, the authors prove that AHATs can recognize all languages definable in this logic. This implies AHATs can recognize languages like majority and parity, which are not in AC⁰, showcasing their enhanced counting capabilities.  Furthermore, this leads to the interesting corollary that AHATs can recognize permutation closures of regular languages, a class that includes non-context-free languages.

The use of formal language theory and circuit complexity provides a rigorous framework for analyzing the expressiveness of these architectures.  The paper is well-written and clearly presents its technical contributions.  The connections drawn between logic, automata theory, and transformer encoders are particularly insightful.  Furthermore, the work is nicely complemented by recent results on masked hard-attention from Angluin et al. (2023), highlighting the impact of positional encodings on expressiveness.

However, the reliance on Kamp's theorem, while elegant, might obscure the intuitive connection between FO(Mon) and UHATs.  A more direct construction could further illuminate how UHATs process unary numerical predicates.  Additionally, while the paper addresses counting properties of regular languages recognizable by UHATs and AHATs, exploring counting properties of *non-regular* languages could be a fruitful direction for future research.  Finally, investigating the learning implications of these results—how efficiently can UHATs and AHATs learn languages in FO(Mon) and LTL(C, +), respectively?—would be valuable.

Overall, this paper makes significant contributions to our theoretical understanding of transformer encoders, offering valuable insights into their capabilities and limitations. It lays a strong foundation for future work on the formal language recognition power of these increasingly important architectures.
