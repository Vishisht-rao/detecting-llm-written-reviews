OUTPUT:
This paper tackles the crucial yet under-explored problem of Adaptable Error Detection (AED) for Few-Shot Imitation (FSI) policies operating in novel environments. The core challenge is identifying deviations from demonstrated behavior in unseen settings, a critical safety concern for real-world FSI deployment. The authors convincingly argue that existing anomaly detection methods fall short due to the unique challenges of AED: (1) operating in novel environments, (2) lack of explicit error signals, and (3) the need for online detection.

The proposed solution, Pattern Observer (PrObe), offers a compelling approach by focusing on learned patterns within the feature representations of the FSI policy itself. This leverages task-specific knowledge encoded in the policy's internal representations, enabling error detection even in novel environments. The use of a pattern flow and fusion with task embeddings further addresses the temporal aspects and task consistency challenges.

The experimental setup is thorough, involving seven challenging multi-stage FSI tasks with numerous variations in environment and objects.  PrObe consistently outperforms a set of baseline methods across different FSI policies, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.  The ablation studies and timing accuracy analysis provide further insights into the contributions of PrObe's components.  The visualization of learned embeddings showcases the interpretability of PrObe, highlighting task progress and state clustering.  The pilot study on error correction offers a glimpse into the practical implications of AED.

However, the paper has some limitations:

* **Offline evaluation:** While the ultimate goal is online error detection, the main evaluation uses offline collected rollouts.  Though the timing accuracy experiment addresses this partially, a more comprehensive online evaluation would strengthen the claims.
* **Lack of real-world or benchmark evaluation:** The authors justify the creation of new FSI tasks due to limitations of existing benchmarks. However, comparing against established anomaly detection benchmarks, even with adaptations, would provide additional context.
* **Limited error correction study:** The pilot study on error correction is preliminary and lacks detailed analysis of different correction strategies and their limitations.

Despite these limitations, the paper makes a significant contribution by formalizing the AED problem and proposing a novel solution that outperforms existing approaches.  The comprehensive experimental evaluation and ablation studies provide strong evidence for PrObe's effectiveness. The work opens up exciting avenues for future research in online error detection, robust error correction, and ultimately safer deployment of FSI policies in real-world scenarios.  The clarity of presentation and comprehensive analysis of the problem and proposed solution make this a valuable contribution to the FSI and robotics community.


Specific suggestions for improvement:

* **Strengthen the online evaluation:** Design experiments that explicitly evaluate PrObe's performance in a true online setting.
* **Expand the error correction study:** Explore more sophisticated error correction strategies and analyze their performance in different scenarios.
* **Consider adapting existing anomaly detection benchmarks:** Explore how existing benchmarks could be modified to evaluate AED and provide comparisons with more established methods in anomaly detection.


Overall, this is a strong paper that addresses an important problem with a novel and effective solution. The work is well-motivated, clearly presented, and thoroughly evaluated. The limitations are acknowledged and provide directions for future work.  This paper deserves acceptance at ICLR 2024.
