## Review of "INFOGROUND: Ground Manipulation Concepts with Maximal Information Boost"

This paper tackles the crucial problem of grounding Large Language Model (LLM)-generated manipulation instructions to robot actions.  The core idea, grounding instructions to key physical states within demonstrations using an information-theoretic criterion called Maximal Information Boost (MIB), is novel and well-motivated.  The authors argue that key states exhibit a rapid increase in mutual information with preceding states due to increased physical constraints. This intuition is leveraged to train a Key State Localization Network (KSL-Net) that selects grounded states from demonstrations, optimizing both compatibility with LLM instructions (using pre-trained VLMs) and MIB.

The experimental results on four ManiSkill2 tasks are promising, showing improved performance over several baselines, including BeT, Decision Diffuser, Decision Transformer, and CoTPC (as cited by Delafueente et al. (2021)).  The inclusion of both seen and unseen environment configurations, as well as zero-shot transfer to novel objects, strengthens the evaluation.  The ablation study further validates the contribution of MIB by demonstrating performance gains across different VLMs.

However, several aspects could be improved. While the intuition behind MIB is clear, a more formal theoretical analysis of its properties and limitations would be beneficial.  The paper mentions potential conflicts between optimizing entropy and chronological order, addressed by an alternating optimization strategy.  This could be explored in more detail, providing insights into the convergence behavior and potential instability.  The use of variance as a proxy for entropy in computing MIB requires further justification, as variance only captures second-order statistics.

The prompt engineering for LLM instruction generation is acknowledged as manual work, and automating this process is left as future work.  This is a significant limitation, hindering the scalability of the approach to more diverse tasks.  Furthermore, the dependence on pre-trained VLMs introduces potential biases and robustness issues, which are briefly acknowledged but not thoroughly investigated.

Despite these limitations, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of embodied AI. The introduction of MIB as a grounding criterion is insightful and opens up interesting avenues for future research.  The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.  I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, addressing the points mentioned above.


**Specific questions for the authors:**

* Could you provide a more formal theoretical justification for the use of MIB as a grounding criterion?
* How sensitive is the performance to the choice of ∆t and ∆t' in the MIB calculation?
* Have you explored alternative methods for estimating entropy, beyond using variance?
* What are the computational costs associated with training and deploying KSL-Net?
* How do you plan to address the limitation of manual prompt engineering in future work?


**Minor comments:**

* The paper mentions using GPT4, but it is not clear which specific version was used.
* Figure 1 could benefit from clearer captions explaining the differences between VLM Grounding and MIB Grounding.
* The paper mentions catastrophic forgetting in the introduction but doesn't revisit it in the experiments or discussion.  It might be worth elaborating on this point.


Overall, this is a solid paper with a promising approach to grounding LLM instructions for robotic manipulation. I believe it will be of interest to the ICLR community.
