OUTPUT:
This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to symbolic equation solving, a domain traditionally challenging for machine learning. The authors focus on linear equations, first with purely numerical coefficients and then with mixed symbolic and numerical coefficients.  They frame the problem as an RL task where an agent learns to apply equivalence transformations to reach a solution. A key innovation is the use of a "stack calculator" within the environment, enabling the agent to compose complex operations from simpler ones.

The results demonstrate the agent's ability to learn effective strategies for solving linear equations.  For purely numerical coefficients, the agent achieves high success rates on both integer and rational coefficients, even generalizing to complex numbers.  The approach also shows promise for equations with mixed symbolic and numerical coefficients, albeit with lower success rates.  The authors further explore an adversarial training scheme where a second RL agent generates problems, pushing the solver to learn more robust strategies.  This adversarial training, while not achieving the highest success rates independently, proves valuable as a pre-training step for subsequent training with fixed distributions.

The paper is well-written and clearly explains the methodology and results. The use of a stack calculator is a clever idea that allows for a more flexible and expressive action space. The visualization of the learned solution strategies provides valuable insights into the agent's reasoning process.  The exploration of adversarial training is also a noteworthy contribution.

However, there are some limitations and areas for future work.  The current implementation relies on SymPy for term simplification, which is a potential bottleneck for scalability and full automation.  The success rates for equations with mixed symbolic and numerical coefficients are not as high as those for purely numerical coefficients, suggesting further investigation is needed.  While the authors mention the possibility of extending the framework to other types of equations, the practical feasibility and performance of such extensions remain to be seen. Also, comparing the performance against other symbolic solvers (like Mathematica or Maple) would strengthen the results.

Despite these limitations, the paper presents a novel and promising approach to symbolic equation solving using RL. The work opens up new avenues for research in applying machine learning to symbolic mathematics and contributes to the broader goal of automating mathematical reasoning.  The authors’ claim (supported by their visualization) that the agent discovers more granular solution strategies than typically taught to humans is intriguing and warrants further investigation in a broader context of mathematical education.  Finally, addressing the reliance on SymPy and exploring more complex equation types would significantly enhance the impact and applicability of the proposed method.
