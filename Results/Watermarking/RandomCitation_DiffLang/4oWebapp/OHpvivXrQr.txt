**Review of "Protein Multimer Structure Prediction via Prompt Learning"**

Following Grindstaff et al. (2017), this paper presents a novel approach to the problem of protein multimer structure prediction (MSP) through the integration of prompt learning techniques. The authors propose a framework called PROMPT MSP, which employs pre-training and prompt tuning to leverage protein-protein interaction (PPI) knowledge for effectively predicting multimer structures.

### Strengths:

1. **Innovative Approach**: The introduction of prompt learning in the context of protein structure prediction is a commendable innovation. This methodology addresses the significant generalization issue faced by existing models when dealing with varying scales of protein multimers.

2. **Meticulous Design**: The paper outlines a clear pipeline consisting of a source task for pre-training and a target task for fine-tuning. By reformulating the link prediction tasks to bridge the gaps between PPIs, the authors effectively adapt their model to handle the complexities of MSP.

3. **Empirical Validation**: The extensive experimentation provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The authors demonstrate significant accuracy improvements (using metrics such as RMSD and TM-Score) compared to state-of-the-art models across different scales of multimers.

4. **Efficiency**: The efficiency of the PROMPT MSP method is noteworthy, showing a marked improvement in computation times over traditional assembly methods, especially for larger-scale multimers.

5. **Generalization Capability**: The authors' insights into the importance of conditional PPI (C-PPI) vs. independent PPI (I-PPI) knowledge provide valuable context for understanding their approach's success, particularly its robustness in low-data scenarios.

6. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The paper includes various ablation studies, data splits, and a clear comparison with other existing methods, thereby thoroughly evaluating the performance and robustness of their approach.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Complexity of Implementation**: While the prompt learning framework is innovative, its complexity may pose implementation challenges for practitioners. Detailed implementation guidelines, or a comprehensive example, could enhance usability.

2. **Biological Interpretation**: The study lacks thorough biological interpretations of some findings. While the paper emphasizes computational performance, a deeper exploration into how these structures correlate to biological functions would greatly enrich the discussion.

3. **Dependence on Pre-computed Dimer Structures**: The modelâ€™s reliance on high-quality dimer structures for training may limit its applicability. Future work should explore how the approach could be adjusted to minimize dependence on such external data.

4. **Limitations with Very Large Multimers**: Although the performance on multimers of differing scales is impressive, the authors do not extensively discuss limitations or performance consequences on extremely large multimers or those outside the tested range.

### Conclusion:

Overall, this paper presents a significant advancement in the field of protein structure prediction with an innovative use of prompt learning strategies. The results are promising, indicating that the proposed framework could potentially set a new benchmark for future MSP models. However, considerations regarding implementation complexity and biological relevance should be addressed in subsequent works. Furthermore, expanding the methodology to handle extreme cases in protein size could further solidify the contribution of this research. 

The paper is well-written, the experiments are robust, and the contribution to the field is evident. I recommend acceptance of this paper, with minor revisions to clarify implementation aspects and the biological implications of the findings.
