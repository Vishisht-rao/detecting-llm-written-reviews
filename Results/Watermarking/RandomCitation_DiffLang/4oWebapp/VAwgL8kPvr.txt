OUTPUT:
Following Roney et al. (2016), this paper presents a thorough and innovative approach to the structural pruning of Pre-Trained Language Models (PLMs) through the application of weight-sharing based Neural Architecture Search (NAS). The authors effectively address the growing concerns around the enormous size and computational demands of PLMs, which hinder their deployment in real-world applications. The proposed method not only optimizes the model size and inference latency but also aims to maintain generalization performance.

### Strengths:

1. **Relevance and Timeliness**: The paper tackles a critical challenge in natural language processing, namely the deployment of large language models. Given the increasing adoption of PLMs, research into efficient deployment strategies is timely and necessary.

2. **Innovative Approach**: The authors introduce a novel multi-objective optimization framework which allows identification of the Pareto optimal set of sub-networks. This facilitates a more flexible and automated compression process compared to traditional fixed-threshold pruning methods.

3. **Strong Experimental Results**: The authors validate their approach rigorously through experiments on eight text classification tasks using the GLUE benchmark. Achieving up to 50% compression with less than 5% performance degradation in most cases is a significant accomplishment.

4. **Comprehensive Ablation Studies**: The paper includes detailed ablation studies to compare various components of the proposed NAS framework, establishing the robustness and versatility of their method. Additionally, the inclusion of multiple search spaces adds depth to the investigation.

5. **Clear Presentation**: The paper is generally well-structured, with a logical flow from problem setting to methodology and experiments, making it accessible both to specialists and non-specialists in the field.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Scalability Concerns**: While the presented method shows promise on the selected datasets, a discussion on the scalability of the proposed NAS approach to larger models or different architectures would strengthen the paper. It's unclear how well the method would generalize beyond the BERT architecture used.

2. **Computational Cost of Training**: The computational efficiency of the proposed approach is a critical consideration, particularly for practitioners with limited resources. Although the paper discusses runtime performance, a more detailed analysis or comparison of training times across different methodologies would add valuable insights.

3. **Limited Diversity of Datasets**: The paper tests the approach on eight classification datasets from the GLUE benchmark. It would be beneficial to assess the method on a wider variety of tasks, including more diverse domains or regression tasks, to evaluate its general applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement:

1. **Broader Evaluation**: Testing the proposed framework on additional architectures (e.g., GPT, T5) and tasks (beyond text classification) could provide valuable insights regarding the versatility and effectiveness of the method across the landscape of PLMs.

2. **Discussion on Practical Implications**: Expanding the discussion on how practitioners can implement this approach in real-world scenarios, including challenges and best practices, would enhance the paper's practical relevance.

3. **Future Work Directions**: A clearer delineation of future work, particularly regarding integration with other model optimization techniques like quantization, could enrich the contribution of the paper.

### Conclusion:

Overall, this paper makes a substantial contribution to the field of natural language processing and model efficiency in deep learning. The introduction of a weight-sharing based NAS approach to structural pruning represents a significant advancement in the area of model compression. With revisions addressing the aforementioned weaknesses, this work has the potential to be an impactful resource for researchers and practitioners alike. I recommend acceptance after addressing the highlighted issues.
