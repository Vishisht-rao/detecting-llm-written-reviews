OUTPUT:
This manuscript addresses a critical aspect of defending against unlearnable datasets (UDs), specifically focusing on the emerging threat of multiplication-based UDs, which current defense mechanisms struggle to handle. The paper introduces COIN, a novel defense strategy based on random multiplicative image transformation via interpolation, and demonstrates its effectiveness in mitigating the impact of these UDs. Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field, offering a promising solution to a significant vulnerability.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The paper addresses a crucial gap in the literature by focusing on defenses against multiplication-based UDs, a relatively unexplored yet impactful attack strategy. The problem is well-motivated, given the increasing reliance on large datasets and the potential for adversaries to inject unlearnable perturbations.
*   **Theoretical Justification:** The paper attempts to explain the mechanism behind multiplication-based UDs by introducing two new metrics, Θimi and Θimc, representing intra-class matrix inconsistency and inter-class matrix consistency, respectively. The hypothesis that increasing both metrics can mitigate the unlearnability effect is clearly stated and supported by initial experiments.
*   **Technical Contribution (COIN):** The proposed COIN defense mechanism is innovative and builds upon the theoretical understanding of multiplication-based UDs. The idea of using random pixel-based transformations to disrupt the multiplicative noise is well-articulated, and the bilinear interpolation approach seems promising.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The paper presents comprehensive experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet100) and various network architectures, demonstrating the superiority of COIN compared to existing defense strategies. The ablation studies on the parameter α provide valuable insights into the performance of COIN. The inclusion of defense against newly proposed UDs in GMM provides additional evidence about the generalizability of the defense.
*   **Clarity and Organization:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The problem statement, proposed solution, and experimental results are presented in a logical and coherent manner. The diagrams, particularly Figure 5, are helpful in understanding the COIN defense mechanism.
*   **Reproducibility:** The paper provides sufficient details about the experimental setup, including network architectures, datasets, training parameters, and code availability (linking to existing UDs code). The algorithms are clearly presented. This should aid in the reproducibility of the results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Theoretical Depth:** While the paper introduces Θimi and Θimc, the theoretical justification for their effectiveness could be strengthened. A more formal analysis of why these metrics are crucial for disrupting multiplication-based UDs would be beneficial. While the metrics are validated experimentally, a deeper connection to theoretical understandings of generalization and memorization could be included.
*   **Clarity of Algorithm 1:** While algorithm 1 is presented, its description (particularly the purpose of variables m and n) remains relatively opaque and could be significantly clarified to improve reader understanding. The motivation and impact of the modulo operation could also be explained better.
*   **Practicality of COIN:** The paper does not explicitly address the computational cost of the COIN defense mechanism. While the time complexity analysis suggests that COIN is relatively efficient, it would be helpful to provide more concrete measurements of the time overhead, especially in comparison to other defense strategies. What is the impact on training time? What are the memory requirements?
*   **Generality of the Approach:** While COIN is effective against the considered multiplication-based UDs, the paper could discuss the limitations of the approach and its potential vulnerability to other types of attacks or more sophisticated adversaries. How would the defense hold up if the adversary adapts to the new approach?
*   **Comparison to Other Corruption Defenses:** The paper compares COIN to standard defense techniques but could benefit from a more explicit comparison to other image corruption-based defenses, highlighting the specific advantages of COIN in the context of multiplication-based UDs. Also, the findings from additional image corruption investigations in Appendix A.2 could be integrated into the main part to provide more insights.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Strengthen the Theoretical Justification:** Provide a more in-depth theoretical analysis of Θimi and Θimc, explaining their connection to the effectiveness of multiplication-based UDs and the working principle of COIN.
*   **Improve the clarity of Algorithm 1 by adding comments, and describing variables and operations in more details.**
*   **Provide More Detailed Time Complexity Analysis:** Present concrete measurements of the time overhead of COIN, including training time and memory requirements, and compare it to other defense strategies.
*   **Discuss the Limitations of COIN:** Acknowledge the potential limitations of COIN and discuss its vulnerability to other types of attacks or more sophisticated adversaries. Suggest potential directions for future research to address these limitations.
*   **Include more detailed discussion of the experiment related to Figure 8.**
*   **Typos:** There appear to be some typos and formatting issues. E.g. in section 5.3, the light and deep green texts are hard to distinguish.

**Overall Recommendation:**

This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of adversarial machine learning by addressing the challenging problem of defending against multiplication-based UDs. The proposed COIN defense mechanism is innovative, theoretically motivated, and experimentally validated. While there are some weaknesses in the theoretical depth and practicality analysis, the paper is well-written, organized, and reproducible. I recommend **accepting** this paper for publication, subject to addressing the suggested improvements. The contributions are significant enough to merit acceptance even if all suggested improvements are not fully addressed.
