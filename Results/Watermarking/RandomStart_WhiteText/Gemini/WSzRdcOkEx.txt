OUTPUT:
The study examines the key context of adversarial robustness evaluation, highlighting the limitations of current methods that rely on aggregating local robustness results, potentially leading to biased assessments of global robustness. The paper introduces GREAT Score, a novel framework for global robustness evaluation of adversarial perturbations using generative models. This approach aims to address the identified challenges by leveraging generative models to approximate the underlying data distribution and provide a global statistic capturing the mean certified attack-proof perturbation level. The paper provides theoretical guarantees, demonstrates the efficiency and scalability of GREAT Score, and presents experimental results on standard datasets and online facial recognition services.

Here's a breakdown of the review:

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The paper presents a novel approach to adversarial robustness evaluation by shifting the focus from local to global robustness, leveraging generative models to approximate the true data distribution. This is a significant contribution to the field.
*   **Theoretical Foundation:** The paper provides a strong theoretical foundation for GREAT Score, including a formal definition of true global robustness, a certified global robustness estimate, and a probabilistic guarantee on the sample mean.  The theorems are well-defined and contribute to the rigor of the work.
*   **Practical Advantages:** GREAT Score offers several practical advantages, including computational efficiency, scalability to large models, and applicability to black-box settings. The ability to perform remote auditing of privacy-sensitive models is a valuable feature.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The paper presents comprehensive experimental results on standard datasets (CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1K) and online facial recognition APIs. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of GREAT Score in model ranking, local robustness analysis, and remote auditing. The comparison with RobustBench and AutoAttack provides a strong benchmark for evaluation.  The ablation studies are also well-designed and informative.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and clearly presents the problem, the proposed solution, and the experimental results. The organization is logical, and the figures and tables are helpful.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Generative Model Dependency:** The performance of GREAT Score is heavily dependent on the quality of the generative model used. While the paper includes an ablation study with different GANs, it would be beneficial to further explore the impact of generative model selection and potential biases introduced by the generative model itself. A discussion of failure cases or limitations arising from imperfections in the generative model would enhance the analysis.
*   **L2-Norm Limitation:** The framework is currently limited to L2-norm based perturbations. The paper acknowledges this limitation and suggests extending Stein's Lemma to other Lp-norms as a future direction. However, the practical implications of this limitation should be discussed in more detail.
*   **Calibration Dependence:**  While the calibration process improves the correlation with attack-based metrics, it introduces a dependence on hyperparameter tuning. The sensitivity of the results to the choice of temperature parameters should be further investigated.
*   **Clarity regarding synthetic data labels:** In section 4.5, a FAN classifier is used to label synthetic gender data. The possibility of errors in labels is not discussed. How do errors in labels impact the GREAT score?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand Discussion on Generative Model Impact:** Elaborate on the limitations and potential biases introduced by using generative models. Discuss strategies for selecting appropriate generative models and mitigating potential biases.  Consider an analysis of how different generative model architectures might influence the GREAT Score.
*   **Address L2-Norm Limitation:** While extending Stein's Lemma is a future direction, discuss the practical implications of the current L2-norm limitation. Are there specific scenarios where this limitation is particularly problematic? Are there alternative approaches for handling other perturbation types?
*   **Provide more detail on hyperparameter tuning:** Provide a more thorough justification of the hyperparameter values used in the CW attack and calibration process.
*   **Address potential errors in the ground truth labels of synthetic data:** Provide some analysis or discussion of the impact of label noise of the GREAT score

**Overall:**

This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of adversarial robustness evaluation. The GREAT Score framework offers a novel, efficient, and scalable approach to assessing global robustness, with theoretical guarantees and practical advantages. While there are some limitations and areas for improvement, the paper is well-written, thoroughly evaluated, and makes a valuable contribution to the research community. I recommend acceptance, pending consideration of the suggestions for improvement.
