OUTPUT:
The study focuses on the area of neural theorem proving, specifically addressing the challenge of automating formal reasoning tasks. The paper introduces LEGO-Prover, a novel approach that utilizes a growing skill library of verified lemmas to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in proving theorems. This approach contrasts with existing methods that rely on a fixed theorem library, arguing that the ability to create and leverage new theorems is crucial for advancing mathematical understanding and tackling complex problems.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The core idea of LEGO-Prover, which uses a growing and evolving skill library to assist LLMs in theorem proving, is innovative and addresses a key limitation of existing approaches.
*   **Modularity:** The modular approach of constructing proofs block-by-block, using retrieved and newly generated lemmas, is well-motivated and aligns with human problem-solving strategies.
*   **Clear Architecture:** The paper clearly explains the framework, including the prover, evolver, and skill library components, and their interactions. The algorithms are well-defined, with pseudo-code providing valuable details.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The experiments on the miniF2F dataset demonstrate a significant improvement in pass rates compared to state-of-the-art methods. The ablation studies effectively highlight the importance of the growing skill library.
*   **Detailed Analysis:** The analysis of the skill library's composition and usage provides valuable insights into how the learned skills contribute to the LLM's problem-solving abilities. The case studies, including the skill-evolving tree, showcase the practical implications of the approach.
*   **Well-written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written, with a logical flow and clear explanations. The figures and tables are helpful in understanding the framework and results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Computational Cost:** The computational cost associated with maintaining and updating the skill library, as highlighted in Appendix A.3, appears to be a significant drawback. While the paper provides some mitigation strategies, further optimization in this area is needed. The token consumption analysis shows that a significant portion of computation is spent without results and needs to be more efficient.
*   **Generality of Skills:** While the evolver aims to improve the generality of skills, the paper acknowledges that many generated lemmas remain problem-specific. The limited applicability can limit the long-term scalability of the approach. The analysis shows relatively limited use of evolved theorems compared to directly solving requests.
*   **Dataset Limitation:** The use of miniF2F dataset, while standard, might limit the generalizability of the findings. The dataset is relatively small and might not fully represent the complexities of real-world mathematical problems. The paper notes that the characteristics of miniF2F, including many trivial problems, limit gains.
*   **LLM Selection Bias:** Using solely the ChatGPT family of models may limit the scope of the results. Testing with other LLMs, particularly those specialized in code generation or mathematics, would strengthen the findings.
*   **Lack of Comparative Efficiency Analysis:** A deeper comparison of the *efficiency* of LEGO-Prover (e.g., time to prove a theorem) compared to baselines would be beneficial. While the pass rate is improved, it's not clear if this comes at a significant cost in processing time.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Cost Reduction Strategies:** Investigate and implement more efficient methods for generating and evolving skills. Explore techniques like reinforcement learning or active learning to prioritize the generation of useful and generalizable lemmas.
*   **Skill Generalization:** Develop more sophisticated techniques for transforming problem-specific lemmas into more general and reusable skills. Explore methods for identifying key concepts and generalizing across different mathematical domains.
*   **Dataset Expansion:** Evaluate LEGO-Prover on larger and more diverse datasets, such as the full MATH dataset or other formal mathematics benchmarks. This would help to assess the generalizability of the approach.
*   **LLM Exploration:** Experiment with different LLMs, especially those with strong code generation or mathematical reasoning capabilities. This could potentially improve the performance of both the prover and the evolver.
*   **Efficiency Analysis:** Include a comparative analysis of the time complexity and resource utilization of LEGO-Prover compared to existing methods. Quantify the trade-offs between pass rate and computational cost.
*   **Error Analysis:** A deeper error analysis of the types of problems that LEGO-Prover fails to solve could provide valuable insights for future research. Identifying common failure modes can help to guide the development of more robust and effective techniques.
*   **Scalability Discussion:** Provide a more detailed discussion of the potential scalability of LEGO-Prover to larger and more complex mathematical problems. Discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with scaling the skill library and managing the computational cost.

**Overall Score:**

I would rate this paper as a **7/10**. It presents a novel and well-executed approach to neural theorem proving with promising results. The main area for improvement lies in addressing the computational cost and enhancing the generality of learned skills, while other LLMs need to be explored. The work makes a significant contribution to the field and has the potential to inspire further research in automated reasoning and AI-assisted mathematics.
