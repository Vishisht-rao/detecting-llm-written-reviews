OUTPUT:
This article investigates the topic of using forward-backward models to approximate Markov Decision Process (MDP) homomorphisms for improved sample efficiency in reinforcement learning (RL). The authors propose a novel approach called "equivalent effect abstraction," which leverages a learned partial model of environment dynamics to infer state-action pairs that lead to the same next state. By mapping these pairs to a single abstract state-action, the method aims to reduce the effective size of the state-action space and accelerate policy learning.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The core idea of using forward and backward dynamics models to infer state-action equivalences is a fresh perspective on the problem of learning MDP homomorphisms. This approach differs from previous methods that often rely on prior knowledge of environment symmetries or complex contrastive learning schemes.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and explains the concept of equivalent effect abstraction in a clear and accessible manner. The inclusion of examples, such as the Asterix game, helps to illustrate the intuition behind the method.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The experimental results are compelling, demonstrating improved sample efficiency compared to vanilla DQN and other existing methods on several benchmark environments, including tabular mazes, Cartpole, Predator-Prey, and the challenging MinAtar suite. The authors also provide results that break down their improvement on the MinAtar Suite.
*   **Thorough Evaluation:** The authors compare their method against several baselines, including vanilla DQN, MDP Homomorphic Networks, and PRAE, using the implementations provided by the original authors to ensure the comparison is fair. Additionally, in MinAtar, a Dyna-DQN baseline is provided for an even more direct comparison.
*   **Addressing Limitations:** The paper acknowledges the limitations of the approach, such as the deterministic dynamics assumptions and the potential for unpredictable backwards transitions, and suggests potential avenues for future research to address these issues.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Deterministic Dynamics Assumption:** The method's reliance on deterministic or near-deterministic dynamics is a significant limitation. While the paper acknowledges this and suggests potential solutions involving stochastic models, the current formulation may not be applicable to a wide range of real-world RL problems with highly stochastic environments. The theoretical justification does seem to hinge on deterministic dynamics, but the MinAtar experiments show that the method is applicable to some stochastic environments.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The paper mentions that the choice of the hypothetical action can be critical, but the selection process is not fully automated. A more robust and automated method for determining the hypothetical action would be beneficial. The authors mention that it can be chosen randomly in Cartpole, but that this is not true in more complex environments.
*   **Limited Theoretical Analysis:** While the paper provides an intuitive explanation of why equivalent effect abstraction works, a more rigorous theoretical analysis of its convergence properties and potential benefits would strengthen the contribution.
*   **Impact Statement:** The impact statement is brief and somewhat generic. A more detailed discussion of the potential societal implications of the research, both positive and negative, would be valuable.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Investigate Stochastic Extensions:** Explore and evaluate the suggested extensions to handle stochastic dynamics, such as using stochastic forwards and backwards models or uncertainty predictions to revert to vanilla Q-learning.
*   **Automate Hypothetical Action Selection:** Develop a more automated method for selecting the hypothetical action, potentially based on analyzing the environment dynamics or learning a policy to choose the best action for abstraction.
*   **Provide a More Detailed Theoretical Analysis:** Investigate the convergence properties of equivalent effect abstraction and provide a more rigorous theoretical justification for its benefits, particularly in terms of sample complexity.
*   **Expand Impact Statement:** Provide a more detailed and nuanced discussion of the potential societal impacts of the research.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a promising and novel approach to learning MDP homomorphisms for improved sample efficiency in reinforcement learning. The experimental results are compelling, and the paper is generally well-written and clear. While the deterministic dynamics assumption and other limitations need to be addressed, the proposed method has the potential to significantly advance the field of sample-efficient RL. I recommend acceptance, pending revisions that address the weaknesses and suggestions for improvement outlined above.
