OUTPUT:
The study explores the key context of cross-domain molecule learning, specifically addressing the gap in existing pre-trained models that primarily focus on either small molecules or proteins, neglecting their binding interactions crucial for biological processes. The paper introduces BIT (Biomolecular Interaction Transformer), a general-purpose foundation model designed to encode small molecules, proteins, and protein-ligand complexes in both 2D and 3D formats using a shared Transformer backbone and unified self-supervised denoising tasks. The authors propose Mixture-of-Domain-Experts (MoDE) to handle diverse chemical domains and incorporate structural channels to capture positional dependencies.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses an Important Gap:** The paper tackles a significant limitation in current biomolecular pre-training approaches by explicitly considering cross-domain interactions between proteins and ligands.
*   **Novel Architecture (BIT/MoDE):** The proposed BIT architecture with MoDE is a well-motivated approach to integrate information from different domains and capture domain-specific knowledge. The choice of a Transformer backbone is also justified by its versatility in handling various data modalities.
*   **Comprehensive Pre-training:** The pre-training strategy on both protein-ligand complexes (Q-BioLiP) and small molecules (PCQM4Mv2) with denoising tasks is thorough and appropriate for the model's objective.
*   **Strong Experimental Results:** The paper presents compelling experimental results on various downstream tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of BIT in binding affinity prediction, virtual screening, and molecular property prediction. BIT consistently outperforms specialized baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance in several tasks.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, with a clear introduction, detailed methods section, and comprehensive experimental evaluation. The figures are also helpful in understanding the model architecture and workflow.
*   **Ablation studies:** The paper includes ablation studies that assess the contribution of key components, which strengthens the findings.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity on Binding Pocket Selection:** While the paper mentions using a distance cutoff of 5Ã… to define the binding pocket, more detail on the robustness of this method and any potential variations in pocket definition would be beneficial. A short ablation study that uses different cutoff values for the binding pocket definition can show how the model performance varies.
*   **Computational Cost:** The paper mentions training on 64 V100 GPUs for approximately 2 days. Providing more details on the model size, training time per epoch, and inference time for different tasks would give a better sense of the computational resources required to use BIT.
*   **Limited Comparison with Similar Approaches:** There is some similarity with previous multimodal approaches. While the paper does discuss CoSP and other related works, a more thorough comparison with models that similarly leverage both protein and ligand information, especially in the related works section, would provide more context for BIT's contribution.
*   **Minor clarity issue on figure 1:** It's difficult to discern from the figure what are the domain-specific parts. For example, it is not immediately clear that M-FFN is Molecule FFN and P-FFN is Protein FFN. The figure legend could have some text that provides the reader with this information.
*   **Hyperparameter search space:** The molecule property prediction section mentions grid search to find the hyperparameters. It might be useful to report the range of hyperparameter values used for the grid search (e.g. learning rate, batch size) in the methods section.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Elaborate on Binding Pocket Definition:** Provide more details on the method used to identify binding pockets and address potential limitations of this approach.
*   **Provide More Computational Details:** Include more information on model size, training time, and inference time to give a better understanding of the computational cost of using BIT.
*   **Strengthen Comparison with Related Works:** Provide a more comprehensive comparison with other models that utilize both protein and ligand information, highlighting the unique aspects of BIT.
*   **Add explanation for figure 1:** Add text within the caption or in the main text to clarify the acronyms for the domain specific parts.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a strong contribution to the field of cross-domain molecule learning. The proposed BIT architecture with MoDE is a novel and effective approach to capture interactions between proteins and ligands. The comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of BIT on various downstream tasks. Despite some minor weaknesses, the paper is well-written and organized, and the results are compelling. I recommend this paper for acceptance.
