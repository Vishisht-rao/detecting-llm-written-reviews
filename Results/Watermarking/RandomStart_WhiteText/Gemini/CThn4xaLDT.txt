OUTPUT:
This paper examines an important area: the development of efficient and effective equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs) for modeling geometric data. The authors introduce a novel concept called "Scalar Interaction Network" (SINet) built upon the principle of "Replacing Equivariant Basis with Input Feature" (REBIF). The paper argues that existing equivariant operations, like tensor product and scalarization, can be unified under the framework of equivariant basis decomposition, and that REBIF offers a computationally cheaper alternative by utilizing input features as the equivariant basis. The proposed SINet is claimed to achieve competitive performance on quantum system modeling tasks while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to tensor-product-based methods.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Conceptual Framework:** The paper presents a fresh perspective on equivariant operations by framing them as equivariant basis decomposition. The REBIF principle is a novel idea that can potentially lead to more efficient EGNN architectures. The unification of existing methods under this framework contributes to a better understanding of the design space.
*   **Computational Efficiency:** A key strength of the paper is the claim of reduced computational complexity. The authors highlight the O(L^2) complexity of SINet compared to the O(L^6) complexity of tensor product methods, which is a significant improvement, especially for high-order representations. The experiments (Fig 3a and 3b) seem to support this claim.
*   **Empirical Evaluation:** The paper provides empirical results on the QM9 and N-body system datasets, demonstrating SINet's competitive performance and efficiency. The ablation studies (Table 3) provide further insights into the impact of different design choices. The results show that SINet outperforms EGNN and TFN, indicating a practical improvement.
*   **Clarity of Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, with a clear introduction, explanation of the proposed method, and discussion of related works. The definitions of equivariant basis and REBIF are clearly stated. The figures, such as Figure 1 and Figure 2, aid in understanding the concepts.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Generality of REBIF:** The assumption that input features can always span the required output space is a potential limitation. While the authors provide numerical analysis to support this claim (subsection 5.2), it is not clear how this holds in more complex scenarios or with limited channel sizes. More theoretical justification or broader empirical validation is needed.
*   **Expressiveness Limitations:** While the authors acknowledge the potential expressiveness limitations of REBIF, the discussion is somewhat brief.  The paper states that information loss might occur for type-l vectors when using inner products to construct scalars. A more in-depth analysis of these limitations and potential mitigation strategies would strengthen the paper. It is not clear what happens when you don't introduce higher order l-type features.
*   **Comparison to State-of-the-Art:** While SINet shows competitive performance, it does not consistently outperform the state-of-the-art methods on QM9.  SiFormer shows improvement over SINet, and seems comparable to state of the art, but this leads to the question of how much of the contribution comes from the scalar interaction itself.
*   **Lack of Detailed Ablation Studies:** While some ablation studies are presented, more detailed analyses could be beneficial. For example, it would be helpful to understand the individual contribution of the scalar interaction components, the impact of different channel sizes, and the sensitivity of SINet to hyperparameter choices.
*   **Limited Scope of Experiments:** The experiments are limited to two datasets (QM9 and N-body systems).  Evaluating SINet on a wider range of geometric modeling tasks would provide a more comprehensive assessment of its generalizability and robustness.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Strengthen Justification for REBIF:** Provide more theoretical or empirical justification for the assumption that input features can span the required output space. Explore the limitations of this assumption and potential mitigation strategies.
*   **Address Expressiveness Limitations:** Provide a more in-depth analysis of the expressiveness limitations of Scalar Interaction, especially regarding the potential loss of information for higher-order type-l vectors. Discuss alternative methods for constructing scalars or modifications to the architecture to address these limitations.
*   **Conduct More Detailed Ablation Studies:** Perform more detailed ablation studies to isolate the individual contributions of different components of SINet and to understand its sensitivity to hyperparameter choices.
*   **Expand Experimental Evaluation:** Evaluate SINet on a wider range of geometric modeling tasks to assess its generalizability and robustness.
*   **Clarify the Role of Tensor Product Layer:** Explain why only *one* tensor product layer is used. Is there a theoretical justification, or is this purely an empirical observation?

**Overall:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of equivariant graph neural networks. The proposed Scalar Interaction Network and REBIF principle offer a promising approach for developing more efficient EGNN architectures. While there are some limitations and areas for improvement, the paper is well-written, conceptually sound, and empirically validated. I am leaning towards accepting this paper, pending improvements addressing the weaknesses highlighted above.
