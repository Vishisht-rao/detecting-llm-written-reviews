OUTPUT:
The research examines an important topic: deep clustering in the presence of imbalanced datasets. The paper proposes a novel pseudo-labeling-based learning framework, P2OT (Progressive Partial Optimal Transport), designed to address the challenges of deep imbalanced clustering. The core idea is to formulate pseudo-label generation as a progressive partial optimal transport problem, enabling the model to learn from high-confidence samples while accounting for class imbalance. The authors reformulate the problem as an unbalanced optimal transport problem and solve it efficiently using a fast matrix scaling algorithm. Experimental results on several datasets, including a human-curated long-tailed CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and subsets of iNaturalist2018, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses a Practical Problem:** The paper tackles a significant limitation of existing deep clustering methods, which often assume balanced datasets. The introduction of the "deep imbalanced clustering" problem setting is highly relevant and timely.
*   **Novel Approach:** The P2OT framework offers a novel and theoretically grounded approach to generating pseudo-labels in imbalanced settings. The integration of imbalance class distribution modeling and confident sample selection within a single optimization problem is a key strength.
*   **Efficient Solver:** The reformulation of P2OT as an unbalanced OT problem and the use of a fast matrix scaling algorithm contribute to the computational efficiency of the method. The comparison against the generalized scaling algorithm further strengthens this point.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The experimental evaluation is thorough, covering a range of datasets with varying degrees of imbalance and fine-grained categories. The inclusion of ImageNet-R as an "out-of-distribution" dataset is a valuable aspect of the evaluation. The detailed analysis of results for Head, Medium, and Tail classes provides a more nuanced understanding of the method's performance.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it relatively easy to follow the problem formulation, proposed method, and experimental results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** While the paper claims that the proposed method alleviates sensitive hyperparameter tuning, the ablation study reveals that the choice of initial ρ0 and the ramp-up strategy can still impact performance. A more detailed discussion of how to choose these hyperparameters would be beneficial. Also, the conclusion "a good starting value for ρ0 is around 0.1, and it should be progressively increased during training" is not as convincing as it could be given that multiple values for the hyperparameters were tested.
*   **Clarity on Implementation Details:** While implementation details are given in Appendix F, it would be helpful to have a high-level overview in the main body to clarify how mini-batching and the memory buffer are integrated into the P2OT algorithm.
*   **Justification for ViT-B16:** While using ViT-B16 is justified by its success in previous works and ease of transfer learning, the selection of the *last* block for finetuning could benefit from more explanation or experimental justification. Would another block or combination of blocks have performed better?
*   **Adaptive Ramp-Up Strategy:** The paper acknowledges that a fixed parameterization of ρ may not be optimal and suggests an adaptive approach based on the model's learning progress. Exploring this idea further or outlining potential strategies for future work would strengthen the conclusion.
*   **Limited Comparison to Recent Methods for imbalanced datasets:** While the work touches on the challenges of SPICE with imbalanced data, a deeper comparison with other recent methods designed to combat class imbalance, specifically within the *clustering* domain, would provide a more comprehensive landscape of existing solutions.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand Hyperparameter Discussion:** Provide more guidance on selecting ρ0 and the ramp-up strategy, potentially including a small grid search or rule-of-thumb approach.
*   **Clarify Mini-Batch Integration:** Add a brief overview of how mini-batching and the memory buffer are used in the P2OT algorithm within the main paper's methods section.
*   **Ablate Blocks Finetuned:** Justify or experiment with blocks other than the *last* block for finetuning.
*   **Discuss Adaptive Ramp-Up:** Elaborate on potential strategies for adaptive adjustment of ρ based on the model's learning progress. Even a brief discussion would increase the impact of the conclusion.
*   **Compare to More Imbalance-Specific Methods:** Strengthen the literature review and experimental comparison by including a discussion of, and comparison to, other recent clustering approaches specifically designed for imbalanced datasets.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that addresses an important and timely problem in deep clustering. The proposed P2OT framework is novel, theoretically sound, and experimentally validated. The paper has a few minor weaknesses, but the strengths outweigh them, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
