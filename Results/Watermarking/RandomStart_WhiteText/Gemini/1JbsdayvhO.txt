OUTPUT:
This manuscript examines the aspect of generating 3D scenes from 2D images using a novel denoising diffusion model called Generative Image-Based Rendering (GIBR). The paper tackles the challenges of creating consistent and detailed 3D representations from sparse 2D views, a problem that existing methods struggle with due to limitations in scene representation, data scarcity, and the difficulty of sampling from the true posterior distribution. GIBR introduces a new neural scene representation, IB-planes, a multi-view denoising diffusion framework, and a dropout strategy to prevent trivial solutions. The authors demonstrate through experiments on challenging real and synthetic datasets that GIBR outperforms existing methods in generation, novel view synthesis, and 3D reconstruction.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The paper presents a novel approach to a challenging problem, addressing the limitations of existing methods with a combination of innovative techniques. The idea of using IB-planes and a denoising diffusion framework specifically designed for multi-view images is a significant contribution. The principled dropout approach is also a clever way to avoid trivial solutions.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed method, including the underlying theory and implementation details. The architecture and training procedure are well-described. The ablation studies provide insights into the importance of each component of the proposed method.
*   **Experimental Evaluation:** The paper presents a comprehensive experimental evaluation on several challenging datasets, including real-world and synthetic data. The use of multiple evaluation metrics and comparisons to strong baselines demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The qualitative results further illustrate the advantages of GIBR in generating realistic and detailed 3D scenes. The extensive supplementary material with videos is also a plus.
*   **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The introduction clearly outlines the problem and contributions, and the method section provides a detailed explanation of the proposed approach. The related work section appropriately positions the paper within the existing literature. The figures and tables are well-designed and contribute to the overall clarity of the paper.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Computational Cost:** The paper mentions that training the model is computationally expensive due to the volumetric ray-marching process. However, it would be beneficial to provide more specific details on the training time and resource requirements. This would allow readers to better assess the feasibility of using GIBR for different applications. Including information about inference time would be helpful as well.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The paper does not discuss the sensitivity of the model to different hyperparameters. It would be helpful to provide some guidance on how to choose appropriate hyperparameter values for different datasets and tasks.
*   **Dataset Normalization details:** The paper notes some normalization that goes into various datasets used in the study. It is not fully clear what the baselines were exposed to for the specific normalization that was done for different data. Was it truly equal or were there normalization choices that gave one method a leg up on another?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   Add more details on the computational cost of training and inference, including training time, resource requirements, and inference speed.
*   Discuss the sensitivity of the model to different hyperparameters and provide guidance on how to choose appropriate values.
*   Include a section on limitations and future work, discussing the remaining challenges and potential directions for further research.
*   Add a discussion of negative results for ideas that were tried that failed to produce gains.
*   Clarify the dataset normalization process for both the proposed method and the baselines, ensuring a fair comparison and addressing any potential biases.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach to generating 3D scenes from 2D images. The proposed method addresses the limitations of existing techniques and achieves superior performance on challenging datasets. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, and the experimental evaluation is comprehensive and convincing. Addressing the minor weaknesses and suggestions for improvement would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact.
