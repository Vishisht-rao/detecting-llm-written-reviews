OUTPUT:
This article examines the key problem of effectively solving Job-shop Scheduling Problems (JSSP) using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The paper identifies a limitation in existing DRL approaches that rely on construction heuristics, which struggle to model partial solutions due to unsuitable graph representations. To address this, the authors propose a novel DRL-guided improvement heuristic that operates on complete solutions represented as disjunctive graphs.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Identification and Motivation:** The paper clearly articulates the shortcomings of current DRL-based construction heuristics for JSSP and convincingly motivates the need for an improvement-based approach.
*   **Novelty of Approach:** The shift from construction to improvement heuristics guided by DRL is a valuable contribution to the field, especially considering the limited exploration of this paradigm in scheduling compared to routing problems.
*   **GNN-based Representation:** The proposed Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture is well-designed, incorporating two modules (Topological Embedding Module and Context-Aware Embedding Module) to capture both the dynamic topology and the heterogeneity of nodes in the disjunctive graph. The modular design allows for the capture of structural differences and machine-job relationship that are critical in improving scheduling solutions.
*   **Efficient Solution Evaluation:** The message-passing mechanism for parallel solution evaluation is a significant contribution, addressing the computational bottleneck associated with evaluating multiple solutions during the improvement process. The proof of linear complexity is a valuable addition.
*   **Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation:** The experiments are thorough and cover a range of classic benchmarks, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art DRL baselines and hand-crafted heuristics. The comparison with Google OR-Tools CP-SAT further strengthens the findings.
*   **Theoretical Analysis:** The paper provides theoretical analysis of the computational complexity of the policy network and the message-passing mechanism, adding rigor to the work.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors state that code and data will be publicly available, enhancing the reproducibility and accessibility of their research.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity in State Transition Details:** The section describing state transitions (e.g., after swapping operations) could benefit from more detailed examples and illustrations to fully clarify the process, although this is addressed in the supplementary materials. Describing the exact implementation details of the N5 neighborhood structure and the swap mechanism with the disjunctive graph would improve clarity.
*   **Limited Ablation on Key Hyperparameters:** While the ablation studies show the benefit of using the TPM and CAM modules, a more in-depth exploration of other key hyperparameters (e.g., the number of GNN layers, embedding dimensions, and training parameters) could further optimize the method.
*   **Comparison with Tabu Search:** While a comparison with Tabu Search is included in the appendix, incorporating these results in the main body with a table comparing with the average gaps to best known solutions would enhance the impact.
*   **Initial Solution Dependency:** The method depends on an initial solution generated by a dispatching rule. The impact of the quality of the initial solution on the final performance should be discussed. How sensitive is the final solution to the quality of the initial solution, and does the learning-based approach consistently improve upon poor initial solutions?

**Overall:**

The paper presents a strong and well-executed contribution to the field of DRL for JSSP. The proposed DRL-guided improvement heuristic, combined with the novel GNN architecture and efficient solution evaluation mechanism, offers a promising approach for solving complex scheduling problems. The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, and the theoretical analysis provides a solid foundation for future research. The weaknesses identified are relatively minor and do not detract significantly from the overall value of the paper.

**Recommendations:**

*   Expand the explanation of state transitions within the main text with clearer, more detailed examples, possibly referring to the supplementary material.
*   Consider including more ablation studies or sensitivity analysis on key hyperparameters.
*   Move the Tabu Search comparison results into the main body if space permits, and include discussion of sensitivity to the initial solution.
*   Discuss the limitations of the current approach and potential future research directions more explicitly.
