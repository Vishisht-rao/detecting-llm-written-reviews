OUTPUT:
The manuscript focuses on the key aspect of self-supervised learning for remote sensing time series data, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data by introducing a lightweight transformer-based model called Presto. The paper argues that existing methods often treat remote sensing data as analogous to natural images, failing to leverage the unique characteristics of remote sensing data, such as the temporal dimension and multi-modal data from diverse sensors. Presto is designed to ingest pixel-timeseries data, pre-trained with a novel masked autoencoding approach, and evaluated on a variety of downstream tasks across different geographies and data modalities. The authors demonstrate that Presto achieves competitive performance compared to larger models while requiring significantly less computation, making it suitable for deployment at scale.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The paper presents a novel approach (Presto) that is specifically tailored for remote sensing time series data, moving beyond direct adaptation of methods designed for natural images. The structured masking strategy in the self-supervised pre-training is also a novel contribution.
*   **Relevance:** The problem addressed (limited labeled remote sensing data) is a significant challenge in the field, and the proposed solution is highly relevant for various applications, including sustainable development, weather forecasting, and disaster management.
*   **Thorough Evaluation:** The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of Presto across a diverse set of tasks, datasets, and geographies. The comparisons against state-of-the-art models and baselines (including task-specific baselines) are convincing. The ablation studies (e.g., masking strategies, missing data) provide valuable insights.
*   **Computational Efficiency:** The emphasis on computational efficiency is a key strength, as it addresses a critical consideration for deploying remote sensing models at scale. The authors demonstrate that Presto achieves competitive performance with significantly fewer parameters and FLOPs than larger models.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written, clearly organized, and easy to follow. The figures and tables are helpful in visualizing the method and presenting the results. The inclusion of the appendix with detailed implementation details, hyperparameter settings, and further analysis strengthens the reproducibility of the work.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors have made their code publicly available (anonymously), which further boosts confidence in the reproducibility of their experiments.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Novelty of Architecture:** While the application of Transformers to remote sensing time series is not entirely novel (as acknowledged by the authors), the novelty lies in the pre-training strategy and the lightweight design specifically for remote sensing characteristics. This could be emphasized even further.
*   **Discussion of Limitations could be More Prominent:** The discussion of Presto's failure modes, particularly in image-based tasks where spatial context is important, is somewhat buried in the Appendix. Bringing this discussion to the main body of the paper would provide a more balanced perspective. For example, the plateauing of EuroSat performance at higher resolutions should be a point of discussion in the main paper, because it highlights an architectural limitation of Presto.
*   **Limited comparison with other time-series models**: Apart from MOSAIKS-1D, which is an adapted image processing model, the paper doesn't compare performance with dedicated time series models such as LSTMs and other transformer-based time series architectures on the multi-label or regression tasks. This comparison would strengthen the claim for the efficiency of Presto on remote sensing data.
*   **Justification for hyperparameter choices**: The paper doesn't sufficiently justify the hyperparameter choices for the pre-training stage, especially the learning rate and masking ratio. An ablation study varying these parameters might provide insight into the robustness of Presto.
*   **Reproducibility considerations**: Although the paper states that all the training and evaluation code will be made available, it would be useful to explicitly specify the versions of the dependencies used for the evaluation. This information would ensure future reproducibility of the models.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Explicitly State Limitations:** Emphasize the limitations of Presto in the abstract and introduction, particularly its limitations regarding the processing of very high-resolution imagery and the handling of spatial context in image-based tasks.
*   **Elaborate on Architecture Choices:** Provide more rationale behind the specific architecture choices made for Presto. Why these specific encoder and decoder depths and widths? Why these masking strategies?
*   **Compare with Time-Series Methods:** Include a comparison against standard time-series models (e.g., LSTMs, other time-series transformer variants) on at least one of the time-series tasks to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
*   **Add Ablation Studies on Hyperparameters:** Add ablation studies on the learning rate and the masking ratio hyperparameters used in the pre-training stage.
*   **Add information on reproducibility**: Include a small section specifying the dependency versions used for model training and evaluation to increase model reproducibility in the future.

**Overall Score:**

I would rate this paper as a **7/10**. The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of self-supervised learning for remote sensing time series data. The proposed method is novel, relevant, and well-evaluated. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact.
