OUTPUT:
This manuscript investigates an important topic concerning the vulnerability of deep learning models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) to information retrieval attacks, particularly in scenarios where models interpolate the training data. The authors present a novel analysis that connects model stability and a newly introduced concept of "feature alignment" to quantify the resistance of ERM models against such attacks. They provide theoretical characterizations of feature alignment for random features (RF) and neural tangent kernel (NTK) regression, showing how the attack weakens with increased generalization capability. Experimental results on synthetic and standard datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10) support their theoretical findings and suggest broader applicability to deep neural networks.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The introduction of "feature alignment" as a key factor in understanding the success of information retrieval attacks is a significant contribution. To the best of my knowledge, as stated in the paper, this is the first time this concept is explicitly considered in this context.
*   **Theoretical Rigor:** The paper provides a precise characterization of feature alignment for RF and NTK models, including closed-form expressions that connect the attack power to model parameters and activation functions. The connection between stability, generalization, and feature alignment is clearly articulated.
*   **Practical Relevance:** The problem addressed is highly relevant, given the increasing concerns about privacy in machine learning and the widespread use of ERM in practice. The analysis sheds light on the inherent privacy risks of interpolating models, even without explicit privacy-preserving mechanisms.
*   **Strong Empirical Validation:** The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the agreement between the theoretical predictions and the observed performance of RF, NTK, and deep neural networks on various datasets. The proportionality between test error and attack accuracy provides strong empirical evidence for the generality of the findings.
*   **Well-structured and Clearly Written:** The paper is generally well-organized and the main ideas are clearly presented. The related work section provides a good overview of the existing literature.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Scope of Theoretical Analysis:** The theoretical analysis is primarily focused on RF and NTK models, which are simplifications of real-world deep neural networks. While the experiments suggest broader applicability, a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the theoretical framework and potential extensions to more complex models would be valuable.
*   **Assumption of Interpolation:** The analysis relies on the assumption that the models perfectly interpolate the training data. While this assumption simplifies the analysis, it may not always hold in practice, especially for large datasets or complex models. A discussion of how the results might change under weaker assumptions about interpolation would be beneficial.
*   **Clarity in Technical Sections:** While the overall structure is sound, the mathematical derivations in Sections 5 and 6 (and the appendices) can be quite dense and challenging to follow for readers without a strong background in kernel methods and high-dimensional probability. Improving the readability of these sections by providing more detailed explanations and intuitions would be helpful.
*   **Lack of Discussion on Mitigation Strategies:** While the paper identifies the vulnerabilities of ERM models to information retrieval attacks, it does not offer specific strategies for mitigating these risks. A brief discussion of potential approaches for improving the privacy of interpolating models, such as regularization techniques or modified training algorithms, would enhance the practical impact of the work.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand Discussion on Limitations:** Provide a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the theoretical analysis and potential extensions to more complex models, feature maps, and architectures.
*   **Address the Interpolation Assumption:** Discuss how the results might change under weaker assumptions about interpolation. Could you offer insights about how the relationships observed might vary as the model transitions between underfitting and overfitting?
*   **Improve Clarity of Technical Sections:** Provide more detailed explanations and intuitions for the mathematical derivations in Sections 5 and 6 (and appendices). Consider adding intermediate steps and simplifying the notation where possible.
*   **Discuss Mitigation Strategies:** Add a brief discussion of potential approaches for mitigating the privacy risks identified in the paper, such as regularization techniques or modified training algorithms.
*   **Further Experiments:** Consider adding experiments that vary the interpolation level of the models (e.g., by adding regularization or early stopping) to assess the robustness of the findings to deviations from the perfect interpolation assumption.
*   **Explicitly mention the computational cost of the attack.** How many queries does it require to achieve the demonstrated attack accuracy? What is the dependence on dimensionality of the model/data?

**Overall Assessment:**

The paper presents a valuable and timely analysis of the privacy risks associated with ERM-trained models that interpolate the training data. The introduction of feature alignment and the theoretical characterization of its relationship to model stability and generalization are significant contributions. While there are some limitations in the scope of the theoretical analysis and the clarity of the technical sections, the strong empirical validation and the practical relevance of the problem make this a worthwhile contribution. I recommend acceptance, with the suggestions above taken into account to improve clarity, scope, and practical utility.
