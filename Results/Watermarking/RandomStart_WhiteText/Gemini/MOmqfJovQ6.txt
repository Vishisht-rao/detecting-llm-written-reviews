OUTPUT:
This paper addresses a critical aspect of reinforcement learning: the curse of dimensionality arising from large action spaces. The authors propose a novel action space reduction technique based on grouping actions with similar transition distributions and reward functions. This approach aims to balance the trade-off between performance degradation due to approximation and the reduction in sample and computational complexity.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Relevance:** The paper tackles a significant challenge in RL, making it highly relevant to the community. The curse of dimensionality in action spaces is a practical hurdle, and efficient solutions are valuable.
*   **Novelty:** The idea of explicitly optimizing the action grouping strategy to balance approximation and estimation errors is interesting and novel. The linear decomposition model to capture intra-group differences is a good way to assess the impact of the grouping.
*   **Theoretical Analysis:** The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the performance loss, decomposing it into approximation and estimation errors. This provides valuable insights into the factors affecting performance. The comparison with existing lower bounds and demonstration of approximation error tightness adds to the theoretical rigor.
*   **Counter-Intuitive Finding:** The paper highlights the counter-intuitive result that a finer grouping strategy doesn't always lead to better performance, especially with limited resources. This challenges common assumptions and adds depth to the analysis.
*   **Practical Optimization:** The formulation of a general optimization problem and the proposed computationally efficient method for selecting a nearly-optimal grouping strategy make the approach practical and applicable.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The experimental results (e.g., the downlink transmission scenario) provide empirical support for the theoretical analysis, demonstrating the trade-offs between grouping strategies, sample size, and performance. The use of both grouping and non-grouping settings as well as different sample sizes help validate the counter-intuitive findings.
*   **Clarity of Writing (Generally):** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making the concepts relatively easy to follow. The introduction clearly lays out the problem and contributions, and the related work section is comprehensive.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Complexity of Theorem 1:** While the theoretical analysis is a strength, Theorem 1 is somewhat complex, involving several terms and parameters that might be difficult for readers to grasp quickly. A more intuitive explanation or breakdown of the theorem could be beneficial.
*   **Practicality of Linear Decomposition Model:** The paper mentions using expert knowledge or solving equations to obtain the linear decomposition (P1, P2) and (R1, R2). The practicality of this in complex, real-world environments could be a concern. More details on how to apply this practically would be valuable. Remark 2 is very brief and does not go into detail about how to calculate P1 and P2.
*   **Assumption 2 (Monotonicity of Utility Function):** While the monotonicity assumption is reasonable, it might be too restrictive for some applications. A discussion of the limitations of this assumption and potential alternatives would be helpful.
*   **Experimental Details:** While the downlink transmission experiments are useful, more details on the MDP parameters (e.g., state space size, transition probabilities, reward functions) would improve the reproducibility and comparability of the results. More discussion of the setting of hyperparameters would be valuable as well.
*   **Clarity of Proof Sketches:** The proof sketches are somewhat terse. Providing more detail, even in an appendix, would improve the accessibility of the theoretical results.
*   **Notation:** The paper uses a lot of notation, which may make it hard for a casual reader to follow. The list of symbols, their definitions, and the equations they appear in might be useful.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Simplify Theorem 1:** Provide a more intuitive explanation or a simplified version of Theorem 1 to highlight the key takeaways.
*   **Elaborate on Linear Decomposition:** Provide more practical guidance on how to obtain the linear decomposition model in real-world environments. Consider providing examples beyond the wireless access scenario.
*   **Discuss Limitations of Utility Function:** Discuss the limitations of the monotonicity assumption for the utility function and potential alternatives or extensions.
*   **Provide More Experimental Details:** Add more details about the MDP parameters, experimental setup, and hyperparameter settings for the experimental results.
*   **Expand Proof Sketches:** Provide more detailed proof sketches or include complete proofs in the appendix to improve accessibility.
*   **Add a Notation Table:** Consolidate the various symbols and their meanings in a single place, such as a notation table, to improve readability.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of reinforcement learning by addressing the challenge of large action spaces through action grouping and optimized abstraction. The theoretical analysis, counter-intuitive findings, and practical optimization approach make this a strong submission. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend acceptance, with a request for the authors to address the suggestions for improvement.
