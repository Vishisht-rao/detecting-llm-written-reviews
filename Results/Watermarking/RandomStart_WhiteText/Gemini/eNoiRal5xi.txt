OUTPUT:
The manuscript investigates a critical aspect of domain generalization (DG), namely the inconsistency between the loss landscapes of the source domain and unseen target domains. The paper proposes a novel approach called Unknown Domain Inconsistency Minimization (UDIM) to address this inconsistency. UDIM minimizes the loss landscape discrepancy between the source domain and synthetically generated "unknown" domains created by perturbing the source domain data. The paper provides theoretical justification for UDIM, showing that combining it with Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) can establish an upper bound on the target risk. Empirically, UDIM consistently outperforms SAM variants across various DG benchmark datasets, especially in scenarios with limited domain information.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The core idea of explicitly minimizing the inconsistency between source and "unknown" domain loss landscapes is novel and addresses a key limitation of existing SAM-based DG methods.
*   **Theoretical Justification:** The paper provides a theoretical upper bound for the target risk when combining SAM and UDIM, which adds credibility to the proposed approach.
*   **Empirical Validation:** UDIM consistently outperforms SAM variants across multiple DG benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in practice. The consistent gains over multiple datasets strengthens the validity of the approach.
*   **Strong Performance in Limited Domain Information Scenarios:** The significant improvements observed in scenarios with limited domain information highlight UDIM's ability to generalize to unseen domains, which is a key focus of the paper.
*   **Thorough Experiments:** The inclusion of both Leave-One-Out and Single Source Domain Generalization scenarios provides a comprehensive evaluation of UDIM's performance.
*   **Ablation Study:** The ablation study effectively demonstrates the contribution of each component of the UDIM objective.
*   **Sharpness Analysis:** The sharpness analyses visually and quantitatively support the claim that UDIM reduces sharpness in both parameter and data space, which ties back to the initial motivation.
*   **Well-written and organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the key ideas and results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Practicality of Worst-Case Domain Perturbation:** Emulating unknown domains by perturbing source data relies on the assumption that the worst-case unobserved domain lies within a bounded perturbation of the source domain. This assumption may not always hold in practice, and the effectiveness of UDIM could be limited by the quality of the emulated unknown domains. More discussion around the limitations of this emulation would be beneficial.
*   **Complexity:** The formulation and implementation of UDIM involves several hyperparameters (ρ, ρ', λ1, ρx), which may require careful tuning to achieve optimal performance. While the sensitivity analyses provide some guidance, a more detailed discussion of hyperparameter selection would be helpful.
*   **Computational Cost:** The computation of gradient variance using BackPACK adds to the computational cost of UDIM. Although the paper mentions that gradient variance is computed only for the classifier parameters to reduce the cost, a more explicit comparison of the computational overhead of UDIM compared to SAM variants would be valuable.
*   **Justification for Gradient Variance:** The approximation of the Hessian matrix with gradient variance, while based on prior work, could benefit from a more intuitive explanation. Why does matching gradient variances between two datasets encapsulate a specific form of loss matching? More concise justification would strengthen the paper.
*  **Comparison to Other Domain Augmentation Techniques:** While the visual inspection of perturbed instances is insightful, a more direct comparison of the quality and diversity of emulated domains generated by UDIM compared to standard domain augmentation techniques would be beneficial. Table 8 only provides an end-result comparison, not insights on why.
* **Unclear Connection to Inconsistency:** The equation 3 defining the inconsistency score $I_s^\gamma(\theta)$ is never further explained. This limits a better understanding of UDIM, especially since it is the method name.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Discussion of Limitations:** Explicitly address the limitations of the assumption that the worst-case unobserved domain is within a bounded perturbation of the source domain.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning Guidance:** Provide more detailed guidance on hyperparameter selection, including recommended ranges and strategies for tuning.
*   **Computational Cost Analysis:** Include a more explicit comparison of the computational overhead of UDIM compared to SAM variants.
*   **Clarify Gradient Variance Approximation:** Provide a more intuitive explanation for the approximation of the Hessian matrix with gradient variance.
*   **Comparison with Domain Augmentation:** Provide a more detailed comparison on what kind of information are being changed with the perturbations.
* **Explanation of Inconsistency Score:** Explain the impact of the equation 3 during implementation of the method.

**Overall:**

UDIM is a novel and promising approach to domain generalization that addresses a critical limitation of existing SAM-based methods. The paper provides strong theoretical justification and empirical validation for UDIM, demonstrating its effectiveness in practice. While there are some areas for improvement, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses, making it a valuable contribution to the DG literature. The idea of targeting the "unknown" domain inconsistency in the loss landscape is a significant step towards more robust and generalizable models. I recommend this paper to be accepted, with consideration of the above suggestions.
