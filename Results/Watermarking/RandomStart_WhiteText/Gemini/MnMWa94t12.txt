OUTPUT:
This study investigates a critical topic in scene understanding: learning dynamic neural scene representations from monocular videos. The paper introduces DyST (Dynamic Scene Transformer), a model that aims to decompose monocular real-world videos into scene content, per-view scene dynamics, and camera pose. The key idea is a novel co-training scheme on monocular videos and a new synthetic dataset, DySO, along with a "latent control swap" training methodology to encourage disentanglement.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses an important and challenging problem:** The paper tackles the difficult task of learning dynamic scene representations from monocular videos, a setting much closer to real-world scenarios than controlled multi-view environments. This is crucial for applications requiring spatial reasoning and interaction with the dynamic environment.
*   **Novel approach with latent control swap:** The core contribution of the latent control swap is innovative and well-motivated. Enforcing the separation of camera pose and scene dynamics through this training scheme is a key to the model's success, as demonstrated by the ablation study.
*   **Synthetic dataset DySO:** The introduction of DySO is a valuable contribution. Providing a synthetic dataset specifically designed for training dynamic neural scene representations will benefit the community and facilitate future research.
*   **Comprehensive evaluation:** The paper presents a thorough analysis of the model, including quantitative metrics like PSNR and a novel "contrastiveness" metric to evaluate latent space separation.  The qualitative results and ablation studies further support the claims.
*   **Demonstrates controllable video manipulation:** The experiments on motion freezing and video-to-video motion transfer highlight the practical utility of the disentangled representations learned by DyST.  This showcases the model's ability to manipulate video content in a meaningful way.
*   **Clear and well-written:** The paper is generally well-organized and easy to follow. The explanations of the method and experimental setup are clear.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited generation quality:** While the paper demonstrates successful disentanglement, the visual quality of the generated views, particularly for dynamic objects, appears to be limited, as acknowledged by the authors. The reliance on an L2 loss likely contributes to this issue.
*   **Lack of comparison to SOTA on related tasks**: While there's a thorough overview of related work, it would benefit from some comparisons with state-of-the-art novel view synthesis (NVS) or dynamic scene reconstruction methods, particularly in terms of quantitative performance (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS). Even if those methods work on different settings (e.g., multi-view, or with ground truth poses), some comparison, or discussion of why comparison is difficult, would be helpful.
*   **Reliance on synthetic co-training:** The performance is heavily dependent on the synthetic DySO dataset. The sim-to-real gap is still a concern, and the degree to which the specific characteristics of DySO influence the learned representations should be discussed. How the performance is affected by changing the synthetic data would be useful information.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address generation quality:** Discuss potential solutions to improve the generation quality, such as exploring alternative loss functions (e.g., perceptual loss, GAN-based losses, diffusion models). Add a paragraph detailing the known failure modes of the generation.
*   **More discussion on DySO dataset**: A deeper analysis of the DySO dataset and its impact on the learned representations would be valuable. For example, could the dataset design introduce any biases? Are there failure cases related to the dataset composition? Are there plans to make DySO more complex (more objects, etc.)?
*   **Include a failure analysis.**  Showing some failure cases would help understand the limitations of DyST.
*   **Broader Task-specific Evaluation:** It would also strengthen the paper to evaluate the scene representations on downstream tasks, such as object tracking or action recognition, to demonstrate their practical value beyond novel view synthesis.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of dynamic scene understanding. The proposed DyST model and the latent control swap training scheme are novel and effective. The paper is well-written and the experiments are thorough. While there are some limitations, the strengths of the paper outweigh the weaknesses.  I recommend acceptance, with consideration of the suggestions for improvement.
