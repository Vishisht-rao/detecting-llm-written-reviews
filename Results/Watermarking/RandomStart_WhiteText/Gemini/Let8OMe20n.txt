OUTPUT:
The research examines the aspect of confidence-aware reward optimization for fine-tuning text-to-image models, specifically addressing the problem of reward overoptimization.

**Strengths:**

*   **Relevant and Timely Problem:** The paper tackles a crucial challenge in fine-tuning text-to-image models: reward overoptimization. As these models become more prevalent, aligning them with human intent while avoiding performance degradation is critical.
*   **Novel Benchmark (TIA2):** The introduction of the Text-Image Alignment Assessment (TIA2) benchmark is a significant contribution. It provides a valuable resource for evaluating reward models and understanding their alignment with human preferences in the text-to-image domain. The benchmark's diversity (comprehensive, counting, composition sets) is a plus.
*   **Clear Empirical Demonstration of Overoptimization:** The paper convincingly demonstrates the adverse effects of excessive optimization against learned reward models. The empirical evidence, using several state-of-the-art reward models, strengthens the argument that overoptimization is a real concern, even with rewards trained on human preference data.
*   **TextNorm: A Simple and Effective Approach:** The proposed TextNorm method, based on confidence-calibrated rewards, is a simple yet effective way to mitigate overoptimization. The core idea of leveraging contrastive prompts to estimate model confidence is intuitive and well-motivated.
*   **Thorough Experimental Evaluation:** The paper presents a comprehensive set of experiments to validate the effectiveness of TextNorm. The evaluation includes both quantitative metrics (AUROC, AUPRC, AP, Spearman's ρ, Kendall's τ) and qualitative human evaluations. The experiments cover different optimization methods (best-of-n sampling, SFT, RL), further solidifying the results.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is clearly written and well-organized, making it easy to follow the problem, the proposed solution, and the experimental results. The figures and tables are helpful and informative.
*   **Good Ablation Studies:** The ablation studies investigating the impact of different prompt set types and the use of ensemble methods provide valuable insights into the design choices of TextNorm.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Reliance on External Models (LLMs, VLMs):** While TextNorm is presented as a simple method, its implementation relies on external models like LLMs (for contrastive prompt generation) and VLMs (for reward models). The paper acknowledges this limitation in the Ethics Statement, but it would be good to include a more in-depth discussion of the potential biases or limitations introduced by these external dependencies. A broader discussion of failure cases would be helpful.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The description of hyperparameter tuning seems limited. While the authors state they chose the "most improvement" for the KL coefficient in SFT, more detail about the process and range of tested values would be helpful for reproducibility. The same applies to TextNorm's temperature parameter and uncertainty penalty coefficient.
*   **Image Quality Trade-off with RL:** The human evaluation results show a trade-off between text-image alignment and image quality when using RL fine-tuning. While the paper suggests multi-objective reward modeling as a solution, further exploration of this trade-off, or potential ways to balance alignment and quality within TextNorm, would be beneficial.
*   **Limited Novelty in Ensemble Methods:** The ensemble methods used, while effective, visually resemble those proposed in concurrent work. A more detailed discussion of the differences and contributions of the ensemble approach in this context would strengthen the paper.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand the discussion of the limitations of relying on external models (LLMs and VLMs).** This could include an analysis of the potential biases these models introduce and a discussion of how to select the best models for specific tasks.
*   **Provide more details about the hyperparameter tuning process.** This would improve the reproducibility of the results and allow other researchers to build upon this work.
*   **Investigate the trade-off between text-image alignment and image quality when using RL fine-tuning.** This could involve exploring different ways to balance these objectives within TextNorm, or suggesting alternative RL algorithms that are better suited for this task.
*   **Clarify the novelty of the ensemble methods.** This could involve highlighting the differences between the proposed ensemble approach and those used in related work, and providing a more detailed analysis of the benefits of using an ensemble in this context.
*   **Consider adding a section visualizing the learned reward landscape.** Visualizing the reward function could provide additional insights into how TextNorm improves alignment and mitigates overoptimization.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that addresses an important problem in text-to-image model fine-tuning. The proposed TextNorm method is simple, effective, and well-evaluated. The introduction of the TIA2 benchmark is a valuable contribution to the field. While there are some areas for improvement, the paper is of high quality and is likely to have a significant impact on the development of text-to-image models. I recommend acceptance.
