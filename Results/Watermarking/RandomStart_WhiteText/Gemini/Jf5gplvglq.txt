OUTPUT:
This manuscript focuses on the key topic of evaluating the general-purpose capabilities of large language models (LLMs) beyond standard benchmarks susceptible to contamination and "cramming." The authors introduce SKILL-MIX, a novel evaluation method that assesses an LLM's ability to combine diverse skills in generating text on specific topics. The paper presents a well-defined methodology for constructing and administering the evaluation, including automatic grading with human spot-checking. The experimental results demonstrate the ability of SKILL-MIX to differentiate between models and reveal shortcomings not captured by existing benchmarks. The paper also offers intriguing evidence suggesting that GPT-4 exhibits behaviors beyond "stochastic parrot," a significant claim. Overall, the manuscript is well-written, thoroughly researched, and presents a valuable contribution to the field of LLM evaluation.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the review:

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** SKILL-MIX addresses a crucial gap in LLM evaluation by focusing on compositional generalization, a key aspect of general intelligence. The ability to combine skills is arguably more important than achieving high scores on individual benchmarks.
*   **Well-Defined Methodology:** The paper provides a clear and reproducible methodology for creating and administering SKILL-MIX, including:
    *   Curating skill and topic lists
    *   Prompt engineering for both generation and grading models
    *   Automated grading scheme with human spot-checking
*   **Rigorous Experimentation:** The authors evaluate a wide range of popular LLMs (including both proprietary and open-source models) across different difficulty levels (k values). The experimental setup is well-described, and the results are presented clearly.
*   **Intriguing Findings:** The experiments reveal several interesting findings:
    *   SKILL-MIX can differentiate between models with similar performance on standard benchmarks.
    *   Evidence of "cramming for the leaderboard" is found in some open-source models.
    *   GPT-4 demonstrates signs of going beyond "stochastic parrot" behavior, implying genuine skill combination.
*   **Ablation Studies:** The paper includes ablation studies to justify the design choices of SKILL-MIX, such as deducting points for mentioning skill names explicitly and filtering out common skills. These studies strengthen the validity of the evaluation.
*   **Future Directions:** The paper proposes a vision for a broader SKILL-MIX ecosystem with independent evaluations and secret skill/topic lists, which could be valuable for ongoing assessment of AI capabilities and deterring "cramming."
*   **Clear Writing and Organization:** The paper is well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the methodology and understand the results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Reliance on LLMs for Grading:** While the automated grading scheme is a significant advantage for scalability, it relies on the judgments of GPT-4 and LLaMA-2-70B-Chat. It would be great to see more robust human grading despite it being "noisy," the point is to compare with human ground truth. The authors acknowledge the limitations of LLM grading and use human spot-checking, but the potential for bias and inconsistencies should be further explored. The reliance on the models could invalidate the "beyond stochastic parrot" since the model grading the generated text may itself have seen those combinations in training.
*   **Simplified Skill Definition:** The paper assumes an independence between skills and topics. It is hard to prove mathematically.
*   **Generalizability:** It should be discussed how the conclusion may or may not apply to other benchmarks, or when applied to other tasks.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **More in-depth analysis of human grading:** The human grading could be compared with the model graders more in-depth.
*   **More Robust Statistical Analysis:** While the paper presents compelling evidence, incorporating more rigorous statistical analysis (e.g., statistical significance tests) would further strengthen the conclusions.
*   **Exploring the limitations of SKILL-MIX:** The paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion of the limitations of SKILL-MIX. What types of skills or capabilities are not well-suited for this evaluation method? Are there potential ways for models to "game" SKILL-MIX in the future?
*   **Release more prompts from the ablation studies:** Releasing the prompts can improve replicability.

**Overall Recommendation:**

I recommend accepting this manuscript for publication. SKILL-MIX represents a significant advancement in LLM evaluation, providing a valuable tool for assessing compositional generalization and identifying limitations not captured by traditional benchmarks. The paper is well-written, thoroughly researched, and offers intriguing insights into the capabilities of current LLMs. The suggested improvements would further strengthen the manuscript and enhance its impact on the field.
