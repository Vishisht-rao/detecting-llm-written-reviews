OUTPUT:
The research investigates the key aspect of image clustering by leveraging the power of pre-trained models and the principle of rate reduction. The paper addresses a significant gap in the field, namely the difficulty in clustering large-scale, uncurated image datasets effectively. The proposed pipeline, CPP (Clustering via the Principle of rate reduction and Pretrained models), integrates the image encoder from CLIP with a manifold learning framework (MLC) and introduces a novel method for estimating the number of clusters.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The idea of combining pre-trained features from models like CLIP with the rate reduction principle is novel. The paper tackles a relevant and challenging problem in unsupervised learning, which is clustering large-scale image datasets. This is a very practically relevant issue in a world awash with unlabeled image data. The ability to perform self-labeling and cluster captioning is also a strong point.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The paper presents a well-defined pipeline with clear explanations of each component. The use of Maximal Coding Rate Reduction (MCR2) principle provides a theoretical grounding for the method. The algorithm for estimating the number of clusters is a valuable contribution. The description of using doubly stochastic membership is also well-described. The link to the code repository enhances reproducibility.
*   **Experimental Results:** The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, with results on standard datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1k. The comparison with state-of-the-art deep clustering methods demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach. The experiments on MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetics, and WikiArt showcase the scalability and applicability of CPP to real-world, uncurated datasets. The image-to-image search visualization convincingly shows the improved feature structure. The ablation study is useful to understand the importance of different parts of the pipeline.
*   **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, with a clear introduction, related work section, method description, experimental results, and conclusion. The figures are informative and help to visualize the results. The discussion of limitations and future work is also appreciated.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Discussion of Computational Cost:** While the paper claims efficiency, a more thorough analysis of the computational complexity and resource requirements of CPP, especially for large-scale datasets, would be beneficial. Comparing the training/inference time to the benchmarks in Table 1/4 would be helpful. How does the cost scale compared to TEMI for example?
*   **Reliance on CLIP:** While leveraging CLIP is a strength, it also introduces a dependency. A more detailed discussion of the limitations imposed by CLIP's architecture and pre-training data would be valuable. How sensitive is CPP to the choice of pre-trained model? The addition of section A.1 helps address this issue.
*   **Text Candidate Selection Details:** The section on cluster captioning relies on text candidates generated by LLMs. The details of prompt engineering for the LLMs and the criteria for selecting relevant text candidates could be expanded. Are there any biases introduced by the LLM-generated text?
*   **Justification for Hyperparameter Choices:** While the appendix provides hyperparameter details, a more in-depth discussion of the rationale behind these choices and their impact on performance would be beneficial. A sensitivity analysis on key hyperparameters (e.g., gamma in Sinkhorn distance) would further strengthen the paper.
*   **Missing Related Work:** There are some recent related works on unsupervised domain adaptation and clustering that should be included and discussed. These include papers that use contrastive learning and pseudo-labeling for unsupervised clustering, and recent work on self-supervised learning for domain adaptation that also produces clusters (some of which are in ICLR 2024).

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand the discussion of computational cost and scalability.**
*   **Address the limitations of relying on CLIP's pre-trained features and biases.**
*   **Provide more details on the text candidate selection process and the potential for LLM biases.**
*   **Justify the hyperparameter choices and provide a sensitivity analysis.**
*   **Include and discuss recent related work on unsupervised domain adaptation and clustering.**

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of image clustering. The proposed CPP pipeline is novel, technically sound, and experimentally validated on a variety of datasets. Addressing the identified weaknesses would further strengthen the paper and make it more impactful.

**Rating:**

I would recommend this paper for acceptance at ICLR 2024, with the suggestion that the authors address the identified weaknesses in their revision.
