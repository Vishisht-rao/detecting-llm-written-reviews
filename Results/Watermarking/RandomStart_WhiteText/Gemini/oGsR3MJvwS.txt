OUTPUT:
This manuscript investigates a critical aspect of deep reinforcement learning for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP): generalization to larger problem instances than those seen during training. The paper proposes a novel DRL method, TS3, that leverages approximate invariances (specifically focusing on k-nearest neighbors and data augmentation with transformations) to improve generalization performance. The method combines local and global views of the TSP instance and uses a Transformer-based model trained with a modified policy gradient algorithm. The authors also explore integrating TS3 with Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in a method named TS4. Extensive experiments on TSP-Random and TSPLIB datasets demonstrate superior generalization performance compared to several existing DRL-based TSP solvers.

**Strengths:**

*   **Important Problem:** The paper addresses a critical limitation of DRL-based TSP solvers: poor generalization to larger problem sizes. Improving generalization is essential for practical applications.
*   **Novel Approach:** The idea of exploiting approximate invariances, particularly the focus on k-nearest neighbors and the use of data augmentation, is a novel and well-motivated approach to enhance generalization.
*   **Clear Explanation:** The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed method, including the architecture (TS2), training algorithm (TS3), and integration with MCTS (TS4). The figures are helpful in understanding the architecture.
*   **Comprehensive Experiments:** The experiments are comprehensive, including evaluations on both synthetic (TSP-Random) and real-world (TSPLIB) datasets. The comparison with several baseline methods provides a strong benchmark.
*   **Ablation Study and Sensitivity Analysis:** The ablation study demonstrates the importance of the different components of the proposed method, while the sensitivity analysis shows that the performance is robust to variations in hyperparameters.
*   **Well-Written:** The paper is generally well-written and organized.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited novelty in MCTS integration:** The MCTS integration seems somewhat incremental, building upon existing work. While the authors acknowledge this, further justification for the specific choices made in the MCTS implementation could be beneficial.
*   **Incomplete comparison with model-search methods:** While the performance of TS4 is compared against DIMES+MCTS and AttGCRN+MCTS, the authors admit they do not provide a systematic evaluation of model-search methods. This makes it difficult to definitively conclude the superiority of TS4 over all state-of-the-art methods, especially considering the increased computational overhead associated with MCTS. The authors should either perform a more thorough comparison with relevant model-search approaches or temper the claims about TS4's overall performance.
*   **Some claims need more nuanced support:** The claim about "dominant performance" should be refined, especially when considering that the method doesn't always achieve the *best* performance on smaller instances (e.g. Table 1, TSP-20, TSP-50, TSP-100, and on small TSPLIB instances). This needs to be clarified, emphasizing that the strength lies in generalization to *larger* instances.
*   **Concerns on time complexity of TS3:** The table shows TS3 often being slower than other pure DRL methods. It is still faster than LKH3, so the authors are trading-off time and quality. Some discussion about time and memory requirements would be helpful.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand on MCTS integration:** Provide more details about the choices made in the MCTS implementation and justify why this particular approach was chosen. Discuss potential avenues for further improving the MCTS component.
*   **Refine the claims about performance:** Be more specific about the strengths of the proposed method, emphasizing the superior generalization performance on larger problem instances. Acknowledge the limitations on smaller instances.
*   **Address the time complexity:** Discuss the computational overhead of the proposed method, particularly the trade-off between solution quality and inference time. Consider analyzing the time complexity of the different components of the method.
*   **Minor Edits:**
    *   There are some inconsistent naming conventions. "TS3" is used to describe the training algorithm, while "TS2" is the architecture. Maybe it would make sense to describe the architecture as TS3 (renaming TS2 to TS3) and name the MCTS-based scheme something else.

**Overall Recommendation:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of DRL for TSP, addressing a critical limitation related to generalization. The proposed method is novel, well-explained, and supported by comprehensive experiments. Despite the minor weaknesses identified above, the paper is of sufficient quality to warrant acceptance at ICLR 2024, pending revisions to address the suggestions outlined above.
