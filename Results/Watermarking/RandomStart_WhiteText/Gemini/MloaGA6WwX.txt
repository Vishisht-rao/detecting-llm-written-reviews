OUTPUT:
The manuscript focuses on the key context of experimental design in multi-channel imaging, addressing the need for efficient acquisition schemes that minimize costs and acquisition time while maximizing task performance. The paper introduces TADRED, a novel task-driven experimental design method for image channel selection, and demonstrates its effectiveness across diverse imaging applications.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The paper proposes a novel paradigm for experimental design that moves beyond traditional model-parameter estimation and directly optimizes for user-specified image analysis tasks. This is a significant contribution to the field, particularly in imaging where various tasks exist, not just parameter estimation. TADRED offers a practical solution to a challenging problem with real-world implications.
*   **Task-Driven Approach:** The task-driven approach is a major strength. Instead of focusing solely on model parameters, the design is optimized to support the specific downstream task. This allows for greater flexibility and potential for application to a wider range of imaging problems, including "model-free" tasks like image reconstruction.
*   **Coupled Optimization:** The simultaneous optimization of the design (channel selection) and the machine-learning model (task execution) is a crucial aspect of the method. This allows for a more direct and efficient approach to experimental design compared to methods where feature selection and model training are performed separately.
*   **Thorough Evaluation:** The paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of TADRED across six datasets/tasks in both MRI and hyperspectral imaging. The comparisons against classical experimental design methods, recent application-specific results, and state-of-the-art feature selection approaches demonstrate the superiority of TADRED.
*   **Clarity of Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and the method is explained in a clear and logical manner. The algorithm description is detailed, and the inclusion of the forward/backward pass (Algorithm 1) and the overall optimization procedure (Algorithm 2) enhances the reproducibility and understanding of TADRED.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors have released the code and provided thorough information on the implementation of TADRED and the baselines, including hyperparameters and data preprocessing, which improves the reproducibility of the results. The use of publicly available datasets strengthens the reproducibility argument.
*   **Ablation Study:** The ablation study demonstrates the importance of the components of TADRED, and the experiments on the effect of randomness are reassuring, showing that the method is mostly robust to variations in deep learning training.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Discussion of Limitations:** While the authors acknowledge that TADRED might underperform compared to other feature selection algorithms on datasets that are *not* imaging data, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of other potential limitations. What types of imaging tasks might TADRED *not* be well suited for? Are there specific properties of the data (e.g., very high noise levels, significant artifacts) that could negatively impact TADRED's performance?
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** Although fixed hyperparameters were used across experiments to avoid cherry-picking, it might be beneficial to at least examine and report the sensitivity of the method to a few key hyperparameters, even with a brief discussion of how those hyperparameters were selected.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand Discussion of Limitations:** Add more detail about the limitations. Discuss data-specific challenges, or scenarios where it might underperform.
*   **Consider Alternative Feature Selection Strategies:** While the paper justifies the choice of RFE, exploring alternative strategies or perhaps combinations of feature selection methods might be interesting.
*   **Cost Function Complexity:** Discuss the potential implications of TADRED's adaptability to more complex cost functions (mentioned in the discussion). Provide some specific examples of cost functions that might be relevant in practical applications.
*   **Potential Negative Societal Impacts (Broader Impact Statement):** Consider adding a sentence or two about the potential broader impacts. Reducing scanning time can improve patient comfort and increase access to diagnostic imaging.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach to experimental design in multi-channel imaging. The method is well-motivated, clearly explained, and thoroughly evaluated. The release of the code enhances the reproducibility and impact of this work. While the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of limitations and the potential for more complex cost functions, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. This paper is a valuable contribution to the field and is well-suited for publication at ICLR.
