OUTPUT:
This article explores an important context of differentially private federated linear contextual bandits, addressing critical issues in existing state-of-the-art algorithms. The paper tackles the problem by designing a generic algorithmic framework with flexible privacy protocols and provides strong theoretical guarantees under silo-level LDP and shuffle DP. The practical relevance is supported by numerical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Identification:** The paper clearly identifies and articulates three key weaknesses in Dubey & Pentland (2020): failure of claimed privacy protection due to adaptive communication schedule, an incorrect regret bound resulting from noise miscalculation, and an ungrounded communication cost analysis. This critique is well-supported.
*   **Novel Algorithmic Framework:** The proposed two-step approach, involving a generic federated LCB algorithm and flexible privacy protocols, provides a solid foundation for addressing the identified issues. The algorithm's fixed-batch schedule and the distributed tree-based privacy protocol are innovative elements.
*   **Strong Theoretical Results:** The paper rigorously establishes privacy and regret guarantees under silo-level LDP, correcting the errors in the state-of-the-art. The achievement of nearly "optimal" regret under shuffle DP, with two different schemes (privacy amplification via shuffling and integration of a shuffle protocol into the tree-based mechanism), is a significant contribution. The new privacy amplification lemma tailored to Gaussian DP mechanisms is a highlight.
*   **Practical Validation:** The empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets provide compelling evidence to support the theoretical results, illustrating the performance differences between LDP and SDP under various privacy budgets.
*   **Clarity and Organization:** The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it relatively easy to follow the complex concepts and technical details. The introduction effectively sets the context and outlines the contributions. Table 1 provides a useful summary of the main results.
*   **Thorough Related Work:** The related work section is comprehensive, covering various DP models and federated learning approaches relevant to the problem. The discussion on user-level vs. item-level privacy and comparison with Huang et al. (2023) is particularly insightful.
* **Address Communication Challenges:** Addresses the challenges present in existing algorithms by switching to a fixed-batch communication scheme which has a privacy advantage.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Communication Cost Trade-off:** While the fixed-batch communication schedule resolves the privacy leakage, it results in a higher communication cost compared to the potentially logarithmic cost of data-adaptive approaches. The paper acknowledges this trade-off but doesn't offer concrete solutions for achieving both privacy and low communication cost. This is mentioned as future work.
*   **Complexity of Implementation:** The practical implementation of the proposed privacy protocols (especially those involving shuffling and tree-based mechanisms) could be challenging, especially in resource-constrained federated learning environments. More discussion on the practical considerations of implementing these protocols could be beneficial.
* **Small Epsilon/Delta Range:** Under SDP results via amplification lemma the epsilon and delta ranges are limited. It may be of benefit to explore ways to expand this range or make a clearer indication that these values must be low.
* **Notations:** The notations can sometimes be difficult to follow. A consistent legend of notations may help the user to be able to better understand the equations and descriptions.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Communication Cost:** Provide a more detailed discussion on potential avenues for achieving lower communication costs while maintaining privacy. This could include exploring alternative adaptive communication strategies that address the privacy leakage issue or investigating communication-efficient implementations of the proposed fixed-batch schedule.
*   **Implementation Considerations:** Elaborate on the practical challenges of implementing the privacy protocols, such as computational overhead, memory requirements, and communication bandwidth limitations. Discuss potential optimizations or simplifications that could make the algorithms more deployable in real-world federated learning settings.
* **Highlight Key Contributions:** Although the paper is well-written, it can benefit from clearly and concisely highlighting the core contributions and novel findings. By emphasizing these key elements, the paper can better showcase its significance and impact on the field.
* **Notation clarification:** It would help to make sure notations are clearly defined and that they remain consistent throughout the paper.
* **Regret tight characterization discussion:** Although the paper notes the importance of the tight characterization, more discussion could be had on why the problem is difficult.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes significant contributions to the field of differentially private federated linear contextual bandits. The paper's thorough analysis, innovative algorithmic framework, strong theoretical guarantees, and practical validation make it a valuable contribution. The identified weaknesses offer directions for future research and further improvements to the proposed approach.
