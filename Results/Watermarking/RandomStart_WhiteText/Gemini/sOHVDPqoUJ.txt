OUTPUT:
This manuscript examines the key context of parameter-efficient finetuning, specifically focusing on selecting a subset of layers for training while freezing the rest. The authors propose a method called SubTuning, which leverages a "finetuning profile" to identify important layers and uses a greedy algorithm for layer selection. The paper presents results suggesting that SubTuning outperforms full finetuning and linear probing, especially in low-data regimes and with corrupted data. It also explores the application of SubTuning in multi-task learning.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Problem Definition:** The paper clearly identifies the trade-offs between linear probing and full finetuning and proposes SubTuning as a middle ground.
*   **Intuitive Approach:** The idea of a "finetuning profile" is intuitive and provides a valuable tool for understanding layer importance.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The paper includes experiments across various tasks, architectures, and pre-training methods, which strengthens the claims. The VTAB-1k results and the CIFAR-10-C experiments are particularly compelling.
*   **Multi-Task Learning Application:** The application of SubTuning to multi-task learning and the discussion on efficient inference are relevant and interesting. The section on computational efficiency provides a good discussion on the additional compute cost of SubTuning.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the main ideas.
*   **Theoretical Motivation:** The inclusion of a theoretical justification for SubTuning, particularly in the low-data regime, adds depth to the paper. The generalization error bound is a valuable contribution.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Greedy Algorithm Limitations:** While the greedy algorithm is efficient, it might not always find the globally optimal subset of layers. The paper acknowledges this but could benefit from a more thorough discussion of the potential limitations of the greedy approach.
*   **Layer Selection Overhead:** The paper mentions the training cost associated with selecting layers but could provide a more detailed analysis of this overhead. How does the time spent on layer selection compare to the time saved during finetuning? While not the main focus, it is still important to have a more in-depth analysis and ideally include a plot of the convergence time for training and validation during the greedy approach.
*   **Dependency on the Finetuning Profile:** The entire method hinges on the accuracy of the finetuning profile. If the initial finetuning profile is inaccurate, the layer selection might be suboptimal. The paper could discuss the sensitivity of SubTuning to noise or errors in the finetuning profile and methods to mitigate such issues.
*   **Lack of Novelty in Some Aspects:** The related work section adequately discusses parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) methods. While the authors highlight the differences between SubTuning and prior work, the core idea of selective layer finetuning isn't entirely novel (as acknowledged by the reference to Lee et al.). The primary contributions lie in the finetuning profile analysis, the greedy selection algorithm, and the MTL application. It's crucial to emphasize these contributions clearly.
*   **Missing Ablation Studies:** While the experiments are comprehensive, the paper would benefit from ablation studies to better understand the impact of different components of SubTuning. For instance, how does performance vary with different values of ε (the threshold for the greedy algorithm)? What happens if the finetuning profile is constructed using a smaller validation set? The ablation study in the Appendix is helpful, but more can be added.
*   **Inference Time Measurement Details:** The inference time measurements are a critical aspect of the MTL application. While the paper mentions the A100 GPU and batch size, it would be beneficial to include more details about the measurement process (e.g., number of runs, standard deviation of measurements) and the software environment (e.g., PyTorch version, CUDA version).
*   **Appendix Theorem 1:** The assumption made in Theorem 1 that  r' << r should be validated. Also, the term "generalization error" should be properly defined. It is implied to mean the difference between the loss of the test data and the training data.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Discuss Limitations:** A more detailed discussion of the limitations of the greedy algorithm and the sensitivity of SubTuning to the accuracy of the finetuning profile.
*   **Analyze Layer Selection Overhead:** Provide a more detailed analysis of the training cost associated with layer selection and compare it to the savings during finetuning.
*   **Add Ablation Studies:** Include ablation studies to evaluate the impact of different components of SubTuning (e.g., different values of ε, different validation set sizes for the finetuning profile).
*   **Provide More Inference Time Details:** Include more details about the inference time measurement process and the software environment.
*   **Clarify Contribution:** The exact novel contribution of SubTuning could be better defined. Specifically, by addressing the concerns about selective layer finetuning not being novel, the authors can demonstrate how SubTuning advances the field.
*   **Improve the Writing on Siamese Subtuning:** The section should be written to better motivate why the original features are used as input to the new tasks.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of parameter-efficient finetuning. The SubTuning method, along with the finetuning profile analysis and the MTL application, offers a practical approach for adapting pretrained models to new tasks, especially in low-data regimes. By addressing the weaknesses and incorporating the suggestions for improvement, the paper can be further strengthened and have a greater impact on the research community. I recommend acceptance, conditional on addressing the above concerns.
