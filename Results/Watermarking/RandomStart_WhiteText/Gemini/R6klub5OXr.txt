OUTPUT:
The paper examines the problem of understanding the underlying premises behind deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm design, specifically focusing on the assumption of monotonic performance transfer between data-abundant and data-limited regimes. The authors argue that this assumption is often implicit and overlooks the possibility that algorithms designed for high-data regimes may not perform optimally in low-data scenarios. They provide theoretical arguments and empirical evidence to support their claim.

Here's a breakdown of the review:

**Strengths:**

*   **Important and Timely Problem:** The paper addresses a crucial issue in the DRL field. As the field matures, understanding the limitations and applicability of different algorithms in various data regimes is vital. The paper's focus on the often-unspoken assumption of performance transfer is highly relevant.
*   **Clear Research Questions:** The research questions are clearly stated and directly address the problem outlined in the introduction.
*   **Combined Theoretical and Empirical Approach:** The paper's strength lies in its combination of theoretical analysis and empirical validation. The theoretical section attempts to provide mathematical justification for the observed performance differences.
*   **Large-Scale Experiments:** The experiments conducted in the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) provide a comprehensive evaluation of various DRL algorithms in both low-data and high-data settings.
*   **Critical Analysis of Existing Work:** The paper critically examines the existing literature, highlighting instances where the implicit assumption of monotonic performance transfer may have led to misleading conclusions or inflated performance claims.  The discussion of DRQ is particularly insightful and raises important questions about how research is presented and interpreted.
*   **Detailed Experimental Details:** The inclusion of implementation and hyperparameter details are good. This increases the reproducibility of the results, which is essential.
*   **Well-Written:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it relatively easy to follow the authors' arguments.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Theoretical Depth:** While the theoretical analysis provides some mathematical motivation, it could be further strengthened. The linear function approximation setting, while having provable regret bounds, is a significant simplification of the deep learning setting used in the empirical evaluation. The connection between the theory and the deep RL experiments is somewhat weak.  A deeper connection to the neural network properties that might lead to the observed non-monotonicity would significantly improve the paper.
*   **Clarity of Theorem 3.2 Interpretation:** The implication of Theorem 3.2, specifically how it suggests lower-capacity models might outperform higher-capacity models in low-data, should be more clearly explained.  The link to practical algorithm design choices could be made more explicit.
*   **Algorithm Selection:** The paper focuses mainly on Q-learning based methods. While this is a valid starting point, exploring other DRL paradigms, like policy gradient methods, would make the analysis more comprehensive. Are the observed effects specific to value-based methods, or are they more general?
*   **Limited Discussion of *Why* Non-Monotonicity Occurs:** The paper demonstrates *that* non-monotonicity exists, but it could delve deeper into *why* it occurs.  Possible reasons, such as overfitting in high-capacity models in low-data regimes, could be explored in more detail. This would move the paper beyond observation and towards a more explanatory understanding.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning Discussion:** The paper mentions not tuning hyperparameters for baselines. While this can be a fair starting point, it could be argued that a *small* amount of tuning for the dueling architecture *in the low data regime* could offer additional insights, even if it's to show the difficulty of getting significant improvements in the limited data setting. The lack of tuning could lead to underestimation of the baseline's capabilities.
*   **"Implicit Assumption" Framing:** While the authors highlight an important oversight, framing it as an "implicit assumption" might be too strong.  Often, researchers are simply focusing on problems where high data is available, and the question of low-data transfer is a separate, but related, research question.  A more nuanced framing might be more accurate.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Strengthen the connection between theory and experiments:** Either expand on the theory to better reflect the deep learning setting, or add experiments that more directly test the theoretical claims (even if simplified).
*   **Investigate the *why* of non-monotonicity:** Dedicate more discussion to the potential causes of the observed performance differences. This could involve analyzing learned representations or examining training dynamics.
*   **Consider additional DRL paradigms:** Include policy gradient methods in the analysis.
*   **Conduct limited hyperparameter tuning (or justify its omission more thoroughly):** A small amount of tuning for the baselines in the low-data regime could provide additional insights. Even if the tuning doesn't yield significant improvements, it would address a potential criticism.
*   **Soften the "Implicit Assumption" framing:** A more nuanced discussion of the existing literature could be beneficial.
*   **Explain Theorem 3.2 more clearly.**

**Overall Recommendation:**

This is a strong paper that addresses an important and timely problem in deep reinforcement learning. The combined theoretical and empirical approach is valuable, and the critical analysis of existing work is insightful. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in strengthening the theoretical connection and exploring the reasons behind the observed non-monotonicity, the paper's contributions are significant.

**I recommend accepting the paper, conditional on addressing the weaknesses outlined above.** Specifically, I would recommend focusing on the connection between theory and experiments and discussing the potential causes of the observed non-monotonicity in the high- and low-data regimes. The framing of the "implicit assumption" should also be carefully considered.
