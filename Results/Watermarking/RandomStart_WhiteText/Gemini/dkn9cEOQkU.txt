OUTPUT:
This research examines the problem of fragmentary interaction in real-time reinforcement learning control scenarios, where communication delays or packet loss lead to intermittent state observations. The paper proposes a novel framework called Multi-step Action Representation (MARS) to address this challenge by learning a compact and decodable latent space for multi-step actions. The key idea is to generate multiple actions simultaneously to account for potential future state unobservability. MARS employs a scale-conditioned variational autoencoder (sc-VAE) and incorporates unsupervised environmental dynamics prediction and action transition scale information to enhance the learned action representation. The paper evaluates MARS against baselines in various simulated environments and demonstrates its superior performance, even in real-world robotic control tasks.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Relevance:** The paper tackles a practical and important problem in applying RL to real-world, real-time control scenarios. Fragmentary interaction is a common issue that can significantly degrade performance.
*   **Novelty:** The proposed MARS framework is a novel approach to handling fragmentary interaction by learning a representation space for multi-step actions.  The combination of the sc-VAE with environmental dynamics and action transition scales seems promising.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the MARS framework, including the sc-VAE architecture, the loss functions, and the integration with RL algorithms like TD3.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper presents a thorough experimental evaluation across various simulated tasks (Mujoco and D4RL navigation) and a real-world robotic control task. The comparisons to reasonable baselines (frameskip and advance decision) provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of MARS. The ablation studies effectively demonstrate the contribution of different components.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to understand the problem, the proposed solution, and the experimental results. The figures and tables are helpful in visualizing the concepts and results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Writing Style:** While generally clear, the writing could be improved in certain areas. Some sentences are awkwardly phrased or contain minor grammatical errors. The frequent use of acronyms (e.g., HFRT) without consistent definition can be distracting. The paper could benefit from a careful proofread.
*   **Justification for Design Choices:** While the motivation is explained, the reason behind some specific design choices in MARS could be further elaborated. For instance, the specific form of the action transition scale (Eq. 3) and the choice of using state transition *residuals* for dynamics prediction could benefit from more in-depth justification.
*   **Limited Discussion of Limitations:** While the results are impressive, the paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion of the limitations of MARS. For example, how sensitive is MARS to the choice of latent space dimension? Are there specific types of environments or tasks where MARS might struggle? The authors do touch on the limitations concerning excessively long sequences, which is good. More of this type of analysis is encouraged.
*   **Overclaiming (Minor):** The claim of MARS being "the *first* DRL framework... simultaneously achieving all three properties outlined in Tab.1" might be slightly overstated. While MARS might be the first to *explicitly* design a framework with these properties in mind, it's possible that existing methods, perhaps with some modifications, could achieve similar results.
*   **Appendix Overload:** Much useful information is relegated to the appendix (e.g., details on network architecture). Some of this information (like a more detailed explanation of why environment dynamic representation is better than reward/Q-value clustering) would improve the main body of the paper.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Proofread and Refine Writing:** Carefully proofread the paper for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inconsistencies in terminology.
*   **Elaborate Justification for Design Choices:** Provide more detailed explanations for the design choices in MARS, particularly the action transition scale and the use of state transition residuals.
*   **Expand Discussion of Limitations:** Include a more thorough discussion of the limitations of MARS, including sensitivity to hyperparameters, potential failure cases, and computational complexity.
*   **Move Important Details from Appendix to Main Paper:** Consider moving some of the more important implementation details (e.g., network architecture, justification of representation clustering method) from the appendix to the main body of the paper to improve readability and completeness.
*   **Code Availability:** Clearly state the plan for code availability (e.g., whether the code will be open-sourced and when).

**Overall Score:**

I would rate this paper as a **6 (Marginally Above Average)**. The paper presents a novel and effective approach to addressing a challenging problem in real-world RL. The technical details are sound, and the experimental results are convincing. While there are some areas for improvement, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field. With some revisions, this paper could be a valuable addition to the ICLR 2024 conference.
