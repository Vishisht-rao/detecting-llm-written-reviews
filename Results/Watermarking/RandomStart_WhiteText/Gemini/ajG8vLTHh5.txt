OUTPUT:
The article explores the context of learning brain network representations from fMRI data using deep learning, specifically addressing limitations of existing fixed and dynamic functional connectivity (FC) approaches. The authors propose BrainMAE, a novel method combining embedding-informed graph attention and masked autoencoding to capture temporal dynamics and mitigate noise inherent in fMRI data. The paper presents promising results, demonstrating superior performance compared to baselines on downstream tasks and offering interpretable insights.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The proposed BrainMAE approach is a novel combination of techniques borrowed from NLP and computer vision, adapted specifically for fMRI data. The integration of embedding-informed graph attention with masked autoencoding is a unique contribution.
*   **Problem Addressed:** The paper clearly identifies and addresses a relevant problem in the field, namely the limitations of existing methods in capturing temporal dynamics and handling noise in fMRI data.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper includes a thorough evaluation of BrainMAE, including pre-training evaluation (masked signal reconstruction, ROI embeddings analysis) and transfer learning evaluation on three diverse downstream tasks (behavior prediction, age prediction, task performance prediction). Ablation studies further validate the importance of each component of the model.
*   **Strong Results:** BrainMAE consistently outperforms established baselines by a significant margin on the downstream tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning transferable and informative representations.
*   **Interpretability:** The paper highlights the interpretability of the model by analyzing model-generated representations, revealing intriguing findings that align with existing neuroscience research. This provides valuable insights into the model's learned features and their relevance to brain function.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, with a clear explanation of the proposed approach, experimental setup, and results. The figures and tables are informative and easy to understand.
*   **Strong Motivation** The functional specificity, connectivity and inter-individual consistency of ROIs are well motivated and argued as advantages of the approach.

**Weaknesses and Suggestions:**

*   **Clarity in Embedding Learning:** While the paper mentions learning ROI embeddings, more details could be provided regarding the specific optimization process and loss function used during the initial embedding learning phase (before the masked autoencoding pre-training). Clarifying how the embeddings are initialized and updated would be beneficial.
*   **Computational Cost:** The paper could benefit from a discussion of the computational cost associated with pre-training and fine-tuning BrainMAE. Providing information about training time, GPU requirements, and model size would be valuable for readers considering implementing the approach.
*   **Generalizability Discussion:** While the paper demonstrates better generalizability to different fMRI pre-processing pipelines than the baselines, more discussion about the limitations of the model's generalizability would strengthen the work. For example, how well does the model generalize to data from different scanner types or different patient populations?
*   **Ablation Vanilla-BrainAE**: It is not totally clear why "vanilla-BrainAE" is worse than "vanilla-BrainMAE", a slightly more detailed discussion here would be helpful.
*   **Significance level** Some more discussion of significance level of the results would be helpful.

**Minor Comments:**

*   **Abstract:** "network of Regions of interest (ROIs)": should be "network of *regions* of interest (ROIs)"
*   **Introduction:** "high spatial and temporal resolution": fMRI has *good* spatial resolution but *relatively poor* temporal resolution compared to EEG/MEG.
*   **Equation 1:** It could be helpful to define what the output of s is, which is assumed to be a scalar here.
*   **Figure 3:** The figure caption is misleading - the principal gradient is NOT derived from the FC.
*   Table 1-3 formatting inconsistent vs Table 4-5.
*   Figure 2 caption is repeated from the previous line.
*   Minor typo Table 8. TR(s) should be Original TR(s).

**Overall:**

This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of brain network analysis using deep learning. The proposed BrainMAE approach is novel, well-evaluated, and demonstrates promising results. Addressing the suggested weaknesses would further strengthen the paper. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
