OUTPUT:
The manuscript addresses the key aspect of improving neural surface reconstruction accuracy by refining camera poses, which are often noisy in real-world scenarios. The paper introduces a novel Pose Residual Field (PoRF), an MLP-based implicit representation for regressing pose updates, and incorporates an epipolar geometry loss to enhance supervision using feature correspondences. The method is evaluated on DTU and MobileBrick datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over existing pose refinement techniques and achieving state-of-the-art performance on MobileBrick.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Approach:** The PoRF is a novel and well-motivated approach to pose refinement. Using an MLP to learn pose residuals and leveraging global information through parameter sharing is a key contribution.
*   **Robustness:** The method demonstrates improved robustness to initial pose errors compared to existing joint pose and NeRF optimization techniques (BARF, SPARF, L2G), as shown in the ablation studies.
*   **Efficiency:** The epipolar geometry loss utilizes readily available correspondences (e.g., from COLMAP) without incurring significant computational overhead. The flexibility to use sparse or dense correspondences is also a plus.
*   **Strong Results:** The experimental results on both DTU and MobileBrick are compelling. The paper showcases substantial improvements in pose accuracy and reconstruction quality. The integration into Nerfstudio further demonstrates the generalizability and practicality of the approach.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation with quantitative and qualitative results, ablation studies, and comparisons to several state-of-the-art methods. The ablation studies are particularly helpful in understanding the contributions of different components of the method.
*   **Clear Writing:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The introduction clearly outlines the problem, the proposed solution, and the contributions.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Novelty in Epipolar Loss:** While the combination with PoRF is novel, the use of epipolar geometry loss itself is not entirely new in the context of pose refinement (SPARF also uses correspondences). The distinction from SPARF needs to be emphasized more strongly, beyond just computational cost and reliance on NeRF depth.  A more in-depth comparison of *why* the epipolar geometry loss is more effective when used with PoRF compared to SPARF's approach would strengthen the paper.
*   **Lack of Depth on Loss Weight Selection:** The paper mentions a hyperparameter β that controls the weight of the epipolar geometry loss.  The process for selecting this value could be more detailed. Is it scene-dependent? How sensitive is the performance to this parameter?
*   **Training Time:** The training time of 2.5 hours for 50,000 iterations is significant. While mentioned as a limitation, exploring ways to reduce this in future work (as the paper suggests) is crucial for wider adoption.
*   **Minor Translation Improvement:** The paper acknowledges only a minor improvement in translation accuracy. While rotation is more crucial for reconstruction, it would be beneficial to discuss potential reasons for this and directions for future research to improve translation accuracy.
*   **Dependency on Dense Views and Good Initialization:** The limitations section states the need for nearly dense views and robust initial pose estimation. This needs to be stated earlier, perhaps even in the abstract, to properly scope the contributions of the paper.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Elaborate on Differences from SPARF:**  Provide a more detailed comparison to SPARF, focusing on the differences in how correspondences are used and why PoRF complements the epipolar geometry loss better than SPARF's architecture.
*   **Discuss β Hyperparameter Tuning:**  Explain the process for selecting the value of β (the weight for epipolar loss). How sensitive is the performance to this parameter?
*   **Acknowledge Limitations Earlier:**  Mention the dependency on nearly dense views and a good initial pose estimation earlier in the paper (e.g., in the abstract and introduction).
*   **Analyze Translation Performance:**  Provide further discussion on why the method shows less improvement in translation accuracy and suggest potential avenues for future research in this area.
*   **More Visualization of Correspondences:** Consider adding a figure that visualizes the correspondences used in the epipolar geometry loss to show the inliers vs. outliers and the distribution of matches.
*   **Include More Details on Dataset Normalization:** Provide a few more details on the normalization pre-processing step used when dealing with 360 captures.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective method for refining camera poses to improve neural surface reconstruction. The experimental results are compelling, and the ablation studies provide valuable insights into the method's performance. Addressing the weaknesses listed above would further strengthen the paper and make it an even more valuable contribution to the field.
