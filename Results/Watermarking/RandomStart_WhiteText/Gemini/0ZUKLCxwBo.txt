OUTPUT:
The study explores the key context of grokking in neural networks, specifically focusing on modular arithmetic tasks. The paper presents a simplified, interpretable model that exhibits grokking behavior, aiming to provide mechanistic understanding of this phenomenon. The authors identify a specific architecture (two-layer MLP) and optimization process (vanilla gradient descent) that leads to grokking on modular arithmetic problems, even without explicit regularization. They also provide analytical expressions for the weights that solve a large class of modular arithmetic tasks and show that gradient descent and AdamW can find similar solutions. This allows for complete interpretability of the learned representations.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear and Focused Research Question:** The paper directly addresses the question of what causes grokking and proposes a concrete, testable hypothesis.
*   **Simplicity and Interpretability:** The model is intentionally simple, allowing for analytical solutions and a clear understanding of the learned representations. This is a major strength, as it contributes significantly to mechanistic interpretability.
*   **Analytic Solutions:** The derivation of analytic expressions for the weights is a significant contribution. It allows for a direct understanding of the network's computation and provides a benchmark for the solutions found by optimization algorithms.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The paper provides strong empirical evidence to support the theoretical claims. The experiments show that gradient descent and AdamW can find solutions similar to the analytic ones.
*   **Comprehensive Exploration:** The authors explore various modular functions, optimizers, and regularization methods, providing a thorough analysis of the grokking phenomenon.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the arguments and understand the results.
*   **Thorough Literature Review:** The authors provide a comprehensive overview of related work, situating their contributions within the existing literature.
*   **Attention Heads Generalization:** The work on Attention heads grokking and the generalization jumps is a significant result that adds a new dimension to the mechanistic understanding of Grokking
*   **Good Use of Figures:** The figures effectively illustrate the experimental results and support the claims made in the paper.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Generalizability:** The model is highly specific to modular arithmetic tasks. It is not clear whether the insights gained from this model can be generalized to more complex, real-world datasets and tasks.
*   **Over-Simplification:** While the simplicity of the model is a strength for interpretability, it may also be an oversimplification of the factors that contribute to grokking in more complex neural networks.
*   **Computational Resources:** Some claims in the paper depend on prolonged training of models. Access to computational resources might be a limitation for reproduction of results.
*   **Some Claims Require Further Justification:** While the paper presents convincing evidence for its claims, some statements could benefit from further elaboration and justification. For instance, the complexity classifications discussed in the conclusion could be more rigorously defined.
*   **Dependence on Random Phases:** The analytic solution relies on the assumption of random phases. While the experiments show that this assumption holds approximately, a more rigorous understanding of the role of these phases would be beneficial.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Discuss Limitations More Explicitly:** The paper acknowledges the limitations of the model in the discussion section. However, it would be beneficial to discuss these limitations more explicitly throughout the paper, particularly in the introduction and conclusion.
*   **Explore Generalization to Other Algorithmic Datasets:** While the focus on modular arithmetic is justified by its simplicity and interpretability, it would be valuable to explore whether the insights gained from this model can be generalized to other algorithmic datasets.
*   **Investigate the Role of Initialisation:** Although the paper mentions the dependence on initialization, a detailed analysis of the role of weight and phase initialization would strengthen the arguments.
*   **Address Potential Concerns about Reproducibility:** Given the long training times and sensitivity to hyperparameters, it would be helpful to provide more details about the experimental setup and hyperparameter tuning process to improve reproducibility.
*   **Expand the Discussion of Complexity:** The discussion of complexity classes for modular functions could be more rigorously defined, potentially by drawing connections to computational complexity theory.
*   **Provide More Intuition for the Analytic Solution:** While the derivation of the analytic solution is impressive, it is not immediately intuitive why this solution works. Providing more intuition behind the solution would make it more accessible to a wider audience.
*   **Include error bars or other measures of uncertainty** Figures would be more useful if they contained more information.

**Overall Assessment:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the understanding of grokking. The authors present a simple, interpretable model that allows for analytical solutions and a clear understanding of the learned representations. The empirical results support the theoretical claims, and the paper is well-written and organized. While the model has limitations in terms of generalizability, the insights gained from this work are valuable and pave the way for future research on grokking. I recommend accepting this paper for publication, pending minor revisions to address the weaknesses and suggestions for improvement listed above.

**Recommendation:** Accept with minor revisions.
