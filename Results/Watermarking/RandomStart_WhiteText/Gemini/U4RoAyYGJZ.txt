OUTPUT:
This manuscript investigates the area of on-policy reinforcement learning and proposes a method called Proximal Robust On-Policy Sampling (PROPS) to improve data efficiency by using off-policy sampling to generate on-policy data. The core idea is to adaptively adjust the sampling distribution to counteract sampling error, where some actions are under-sampled. The paper claims that PROPS reduces sampling error and improves the data efficiency of on-policy policy gradient algorithms, demonstrated through experiments on MuJoCo benchmark tasks and discrete-action tasks.

**Strengths:**

*   **Interesting and Relevant Problem:** The paper addresses a fundamental challenge in on-policy RL â€“ the trade-off between the need for on-policy data and the inefficiency of discarding off-policy data. The observation that "on-policy learning requires on-policy data, not on-policy sampling" is insightful.
*   **Well-Motivated:** The introduction clearly explains the problem of sampling error and motivates the use of adaptive, off-policy sampling. The walking example in Section 4 is helpful in illustrating the concept.
*   **Clear Explanation of PROPS:** The paper provides a reasonable explanation of the PROPS algorithm, building upon the ROS algorithm of Zhong et al. (2022). The description of how PROPS addresses the limitations of ROS is clear.
*   **Empirical Evaluation:** The paper includes a thorough empirical evaluation on various benchmark tasks. The experiments cover both sampling error reduction and data efficiency. The comparison with PPO and PPO-BUFFER provides useful insights.
*   **Ablation Studies:** The ablation studies examining the effects of clipping and regularization are valuable in understanding the contribution of each component of PROPS.
*   **Comprehensive Appendix:** The appendices provide a lot of extra information, which makes the paper a lot more understandable.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Algorithm Novelty:** PROPS appears to be primarily an adaptation of existing techniques (ROS and PPO). While the combination is novel and shows empirical improvements, the algorithmic contribution could be perceived as incremental. It would benefit the paper to clarify the specific innovations and engineering contributions made in PROPS to scale ROS for policy learning.
*   **Justification for Design Choices:** Some design choices, like the specific form of the LCLIP loss function (Eq. 4), could benefit from more detailed justification. Why this particular clipping strategy? Why not other alternatives?
*   **Limited Theoretical Analysis:** While the paper builds upon the theoretical foundation of Zhong et al. (2022), it lacks a dedicated theoretical analysis of PROPS. It would be helpful to provide some theoretical guarantees or insights into the convergence properties of PROPS. For example, does PROPS inherit any of the theoretical advantages of ROS?
*   **Runtime Concerns:** Appendix G suggests PROPS is slower than vanilla PPO. Although the speed is better than that of SAC, the speed concerns, combined with the incremental nature of the algorithm, raise questions.
*   **Comparison to Off-Policy Algorithms:** Appendix H provides a useful comparison to SAC. However, given that PROPS aims to leverage off-policy sampling, a more direct comparison and discussion of the trade-offs between PROPS and other off-policy algorithms in the main body of the paper would be beneficial. Why choose PROPS over SAC, especially considering SAC often achieves higher data efficiency?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Emphasize Novelty:** Better articulate the key innovations and engineering contributions of PROPS, especially in the context of scaling ROS to policy learning.
*   **Justify Design Choices:** Provide more detailed reasoning behind the specific design choices of PROPS, especially the LCLIP loss function. Consider discussing alternative design options and why the chosen approach was preferred.
*   **Provide Theoretical Insights:** Attempt to provide some theoretical analysis or insights into the convergence properties of PROPS. Even a brief discussion of the potential benefits or limitations from a theoretical perspective would be helpful.
*   **Discuss Limitations and Future Work:** Expand the discussion of limitations in Section 7, addressing the potential impact of runtime and the need for careful hyperparameter tuning. Elaborate on the planned direction for future work of prioritizing advantage for selecting corrective actions.
*   **Revisit Clarity of Writing:** While the writing is generally clear, some sections could benefit from further simplification and streamlining.

**Overall:**

The paper presents an interesting approach to improving data efficiency in on-policy RL by using off-policy sampling to generate on-policy data. The empirical results are promising, and the ablation studies provide useful insights. However, the paper could be strengthened by clarifying the algorithmic novelty, providing more justification for design choices, and including some theoretical analysis.

**Rating:**

6: Marginally above the acceptance threshold.  The paper is reasonably well-written and presents interesting results, but it has some weaknesses that need to be addressed.
