OUTPUT:
The article investigates the key problem of cross-domain recommendation (CDR) when only implicit feedback is available in both source and target domains, a setting the authors term CDRIF. This is a practical and timely problem since explicit feedback is often sparse or unavailable in real-world applications. The authors observe that existing CDR algorithms perform poorly in the CDRIF setting due to the noisy nature of implicit feedback, and propose a Noise-Aware Reweighting Framework (NARF) to address this. NARF consists of two main components: Implicit Feedback Calibration (IFC) and Dynamic Noise Reduction (DNR). The authors conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrating the superior performance of NARF compared to baselines. The paper is well-written and clearly presents the problem, proposed solution, and experimental results.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Significance:** The paper tackles a significant and practical problem in cross-domain recommendation. CDRIF is a realistic scenario that is often overlooked.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is well-organized and easy to follow. The problem definition, proposed method, and experimental setup are clearly explained.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The proposed NARF framework is well-motivated and addresses the challenges of noisy implicit feedback. The IFC and DNR components seem effective in mitigating the noise.
*   **Extensive Experiments:** The authors perform comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, providing strong evidence for the effectiveness of NARF. The ablation study provides further insights into the contribution of each component.
*   **Code Availability:** The availability of the code is a major plus, allowing for reproducibility and further research.
*   **Good Writing Quality:** The writing is clear, concise, and grammatically sound.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Novelty of Components:** While the overall framework (NARF) is novel in the context of CDRIF, the individual components (IFC and DNR implemented using AD/CTD) seem to borrow heavily from existing techniques.  The main novelty comes from the *application* of these techniques to the specific problem of implicit feedback in cross-domain recommendation and the specific combination of techniques.  This should be more clearly articulated in the paper.
*   **Limited Discussion of Alternatives within NARF:** The paper touches on the flexibility of NARF (e.g., different calibration functions), but doesn't explore this systematically. Are some calibration functions significantly better than others?  What are the tradeoffs in choosing different denoising strategies (AD vs. CTD)?  A deeper dive into these choices would strengthen the paper.
*   **Calibration Factor Justification:** The justification for the calibration factor in Eq. 14 could be made more rigorous. While popularity can be indicative of a user's potential interest, it's not a perfect proxy. A brief discussion of the limitations of this approach and potential improvements would be beneficial.
*   **Denoising Strategy Justification:** Similarly, the discussion in the last paragraph of the 'Understanding of NARF' section seems a bit hand-wavy. Why do positive pairs in implicit datasets contain more valuable information than negative pairs? Is there empirical support or theoretical justification for this?  More detail here would be helpful.
*   **Limited Comparison to SOTA Implicit Feedback Methods *within* the target domain:** While the paper does a good job of showing that existing *cross-domain* methods don't work well, there's little discussion of how well the NARF+CDR combination fares compared to just training a state-of-the-art *single-domain* implicit feedback method (e.g., LightGCN, or a modern matrix factorization technique) on the target domain. This comparison would help to justify the benefits of cross-domain transfer in this setting.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Clarify Novelty:** Explicitly state that the main novelty lies in the application of existing noise-handling techniques to the specific problem of CDRIF, and the specific combination of IFC and DNR.
*   **Explore NARF Component Variations:** Include a small experiment or discussion exploring different calibration functions or denoising strategies within the NARF framework.
*   **Strengthen Calibration Factor Justification:** Provide a more rigorous justification for the chosen calibration factor in Eq. 14, and discuss its limitations.
*   **Provide more detail on the denoising strategy:** Add more empirical or theoretical backing on why only denoising positive pairs is a worse strategy than denoising both when working with implicit feedback.
*   **Compare to SOTA Single-Domain Methods:** Include a comparison of NARF+CDR to state-of-the-art single-domain implicit feedback methods trained on the target domain data only.
*   **Expand discussion about the limitations:** Briefly discuss the limitations of the NARF framework and potential future research directions.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that addresses an important and practical problem in cross-domain recommendation. The proposed NARF framework is effective in mitigating the noise inherent in implicit feedback, leading to significant performance improvements. Addressing the minor weaknesses and suggestions outlined above would further strengthen the paper and make it an even more valuable contribution to the field.
