**Review of "SYNAPSE: Trajectory-as-Exemplar Prompting with Memory for Computer Control"**

**Summary:**

This paper introduces SYNAPSE, a novel LLM-powered computer agent designed for improved computer control. SYNAPSE tackles limitations of existing ICL-based agents by incorporating three key components: state abstraction, trajectory-as-exemplar (TaE) prompting, and exemplar memory. State abstraction reduces the complexity of raw computer states, allowing for more exemplars within LLM context windows. TaE prompting utilizes complete successful trajectories as exemplars, enhancing multi-step decision-making. Exemplar memory stores and retrieves relevant trajectories based on similarity search over task metadata, facilitating generalization to new tasks. The paper presents thorough evaluations on MiniWoB++ and Mind2Web benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods. The study focuses on an important problem.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses a Significant Problem:** The paper tackles a crucial and timely problem: enabling LLMs to effectively control computers for complex tasks. This is a key step towards building more versatile and autonomous AI systems.
*   **Novel Approach:** The proposed SYNAPSE architecture is innovative and well-motivated. The combination of state abstraction, TaE prompting, and exemplar memory provides a compelling solution to the limitations of previous ICL methods.
*   **Clear and Well-Structured:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to understand the proposed approach and the experimental setup. The figures (especially Figure 1 and 2) are helpful in visualizing the system's architecture and the benefits of TaE prompting.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The experimental results are impressive and demonstrate the effectiveness of SYNAPSE. The significant performance gains on both MiniWoB++ and Mind2Web, compared to strong baselines, provide compelling evidence for the approach's superiority. The ablation studies clearly show the contribution of each component.
*   **Human-Level Performance:** Achieving human-level performance on MiniWoB++ with an ICL method is a notable accomplishment.
*   **Generalization:** The exemplar memory component explicitly addresses and demonstrates the ability to generalize to novel tasks, a key weakness in many prior computer control agents.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors have made their code, prompts, and agent trajectories publicly available, which is commendable and promotes reproducibility.
*  **Complete experiments section:** The experiments section is really detailed. It is appreciated that a failure example is also mentioned, as it's more fair and shows the reader where further improvements may be more needed.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **State Abstraction Detail:** While the paper describes state abstraction, the specifics of *how* the explicit abstraction is done (e.g., the exact prompts used for LLM-based abstraction, details of few-shot examples) could be elaborated upon. It also depends on GPT-4 and can be expensive to collect.
*   **Computational Cost:** The reliance on LLMs inevitably leads to high inference latency, which is acknowledged. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the computational cost of SYNAPSE, especially in terms of API calls and memory usage, and compare with other methods.
*   **Memory Scalability:** The exemplar memory is a valuable component, but the paper does not fully address the scalability of the memory as the number of tasks and trajectories increases. How does the retrieval time scale, and what strategies could be employed to maintain efficiency with a very large memory?
*   **Error Analysis:** While the paper mentions some failure cases, a more in-depth error analysis could provide valuable insights into the limitations of SYNAPSE and guide future research. Are there specific types of tasks or websites where it struggles?
*   **Limited Memory Exploration:** The memory retrieval is currently based on simple similarity search of task metadata. It might be interesting to explore more advanced memory structures (e.g., hierarchical memory) and retrieval processes to improve generalization and adapt to diverse tasks.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Provide More Detail on State Abstraction Prompts:** Include examples of the prompts used for state abstraction, and discuss the process of selecting appropriate prompts.
*   **Discuss Computational Cost in More Detail:** Quantify the computational cost of SYNAPSE and compare it to other methods.
*   **Address Memory Scalability:** Discuss the potential scalability challenges of the exemplar memory and suggest strategies for mitigating them.
*   **Conduct a More Detailed Error Analysis:** Analyze the failure cases of SYNAPSE to identify its limitations and guide future improvements.
*   **Explore Advanced Memory Structures:** Investigate the use of more sophisticated memory structures and retrieval processes.

**Overall Assessment:**

SYNAPSE represents a significant advancement in LLM-based computer control. The paper is well-written, the proposed approach is novel and well-motivated, and the empirical results are strong. Despite some limitations, SYNAPSE has the potential to make a real impact on the development of more versatile and autonomous AI systems. I recommend acceptance.
