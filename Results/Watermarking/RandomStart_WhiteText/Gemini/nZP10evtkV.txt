OUTPUT:
The article examines an important aspect of adversarial attacks on neural networks, specifically focusing on adversarial patches and their transferability across different network architectures. The authors propose a novel distribution-oriented approach based on optimal transport to generate more transferable adversarial patches, addressing a significant limitation of existing patch attacks. The paper includes extensive digital, hybrid, and physical experiments to validate the proposed method, demonstrating its effectiveness against a wide range of models, including robustified networks and in real-world scenarios.

Here's a breakdown of the paper's strengths and weaknesses:

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The use of optimal transport for adversarial patch generation is a novel and promising approach. Shifting the focus from decision boundaries or specific feature points to feature distributions is a key contribution to improving transferability.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper presents a comprehensive evaluation across various network architectures (CNNs, Transformers), training recipes (standard, adversarially trained), and real-world conditions (digital, scanned, physical).
*   **Strong Experimental Results:** The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing adversarial patch techniques in terms of transferability and robustness. The ablation studies and analysis of hyperparameter impact provide valuable insights.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the methodology and experimental setup.
*   **Addresses an Important Problem:** Improving the transferability of adversarial attacks is crucial for understanding the vulnerabilities of deployed systems.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Computational Cost:** While the authors address the computation time, optimal transport methods can be computationally intensive. Further optimization or alternative formulations might be needed for very large-scale applications.
*   **Data Dependency:** The dependency on multiple images of the target class to construct the target distribution is a potential limitation. This is correctly highlighted and could be an issue for rare classes with limited data.
*   **Clarity of Certain Methodological Details:** The exact details of how the loss gradients are normalized and combined (mentioned under "Experimental setup") could benefit from a more explicit explanation.
*   **Limited Discussion of Defenses:** While the paper includes evaluation against Local Gradients Smoothing (LGS), a broader discussion of different defense mechanisms and their potential impact on the proposed attack would be valuable.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **More Explicit Loss Function Formulation:** A more formal mathematical definition of the overall loss function, including the weights for the adversarial loss and TV loss, would enhance clarity.
*   **Discussion of Scalability:** A brief discussion of the scalability of the proposed approach to larger datasets or more complex models would be beneficial.
*   **Comparison with Other Distribution-Based Attacks (if applicable):** If there are existing adversarial attack methods that also operate on distributions (even if not patch-based), a brief comparison would help contextualize the contribution.
*   **Clarify Layer Selection Process:** In Section 4.4, when the attack is applied on different layers, it would be good to clarify how these layers are selected in detail (e.g., by referencing layer names in a specific model architecture definition), as this is somewhat unclear for non-experts.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of adversarial attacks. The proposed method addresses a critical limitation of existing adversarial patch techniques, and the extensive experimental results provide compelling evidence of its effectiveness. The paper is well-written and organized, making it accessible to a broad audience. The identified weaknesses are relatively minor and do not detract significantly from the overall value of the work. I recommend this paper for acceptance at ICLR 2024.
