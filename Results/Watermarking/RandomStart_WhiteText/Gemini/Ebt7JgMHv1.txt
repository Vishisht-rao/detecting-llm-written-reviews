OUTPUT:
This manuscript investigates an important aspect of mechanistic interpretability: the potential for "interpretability illusions" when using subspace activation patching. The authors convincingly demonstrate that patching along a seemingly relevant subspace can have the intended end-to-end effect on model behavior without actually targeting the causally relevant feature. This occurs by activating a dormant parallel pathway through a component causally disconnected from the model output. They illustrate this phenomenon with a mathematical example, and then empirically demonstrate it in two settings: indirect object identification (IOI) and factual recall. The paper also provides a counter-example in the IOI task, demonstrating successful subspace patching with proper validation, and explores the connection between their findings and rank-1 fact editing. Overall, the paper is well-written, clearly explains a complex issue, and offers valuable insights for researchers working on mechanistic interpretability.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel and Important Contribution:** The paper identifies and thoroughly investigates a potential pitfall in using subspace activation patching, a widely used technique in mechanistic interpretability. The concept of interpretability illusions is a crucial one for the field to address.
*   **Clear Explanations:** The authors do a good job of explaining the complex interactions that lead to the illusion, both conceptually and mathematically. The figures (especially Figure 1) are helpful in understanding the underlying mechanism.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The paper provides strong empirical evidence for the illusion in two different tasks. The experiments are well-designed and the results are convincing. The contrast between the illusory and faithful subspaces in the IOI task is particularly compelling.
*   **Connection to Existing Work:** The authors connect their findings to existing work on rank-1 fact editing and interpretability illusions in other areas of machine learning. This helps to contextualize their contribution and highlight its significance.
*   **Practical Recommendations:** The paper offers practical recommendations for avoiding interpretability illusions when using subspace activation patching. This makes the paper useful for researchers who are actively working on mechanistic interpretability.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' line of reasoning.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Scope of Tasks:** While the IOI and factual recall tasks are relevant, exploring the illusion in a wider range of tasks could further strengthen the paper's conclusions. Would the findings generalize to tasks involving more complex reasoning or different model architectures?
*   **Reliance on GPT-2:** The study focuses primarily on GPT-2. While this is a common model for interpretability research, it would be interesting to see if the illusion is also present in larger, more modern models.
*   **The "Prevalence" Argument could be bolstered:** Section 7 offers arguments on why the illusion ought to be prevalent, but these are informal and somewhat speculative. Providing further empirical evidence, even if preliminary, could strengthen this section. It would be good to include a checklist of potential factors that might make interpretability illusion more likely to occur, allowing interpretability researchers to check before they investigate a component of the network.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand the Empirical Evaluation:** If possible, conduct experiments on a wider range of tasks and model architectures.
*   **Strengthen the Prevalence Argument:** Provide more concrete examples or empirical evidence to support the claim that the illusion is prevalent in practice. Consider adding a checklist to help identify vulnerable networks.
*   **Discuss potential mitigation strategies:** The paper focuses on identifying the illusion. It could be helpful to discuss potential mitigation strategies beyond those already mentioned, such as regularization techniques or alternative training objectives.
*   **Clarify the role of Overfitting:** The authors suggest the effect is strongest when overfitting to a small dataset. While the empirical results seem to support this claim, it could be discussed in more detail. Is there a way to quantify the level of overfitting required for the illusion to occur?

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of mechanistic interpretability. The authors have identified and thoroughly investigated an important pitfall in using subspace activation patching, and their findings have important implications for future research. The paper is well-written, clearly explains a complex issue, and offers valuable insights for researchers working on mechanistic interpretability. The suggestions for improvement are relatively minor and would only further strengthen an already excellent paper. I recommend acceptance.
