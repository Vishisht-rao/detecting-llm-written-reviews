OUTPUT:
This research focuses on the key context of fine-tuning Transformer models by linearizing them around a pre-trained initialization. The paper introduces Tangent Attention Fine-Tuning (TAFT), a method that leverages a first-order Taylor expansion to create a linear "Tangent Transformer." The core idea is to efficiently compute the Jacobian-Vector Product (JVP) in a single forward pass, making training and inference comparable in cost to the original non-linear Transformer. The paper argues that this linearization, combined with a convex fine-tuning loss, allows for advantages in model composition, parallel training, machine unlearning, and differential privacy.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The paper proposes a novel approach to linearizing Transformer models, which is a significant contribution to the field. Applying linearization techniques to the Transformer architecture in a computationally efficient way is a key advance.
*   **Efficiency:** The method's ability to compute the JVP in a single forward pass is a substantial advantage. This efficiency makes the approach practical for larger Transformer models, a limitation of previous linearization methods.
*   **Theoretical Justification:** The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation for the benefits of TAFT, particularly regarding model composition, unlearning, and privacy. The convexity of the loss function after linearization is crucial for these benefits.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The experimental results demonstrate that TAFT can achieve comparable or even better performance than non-linear fine-tuning on several downstream tasks. The experiments on model composition, unlearning, and privacy provide empirical evidence for the claimed advantages.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and clearly explains the methodology and the experimental setup. The derivations in the appendix help to solidify the technical contributions.
*   **Reproducibility:** The paper provides a link to the code, which promotes reproducibility and allows other researchers to build upon this work.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Performance on Distant Datasets:** The paper acknowledges that TAFT's performance degrades on datasets that are "far" from the pre-training data. While this is expected, it highlights a limitation of the method. More discussion about how to choose the initialization point and the trade-offs involved would be beneficial.
*   **Inference Cost:** Although the JVP calculation is efficient, the need for a modified forward pass could potentially double the inference cost. The paper mentions that linearizing only the last attention block can mitigate this, but a more detailed analysis of the actual inference time increase in different scenarios would be helpful. The caching strategy to alleviate training cost increase should be discussed more prominently in the main paper.
*   **Parameter Sensitivity:** The method's performance seems to depend on the choice of hyperparameters, especially the re-initialization of the last attention layer and the use of RSL. While the paper provides ablation studies, further investigation into the sensitivity of TAFT to different hyperparameters would strengthen the results. In particular, how does the performance change if one was to use TAFT to linearize the last two attention blocks, as opposed to just one?
*   **Scalability to Very Large Models:** While the method addresses computational challenges with Transformers, the scalability to very large language models is not explicitly addressed. Although the authors claim that their linearization is more efficient than other methods, they should discuss their method's potential limitations at the extreme scale.
*   **Sharding Trade-offs:** The paper discusses trade-offs in performance on minority classes with the sharding method. This issue could be explored in more depth, perhaps with suggestions for addressing it in future work.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **More detailed discussion of choosing the linearization point:** The choice of weights around which the model is linearized is a crucial factor. The paper could benefit from a more extensive discussion on how to select this point, considering the distance between the pre-training and downstream tasks. Perhaps an approach to measuring or predicting the "distance" between datasets would be helpful.
*   **Comparative Analysis with Alternative Fine-tuning methods:** The performance comparison with full fine-tuning provides a baseline, but the work could be strengthed by including a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art parameter efficient transfer learning techniques such as adapters or LoRA. This comparison would allow the reader to better contextualize the performance of TAFT.
*   **Explicitly Address Model Size and Task Complexity:** Further elaboration on the scalability of the method to large models and whether performance is retained on very complex downstream tasks is important.
*   **Elaborate on limitations/assumptions:** This will allow the user to better contextualize the scope of the method.

**Overall:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of Transformer fine-tuning. TAFT is a novel and efficient method for linearizing Transformers, offering advantages in composition, unlearning, and privacy while maintaining competitive performance. Despite some limitations, the paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, making it a worthwhile contribution to the conference.
