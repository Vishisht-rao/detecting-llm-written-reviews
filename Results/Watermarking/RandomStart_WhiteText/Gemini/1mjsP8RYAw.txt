OUTPUT:
The article examines an important topic: unsupervised pre-training for fact verification, a crucial task given the proliferation of misinformation. The paper introduces SFAVEL, a novel framework leveraging language model distillation and a contrastive loss to achieve state-of-the-art results on FB15k-237 and FEVER datasets using only unsupervised pre-training. While the approach shows significant promise and offers compelling results, there are aspects of the paper that could be strengthened to improve clarity and impact.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Approach:** The idea of using language model distillation for unsupervised fact verification is innovative. SFAVEL presents a well-defined methodology for transferring knowledge from large LMs to smaller, task-specific models without relying on labeled data.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The paper demonstrates significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods on standard fact verification benchmarks. The +8% accuracy gain on FEVER and the +5.3% Hits@1 on FB15k-237 are substantial and validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
*   **Ablation Studies:** The inclusion of ablation studies helps to understand the contributions of different components of the loss function and architectural choices. This provides valuable insights into the design rationale behind SFAVEL.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors provide a link to the source code, promoting reproducibility and allowing other researchers to build upon their work.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity of Methodology:** While the overall approach is understandable, some aspects of the methodology require further clarification. For example, the process of "verbalizing" a triplet for the LM, as mentioned in relation to obtaining FLM_j, could be explained in more detail. The rationale behind the specific hyperparameters and the chosen architectures could also be elaborated.
*   **Negative Instance Generation:** The description of the negative instance generation process (in-batch and in-knowledge-base negatives) is somewhat dense and could benefit from more illustrative examples. A clearer explanation of the rationale behind choosing specific perturbations and sampling strategies would improve understanding. The motivation behind the H hops sampling is not clear.
*   **Limited Analysis of Failure Cases:** While the paper focuses on positive results, it would be beneficial to include a brief discussion of the limitations of the approach and potential failure cases. Analyzing instances where SFAVEL performs poorly could provide valuable insights for future research directions.
*   **Justification of Model Selection:** The selection of the Relational Graph Attention Network (RGAT) as the knowledge model is not explicitly justified. A comparison or discussion of why RGAT was chosen over other graph embedding techniques would be helpful. The impact of different knowledge model architectures is also not assessed.
*   **Baseline comparison could be expanded.** Although the paper shows improvement over the SOTA, the discussion about why it outperforms these baselines is lacking. What architectural biases or training strategies contribute to SFAVEL's success, which are lacking from the prior work?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand on Methodology:** Provide more detailed explanations and illustrative examples for key steps in the methodology, particularly the verbalization of triplets and the negative instance generation process.
*   **Justify Design Choices:** Explain the rationale behind specific architectural choices, hyperparameter settings, and the selection of the RGAT model. Compare different architectures for the knowledge model to motivate architectural choices.
*   **Analyze Failure Cases:** Include a brief discussion of the limitations of the approach and potential failure cases, offering insights for future research.
*   **Expand on results' comparison with baselines:** Add more discussion and analysis of the ablation study results and comparisons with baseline performance. What contributions of SFAVEL provide a performance boost over prior works?

**Overall:**

This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of unsupervised fact verification. SFAVEL is a novel and effective framework that achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks. While the paper could benefit from improved clarity and more detailed explanations in certain areas, the strong empirical results and the potential for future research make it a valuable contribution to the ICLR conference.
