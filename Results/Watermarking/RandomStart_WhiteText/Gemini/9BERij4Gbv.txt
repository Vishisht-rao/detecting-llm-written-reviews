OUTPUT:
This study explores the key context of guiding evolutionary search for machine learning programs using a binary discriminator trained online. The paper proposes a novel approach, PAM-RT, that combines a binary relation predictor with an adaptive mutation strategy to speed up the convergence of evolution in diverse ML component search spaces. The method is evaluated on symbolic regression, ML optimizers, RL loss functions, and NAS, demonstrating significant speedups compared to regularized evolution.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The paper introduces a promising approach for guiding evolution with online-trained binary discriminators. The PAM-RT algorithm, particularly the re-tournament mechanism, presents a unique way to leverage the discriminator's predictions for efficient search.
*   **Broad Applicability:** The method demonstrates versatility by applying the same graph representation and GNN-based predictor to a wide range of ML components, including symbolic optimizers, neural architectures, RL loss functions, and symbolic regression equations. This generality is a significant strength.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The paper presents compelling experimental results across diverse problem domains. The reported speedups on ML optimizers (3.7x) and RL loss functions (4x) are substantial and demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed method. The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the importance of different design choices, such as the mutation strategy and the choice of GNN architecture.
*   **Thorough Ablation Studies:** The ablation studies on the impact of binary vs regression predictors, and the type of GNN architecture used are very useful in understanding the contribution of each component.
*   **Empirical Analysis:** The emperical analysis helps the reader understand why the proposed method leads to improvements in the search.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Theoretical Analysis:** While the paper provides some intuition for the hill-climbing properties of PAM-RT, a more rigorous theoretical analysis of its convergence properties and search behavior would strengthen the work. A deeper understanding of when and why PAM-RT outperforms regularized evolution would be beneficial.
*   **Reliance on Graph Representation:** The method relies on converting ML components into DAGs. While the paper shows it's possible for various components, the overhead of this conversion and its potential impact on the search space structure could be discussed more explicitly. Are there limitations on the types of ML components that can be effectively represented as DAGs? The paper could also elaborate on the impact of the graph representation on GNN's ability to accurately discriminate between program pairs.
*   **Scalability Concerns:** While the experiments demonstrate promising results, the scalability of the method to even larger and more complex search spaces remains an open question. The computational cost of training the binary discriminator online and the complexity of GNN inference could become bottlenecks.
*   **Limited comparison to related work:** The related work section mentions relevant papers but could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the similarities and differences between the proposed method and existing approaches, particularly regarding performance predictors and evolutionary algorithms for NAS. How does PAM-RT compare to other techniques that combine predictors with evolution, such as those that use predictors to rank a list of candidates? The differences should be more clearly articulated.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Provide a more in-depth analysis of the limitations of the DAG representation.** Address the overhead and potential limitations in representing specific ML components as DAGs.
*   **Address scalability concerns.** Discuss the potential challenges and mitigation strategies for scaling the method to larger and more complex search spaces.
*   **Expand the discussion on the model's false negatives.** The empirical analysis highlights a high number of false negatives. Investigate further the possible reasons and propose techniques to address the false negatives.
*   **Include a failure case analysis.** Add examples of situations where PAM-RT struggles or fails to improve upon regularized evolution.
*   **Provide pseudo code for key components.** Provide psuedocode for other major components of the proposed method such as Algorithm 2.
*   **More detail on the compute requirements:** The paper mentions that it focuses on smaller training configurations to train optimizers on a language modelling task in less than 10 minutes on a GPU. Details on the number of gpus and the type would be useful.
*   **Typos/Grammar:** The writing quality is generally good, but a careful proofread could eliminate minor typos and grammatical errors.

**Overall:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of AutoML by introducing a novel and effective approach for guiding evolutionary search with binary discriminators. The empirical results demonstrate the potential of the method to speed up the discovery of better ML programs. Addressing the identified weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements would further enhance the quality and impact of the paper.
