OUTPUT:
The manuscript explores the key problem of tabular data machine learning, where, despite the advancements in deep learning, tree-based ensemble models remain state-of-the-art. The paper introduces GRANDE, a novel gradient-based decision tree ensemble method designed to leverage the advantages of both tree-based models and gradient-based optimization for tabular data. The paper proposes a dense representation of decision trees, enabling end-to-end gradient descent training via backpropagation with a straight-through operator. The authors also introduce an instance-wise weighting technique to improve the model's ability to learn both simple and complex relationships. An extensive evaluation is performed on a predefined benchmark, demonstrating that GRANDE outperforms existing gradient-boosting and deep learning frameworks on most datasets.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses a relevant problem:** The paper directly tackles the challenge of creating effective and flexible tabular data methods, an area where deep learning has not yet surpassed tree-based methods.
*   **Novel approach:** GRANDE introduces a unique approach by combining hard, axis-aligned decision trees with end-to-end gradient-based optimization. The dense representation and use of the straight-through operator are interesting contributions.
*   **Instance-wise weighting:** The introduction of instance-wise weighting is a valuable addition. It allows individual trees to specialize in different regions of the feature space and focus on specific types of relations.
*   **Extensive evaluation:** The paper includes a comprehensive evaluation on a predefined benchmark, addressing the concerns of biased evaluations in tabular data research. The use of a 5-fold cross-validation and multiple metrics improves the reliability of the results.
*   **Clear presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and explains the technical details of GRANDE clearly. The figures help visualize the concepts, such as the differentiable split functions and the architecture.
*   **Code availability:** The availability of the code is crucial for reproducibility and further research.
*   **Case study on interpretability:** Showcases the ability of instance-wise weighting to produce local explanations and enhance model interpretability.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity on ST operator details:** While mentioned, the specific implementation and nuances of the straight-through operator could be more elaborated upon. The reader would benefit from a more detailed explanation of how gradients are propagated through the non-differentiable operations.
*   **Computational complexity:** While the authors mention efficient computation via parallelization, a more in-depth analysis of the computational complexity of GRANDE compared to XGBoost, CatBoost, and NODE would be helpful. Specifically, provide a scaling relationship between the runtime and input features/samples. Also, explain the memory usage characteristics of GRANDE compared to others.
*   **Justification for hyperparameter choices:** While the authors followed the HPO setup from Borisov et al. (2022), more detail on the search space of hyperparameters and justification why certain ranges were chosen would add value to the paper. Why were those parameters expected to be the most important for performance?
*   **Ablation study depth:** While the paper performs ablation studies on the split function and weighting schemes, it could be improved by including ablations that quantify the contribution of different regularization techniques.
*   **Limited Feature interaction analysis:** While the instance-wise weighting addresses some aspects of interpretability, explicitly analyzing feature interactions learned by GRANDE would further highlight the method's strengths. Are certain feature combinations more strongly associated with specific trees?
*   **Limited discussion on runtime:** Despite its robustness to high-dimensional and large datasets, GRANDE still exhibits longer runtimes compared to GPU-optimized GBDT frameworks. The paper mentions this fact but lacks discussion on potential optimizations. How does GRANDEâ€™s runtime compare when XGBoost/CatBoost are executed on a GPU? The runtime numbers should be more directly compared against GPU-enabled GBDT algorithms.
*   **Missing explanation as to why some experiments have a 5 fold CV and other experiments 10 trials:** The lack of consistency across the experimental setup is odd.

**Suggestions for improvement:**

*   Provide more details on the straight-through operator implementation and its impact on training.
*   Include a more comprehensive analysis of the computational complexity of GRANDE, including memory usage and a discussion of scaling with data size and dimensionality. Provide a scaling relationship between the runtime and input features/samples
*   Elaborate on the rationale behind the chosen hyperparameter search space.
*   Include more ablation studies that analyze the impact of different regularization techniques.
*   Analyze feature interactions learned by GRANDE to further enhance its interpretability.
*   Add more specific discussions of how GRANDE performs relative to GPU-enabled versions of other algorithms.
*   Justify the inconsistency between the folds in the cross-validation/trials of the experimental section.
*   The writing could be improved by addressing minor grammatical issues and ensuring consistent terminology.

**Overall:**

GRANDE presents a promising approach for tabular data machine learning. The combination of gradient-based optimization with hard decision trees and instance-wise weighting shows significant potential. The extensive evaluation and case study support the claims of improved performance and interpretability. Addressing the weaknesses and suggestions for improvement would further strengthen the paper and make it a valuable contribution to the field. Therefore, the paper is above the acceptance threshold with minor revisions.
