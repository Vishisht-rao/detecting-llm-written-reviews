OUTPUT:
This research examines the context of neural fields, which map low-dimensional input coordinates to corresponding signals, and proposes a novel method called Coordinate-Aware Modulation (CAM) to improve their performance. The paper addresses the trade-off between MLPs (compact but spectrally biased and slow) and grid representations (fast but spatially complex) in representing various signals. The key idea is to inject spectral bias-free grid representations into the intermediate features of an MLP using scale and shift parameters derived from the grid. This modulation aims to leverage the strengths of both approaches, leading to faster learning of high-frequency components. The paper also explores the benefits of feature normalization in conjunction with CAM, a technique that has been previously unsuccessful in this field. Experiments are conducted on various tasks including image fitting/generalization, video representation/compression, and novel view synthesis (static and dynamic scenes), showcasing state-of-the-art performance.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The proposed CAM is a novel approach to combining MLPs and grid representations in neural fields. The idea of modulating intermediate features using coordinate-aware parameters extracted from grids is well-motivated and offers a fresh perspective compared to existing sequential methods.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The paper presents extensive experimental results across a wide range of tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of CAM. State-of-the-art performance is achieved in novel view synthesis, particularly for dynamic scenes and under memory constraints for static scenes. The video compression results are also compelling.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The introduction clearly outlines the problem and the proposed solution. The method section provides a detailed explanation of CAM and its application to different tasks. The figures are helpful in visualizing the approach.
*   **Insightful Analysis:** The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the contribution of different components of CAM, such as coordinate priority and feature normalization. The analysis of feature distribution and spectral bias mitigation is also insightful.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors provide a project page with supplementary material, suggesting an effort towards reproducibility.
* Plug and Play: The method is described as "plug-and-play", which enhances its usability and potential adoption.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Theoretical Justification:** While the paper provides empirical evidence for the effectiveness of CAM, it lacks a deeper theoretical justification. A more rigorous analysis of why CAM works and how it interacts with the spectral bias of MLPs would strengthen the paper.
*   **Normalization discussion could be strengthened:** While the paper suggests normalization can be beneficial with CAM, the exact mechanism of how the interaction works could be better investigated and more deeply discussed. It is briefly mentioned but would serve the paper well if expanded.
*   **Grid resolution hyperparameter sensitivity:** The paper doesn't discuss the sensitivity to resolution choice for the grid representations. There could potentially be significant impact on performance.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Provide more theoretical analysis:** Include a more detailed theoretical discussion of why CAM helps mitigate spectral bias and how it interacts with the MLP.
*   **Quantify memory and speed trade-offs:** Provide a more comprehensive analysis of the trade-offs between memory usage, training time, and performance for different grid resolutions.
*   **Discuss limitations:** Explicitly discuss the limitations of CAM, such as potential failure cases or scenarios where it might not be effective.
*   **Address hyperparameter sensitivity:** Investigate and discuss the sensitivity of CAM to hyperparameter settings, such as learning rates, grid resolutions, and normalization parameters.
* Expand the section on Normalization, particularly explaining the hypothesis.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a well-executed and promising approach to improve neural fields. The proposed CAM is a novel and effective technique, supported by strong empirical results and insightful analysis. While the paper could benefit from a deeper theoretical analysis and further investigation of certain aspects, it represents a significant contribution to the field and is worthy of acceptance at ICLR. It should be noted that the weaknesses are not considered fatal and the work is, in general, of a high quality.
