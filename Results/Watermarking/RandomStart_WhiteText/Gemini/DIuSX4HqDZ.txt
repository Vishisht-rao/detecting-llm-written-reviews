OUTPUT:
This article addresses the key problem of abductive logical reasoning over knowledge graphs (KGs), a task that is underexplored in KG literature. The paper formally defines the task, identifies the limitations of traditional symbolic methods due to KG incompleteness and hypothesis complexity, and proposes a generative approach to address these issues. The core contribution is the Reinforcement Learning from the Knowledge Graph (RLF-KG) method, which leverages KG feedback to minimize the discrepancy between generated hypotheses' conclusions and observed entity sets. Experimental results on three widely used KGs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Problem Formulation:** The paper introduces a novel and valuable task: abductive logical reasoning over KGs. The formal definition of the problem provides a solid foundation for future research.
*   **Clear Problem Identification:** The paper clearly articulates the challenges associated with applying traditional symbolic methods to this task, particularly concerning KG incompleteness and the complexity of logical hypotheses.
*   **Technically Sound Approach:** The proposed generative approach, combined with RLF-KG, is a reasonable and well-motivated solution. The use of transformer-based generative models and PPO for reinforcement learning is appropriate.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The experimental evaluation is thorough and uses standard KG datasets (FB15k-237, WN18RR, DBpedia50). The comparison against a search-based baseline demonstrates the advantages of the proposed method.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the authors' line of reasoning. The inclusion of figures and algorithms helps to clarify the technical details.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Comparison to Existing Work:** While the paper mentions related tasks like knowledge graph completion and complex query answering, it could benefit from a more in-depth comparison with existing approaches in these areas. Specifically, it would be useful to understand how the proposed method relates to techniques for handling KG incompleteness and logical reasoning. What adaptations would be required to adapt existing query answering models for abduction?
*   **Scalability Concerns:** While the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach on relatively small KGs, the scalability of the generative model and RLF-KG to larger and more complex KGs could be a concern. The paper should acknowledge this limitation and discuss potential solutions for improving scalability. Can the reward function be made more efficient to compute?
*   **Hypothesis Space Restriction:** The paper relies on a set of 13 pre-defined logical patterns. This restricts the hypothesis space and might limit the applicability of the approach to more complex scenarios. The authors should discuss the limitations of this restriction and potential methods for expanding the hypothesis space, perhaps through learned templates or graph neural networks.
*   **Reward Shaping Details:** While the reward function incorporates the Jaccard index and KL divergence, the justification for the specific choice of parameters (e.g., the weighting of the KL divergence term, Î²) could be strengthened. A sensitivity analysis of these parameters would also be valuable.
*   **Search Based Baselines:** While a brute-force 1-hop search is presented, is this the correct comparison? Could the runtime be improved, even if it's still slower?
*   **Ambiguity in Task Definition:** In certain real-world applications, multiple valid explanations might exist for a single observation. How does the proposed approach handle this ambiguity, and how does it choose the "most likely" hypothesis? The notion of "most likely" could be further elaborated.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand Related Work:** Provide a more detailed comparison to existing approaches for handling KG incompleteness, logical reasoning, and query answering.
*   **Discuss Scalability:** Acknowledge the limitations regarding scalability and discuss potential future directions for addressing this issue.
*   **Address Hypothesis Space Restriction:** Discuss the limitations of the pre-defined logical patterns and suggest methods for expanding the hypothesis space.
*   **Justify Reward Shaping:** Provide a stronger justification for the choice of parameters in the reward function and include a sensitivity analysis.
*   **Clarify "Most Likely" Hypothesis:** Elaborate on the criteria for choosing the "most likely" hypothesis when multiple valid explanations exist.
*   **Clarify Tokenization Details:** Make the tokenization processes (and detokenization processes) more clear, including examples and diagrams.

**Overall Score:**

I am leaning towards accepting this paper, with the caveat that the authors address the weaknesses outlined above. The problem is novel and important, the approach is technically sound, and the experimental results are promising. Addressing the limitations and suggestions for improvement would significantly strengthen the paper.
