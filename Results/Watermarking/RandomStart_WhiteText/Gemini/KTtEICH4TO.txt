OUTPUT:
The study focuses on the key problem of nonprehensile manipulation of unseen objects, a challenging task with significant real-world applications. The paper introduces CORN, a novel contact-based object representation, and a pretraining pipeline designed to improve the efficiency and generalizability of reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for this task. The core idea is to pretrain a point cloud encoder to predict contact locations between the robot end-effector and the object, hypothesizing that this contact information is crucial for successful nonprehensile manipulation. This is coupled with an efficient patch-based transformer architecture for encoding point clouds, allowing for massively parallel training in simulation. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of CORN through simulated experiments and zero-shot transfer to real-world objects.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Relevance:** The paper addresses a relevant and important problem in robotics. Nonprehensile manipulation extends robot capabilities beyond simple pick-and-place tasks, allowing them to interact with a broader range of objects and environments.
*   **Novelty:** The contact-based object representation is a novel and insightful approach. Focusing on contact points rather than full shape reconstruction simplifies the learning task and improves efficiency. The patch-based transformer architecture is a well-motivated choice for scaling to parallel simulations.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The described methodology, including the pretraining task, network architecture, and RL training pipeline, appears technically sound. The data generation process for CORN is clearly defined.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The paper presents strong empirical evidence supporting its claims. The comparative experiments with various baselines demonstrate the benefits of CORN in terms of data efficiency and training time. The zero-shot transfer results to real-world objects are particularly impressive.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and clearly explains the proposed approach and experimental setup. The figures effectively illustrate the concepts and results.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors provide detailed information about their real-world setup, data generation, pretraining, architecture, domain randomization, and policy training. They also release their code, which contributes to reproducibility.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Real-World Analysis:** While the zero-shot transfer is a strong point, a more detailed analysis of the failure cases in the real world would be beneficial. The authors briefly mention challenges with concave and unstable objects, but further investigation into the causes of these failures could lead to improvements in the system. Specifically, more information on how the student policy trained with DAgger performs as compared to the teacher policy in the real world would give more context.
*   **Action Space Limitations:** The paper uses the same action space as Kim et al. (2023). While this allows for direct comparison, a discussion of the limitations of this action space and potential alternatives would be valuable. For example, does it perfectly translate to all of the objects tested?
*   **Lack of ablations:** While different pretraining methods were attempted, not enough ablations were performed on the design choices within CORN. For example, what performance is possible with a different number of patches, hidden dimensions, or transformer layers?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Deeper Real-World Failure Analysis:** Conduct a more in-depth analysis of the failure cases in the real world, including identifying the specific challenges posed by concave and unstable objects. Provide some qualitative examples of such failures. Discuss the performance delta between teacher and student policies after distillation to better demonstrate the effects of domain adaptation.
*   **Discuss Action Space Limitations:** Add a discussion of the limitations of the chosen action space and potential alternative action parameterizations for nonprehensile manipulation.
*   **Expand the Related Work:** Include a more comprehensive discussion of related work on object representation learning and manipulation planning, potentially including more recent publications in the field.
*   **Ablation Studies:** Consider performing more ablation studies to analyze the impact of different components of the CORN framework, such as the patch size, number of transformer layers, or the specific form of the contact prediction header.
*   **Improve Figure Clarity:** Consider adding more detail to Figure 4, explicitly showing the student module and how the different modules interface.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach to nonprehensile manipulation. The CORN framework demonstrates significant improvements in data efficiency and generalization compared to existing methods. The zero-shot transfer results to real-world objects are particularly compelling. With some minor improvements, this paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of robotics. I vote for acceptance.
