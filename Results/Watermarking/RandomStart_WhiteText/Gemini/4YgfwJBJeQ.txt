OUTPUT:
The study explores the key problem of visual chart understanding, aiming to bridge the gap between chart perception (extracting information) and chart reasoning (understanding the extracted data). The authors propose StructChart, a unified and label-efficient learning paradigm, which introduces Structured Triplet Representations (STR) to represent chart data and a Structuring Chart-oriented Representation Metric (SCRM) to evaluate chart perception performance. They also explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for data augmentation, generating diverse charts for training. The paper presents extensive experiments on various chart-related tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and potential of the proposed approach.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Representation:** The proposed STR format is a significant contribution. It addresses the limitations of linearized CSV tokens (LCT) by capturing the relational structure within charts, which is essential for reasoning.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation Metric:** The SCRM provides a more structured and tunable metric for evaluating chart perception, taking into account data relations. This addresses a key weakness in existing evaluation methods.
*   **Label-Efficient Learning:** The use of LLMs for data augmentation is a clever approach to address the challenge of expensive chart data acquisition and annotation. The SimChart9K dataset is a valuable resource.
*   **Strong Experimental Results:** The experiments demonstrate that StructChart achieves strong performance on various chart-related tasks, including perception, question answering, summarization, and redrawing. The ablation studies and comparisons with existing methods provide compelling evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the proposed approach and experimental results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Reasoning Module Simplicity:** The paper uses GPT-3.5 *without* prompt engineering for the reasoning stage. While this maintains a fair comparison, it might not fully demonstrate the potential of STR for complex reasoning tasks. Exploring more advanced prompting strategies or a fine-tuned reasoning module could further improve the results.
*   **Limited Quantitative Results on Summarization/Redrawing:**  The lack of quantitative results on summarization and redrawing tasks, relying instead on qualitative examples, weakens the evaluation of the full chart understanding pipeline. While the visualizations are helpful, objective metrics would strengthen the claims.
*   **Dataset Bias:** While SimChart9K boosts performance, relying heavily on synthetic data raises questions about the generalizability of the model to more complex or unusual real-world charts not well represented in the initial ChartQA dataset used for simulation. A study on more diverse real-world datasets would be beneficial.
*  **Clarity on LLM Prompting Details:** More specifics on the exact few-shot prompts used for both data simulation and drawing code generation would improve reproducibility. Appendix E provides some details but could be expanded.
*  **Ablation of Different STR components:** It would be helpful to ablate different aspects of the STR to understand which contribute most to the performance gain (e.g., just using triplets with entities, without the designed structure).

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Explore advanced prompting strategies or fine-tune a more sophisticated reasoning module.** This could better showcase the potential of the STR format for complex reasoning tasks.
*   **Develop objective metrics for evaluating summarization and redrawing tasks.** This would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the chart understanding pipeline.
*   **Evaluate the model on more diverse real-world chart datasets.** This would help to assess the generalizability of the model to different types of charts and domains.
*   **Provide more details about the LLM prompting strategies used for data augmentation and drawing code generation.**
*  **Include an ablation study of different STR components.**

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach for visual chart understanding. The proposed STR format, SCRM evaluation metric, and LLM-based data augmentation technique are all significant contributions. While there are some areas for improvement, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field and is worthy of acceptance.
