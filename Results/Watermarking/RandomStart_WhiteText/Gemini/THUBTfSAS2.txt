OUTPUT:
The paper focuses on the key issue of active learning, specifically addressing the challenge of selecting the most informative unlabeled data points to improve model performance. It introduces the "least disagree metric" (LDM) as a novel measure of a sample's closeness to the decision boundary, arguing that samples with the smallest LDM are the most uncertain and therefore the most valuable for querying. The paper provides an asymptotically consistent estimator for LDM using parameter perturbation, presents an LDM-based active learning algorithm (LDM-S) incorporating diversity, and demonstrates its state-of-the-art performance across various datasets and deep architectures.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The LDM is a fresh perspective on measuring uncertainty compared to traditional methods like entropy or margin-based approaches. The idea of quantifying closeness based on the "smallest probability of disagreement" is intuitively appealing.
*   **Theoretical Justification:** The paper provides theoretical backing for the LDM, including an asymptotically consistent estimator under mild assumptions and a proof of concept within the linear classifier.
*   **Practical Algorithm:** The parameter perturbation-based algorithm for empirically evaluating LDM is computationally efficient and easy to implement for deep learning models.
*   **State-of-the-Art Performance:** The experimental results across a wide range of datasets and architectures are compelling, demonstrating that LDM-S consistently achieves superior or comparable performance to existing active learning algorithms. The detailed experimental setup and thorough comparisons are commendable.
*   **Diversity Consideration:** The inclusion of k-means++ seeding to promote batch diversity is a crucial addition, addressing the common issue of sampling bias in uncertainty-based active learning. The modified exponential decaying weighting scheme effectively balances LDM and diversity.
*   **Ablation Study:**  The ablation study provides insights into the contribution of individual components such as the stop condition and seeding.
*   **Well-written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-structured and clearly written, making it relatively easy to follow the proposed approach and its theoretical and empirical justifications.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Assumption 3 (Coverage Assumption):** This assumption, while necessary for the theoretical consistency of the LDM estimator, feels somewhat abstract and difficult to verify in practice, especially for complex deep learning models. It would be beneficial to provide more guidance on how to ensure this assumption holds in different scenarios or explore alternative theoretical frameworks that rely on weaker assumptions. While an explanation in the appendix is provided it does not help.
*   **Limited Theoretical Scope:** The theoretical analysis is primarily focused on two-dimensional binary classification with linear separators. While this provides a foundational understanding, it would be valuable to explore potential extensions to more complex scenarios, such as multiclass classification or non-linear decision boundaries, or include justification why this limitation does not undermine the performance of the algorithm on more complex datasets.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** While the ablation study addresses the hyperparameters in the LDM-S, there could be more analysis about their robustness and tuning. The variances {Ïƒ<sup>2</sup><sub>k</sub>}<sup>K</sup><sub>k=1</sub>'s selection is explained, but it would be interesting to discuss how robust the performance is to different variance schedules.
*   **Clarity on choice of \$\\beta\$ in LDM-S:** It is unclear whether \$\\beta\$ is considered a hyperparameter and what considerations should be used for the selection of that value, or even what the effect on performance would be if that number were changed.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Strengthen the Justification for Assumption 3:** Provide more practical guidance on how to verify or satisfy the coverage assumption in real-world scenarios, or explore alternative theoretical frameworks that rely on weaker assumptions.
*   **Discuss Limitations and Future Directions:** Acknowledge the limitations of the theoretical analysis and discuss potential avenues for extending the theory to more complex settings. For example, discuss how LDM might be adapted for different network architectures or loss functions.
*   **Further Exploration of Hyperparameter Tuning:** Include more discussion of tuning the algorithm's hyperparameters and analyze their robustness.
*   **Expand on related work:** The related work mentions the key algorithms that are out-performed by LDM-S, however more can be included about their downsides or why it makes sense they would be less performant given LDM's novel method of selection.
*   **Clarity on the Role of diversity**: While diversity considerations are addressed, further insights on why diversity is necessary in LDM-S and whether it is more or less important than LDM itself would be helpful.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that introduces a novel and effective approach to active learning. The LDM is a promising new uncertainty measure, and the LDM-S algorithm demonstrates impressive performance across a variety of datasets. The paper's theoretical grounding, practical implementation, and comprehensive experimental evaluation make it a significant contribution to the field. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above could further enhance the paper's impact and broaden its applicability.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend acceptance of this paper. The strengths outweigh the weaknesses, and the potential for future research based on the LDM is significant.
