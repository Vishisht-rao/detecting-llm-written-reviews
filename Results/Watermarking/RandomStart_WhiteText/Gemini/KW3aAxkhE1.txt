OUTPUT:
The article investigates a critical aspect of multi-modal instruction following by introducing TEXTBIND, a novel, almost annotation-free framework for generating multi-turn interleaved multimodal instruction-response conversations. The paper addresses a significant challenge in the field: the scarcity of high-quality, diverse exemplar data for training large language models (LLMs) with multimodal capabilities, particularly in open-world scenarios. The proposed TEXTBIND framework leverages readily available image-caption pairs and a language model (specifically GPT-4) to generate these conversations, then introduces MIM, a LM centric architecture to support the interleaved data. The paper presents compelling quantitative and qualitative results demonstrating the effectiveness of MIM trained on TEXTBIND in generating realistic and coherent multi-modal conversations, outperforming existing baselines.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The TEXTBIND framework is a novel and significant contribution, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution to generate training data for multi-modal instruction following. The problem being addressed is very relevant.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The methodology is well-defined and technically sound, encompassing topic-aware image sampling, LLM-powered conversation generation, human-in-the-loop refinement, and post-processing steps. The integration of image encoders, decoders, and LMs in the MIM architecture is thoughtfully designed.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper presents a thorough evaluation, including quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines on TEXTBINDEVAL, a newly constructed evaluation dataset, and qualitative demonstrations showcasing the capabilities of MIM.  The ablation studies and fine-grained human evaluations provide further insights into the model's performance. The additional eval on existing benchmarks and the justification for why the model doesn't perform as well in those contexts is valuable.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written, well-organized, and easy to follow. The introduction clearly motivates the research, and the related work section provides a good overview of the existing literature. The appendices provide additional details about the implementation and evaluation.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors state that the dataset will be released, and provide many implementation details.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Reliance on GPT-4:** TEXTBIND's dependence on GPT-4 is a limitation, as access to GPT-4 and its associated costs might restrict the reproducibility and scalability of the framework for some researchers. While GPT-4 is a strong LLM, a discussion of the sensitivity of TEXTBIND to the quality of the underlying LLM is warranted.
*   **Hallucinations/Mismatches:** While the authors address the issue of hallucinations and image-caption mismatches, the error rates are still present, even after filtering. A more detailed analysis of the types of errors and potential mitigation strategies could be beneficial. Further analysis in the appendix showed very low % in incoherence/hallucination cases.
*   **TEXTBINDEVAL Details:** While the authors mention that TEXTBINDEVAL is initially generated through the TEXTBIND pipeline and then refined by human annotators, more specifics about the refinement procedure and the criteria used for quality assessment could be included in the main text.
*   **Evaluation metrics**: It's unclear if the automatic evaluation metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore) are truly indicative of the quality of the generated conversational responses. Human evaluations, while subjective, might provide a more reliable assessment. Additional details about the human evaluation process (number of annotators, annotation guidelines) should be included. In the paper it provides details about the number of annotators, annotation guidelines, and Krippendorff’s α value.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address the limitations of relying on GPT-4:**  Discuss the potential impact of using different LLMs on the performance of TEXTBIND.  Explore alternative approaches for generating conversations that might be less reliant on proprietary models.
*   **Discuss error mitigation:** Expand on potential strategies to further reduce the incidence of hallucinations and image-caption mismatches. Could techniques like consistency checking or knowledge graph integration be employed?
*   **Provide more details about TEXTBINDEVAL construction:**  Offer a more detailed account of the human annotation process used for constructing TEXTBINDEVAL.  Include examples of the types of issues that were corrected and the criteria used for judging the quality of the data.
*   **Expand on Evaluation Metrics:** Even though the paper evaluates textual response generation and image generation separately, it should explain how these can be integrated for comprehensive analysis.
*   **Broader Impact:** Consider adding a brief section discussing the broader impact of this work, including potential ethical considerations and societal implications.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a valuable contribution to the field of multi-modal instruction following. The TEXTBIND framework is a promising approach for generating training data, and the MIM architecture demonstrates the potential of LLMs for multi-modal conversations. While the paper has some limitations, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. I am leaning towards acceptance.
