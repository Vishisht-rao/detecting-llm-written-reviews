OUTPUT:
This study examines a critical area in explainable AI: generating feasible and actionable algorithmic recourse for black-box machine learning models. The paper addresses the limitations of existing recourse methods that often produce unrealistic or infeasible recommendations by failing to account for underlying causal relationships among input features. The core idea is novel and promising: modeling algorithmic recourse as a manipulation of exogenous noise within a structural causal model (SCM), rather than directly perturbing input features. The authors propose two instantiations of this idea, AR-L2 and AR-Nuc, which leverage non-linear Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to identify and constrain the variation of exogenous noise, effectively preserving causal relationships without requiring explicit knowledge of the SCM or causal graph.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The approach of connecting algorithmic recourse to exogenous noise manipulation within an SCM framework is a significant contribution. It offers a potential solution to a major challenge in the field.
*   **Theoretical Justification:** The paper provides theoretical justifications for its approach, including theorems that relate the identification of exogenous noise to the learned representations of an exogenous regressor and connect the sparsity and magnitude constraints on exogenous representations to the corresponding properties of the exogenous noise variation.
*   **Practical Methods:** The authors present two concrete methods, AR-L2 and AR-Nuc, that are relatively easy to implement and can be integrated with existing recourse frameworks like CFVAE.
*   **Empirical Evaluation:** The experimental results on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The experiments show improvements in feasibility and distribution scores compared to baseline methods, while maintaining validity and proximity.
*   **Comprehensive Baselines:** The comparison against several baselines, including vanilla recourse methods, partial oracle methods (with prior causal graph), and oracle methods (with full SCM), helps to contextualize the performance of the proposed approach.
*   **Good writing clarity and organization:** Although this is an anonymous version, the manuscript is relatively well-written, with a clear flow of logic.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Causal Sufficiency Assumption:** The paper relies on the strong assumption of causal sufficiency, which is often violated in real-world scenarios. This limits the applicability of the proposed methods to settings where all relevant confounders are observed. The authors acknowledge this limitation in the discussion, but it should be emphasized more prominently.
*   **Choice of Hyperparameters:** The paper mentions that the margin β, and the hyperparameters αn and αm for controlling AR-Nuc and AR- L2, are set to 0.2, 2, and 2 respectively. But, the criteria in choosing these hyperparameters are missing. Also, the stability analysis shows the impact of the hyperparameters, and this can be further studied.
*   **Limited Analysis of High-Dimensional Data:** While the paper includes experiments on a synthetic dataset with 80 features, the analysis is relatively limited. A more in-depth investigation of the scalability and performance of the proposed methods in high-dimensional settings would be valuable. The time complexity results are useful, but further details regarding memory constraints and the specific hardware used for experiments are missing.
*   **Presentation of experimental results:** While the paper compares with state-of-the-art methods, a table summarizing the distribution score for all methods in different conditions is missing.
*   **Clarity Regarding the Regression System:** The role and design of the regression system could be better motivated and explained. The theorem supporting its validity relies on technical assumptions that might be opaque to some readers.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address the Causal Sufficiency Assumption:** Discuss potential approaches to relax the causal sufficiency assumption, such as incorporating auxiliary information (instrumental variables or proxy variables).
*   **Provide More Details on the Regression System:** Offer a more intuitive explanation of the role and design of the regression system. Elaborate on the motivation behind using an auxiliary variable and how it aids in identifying exogenous noise.
*   **Expand the Analysis of High-Dimensional Data:** Conduct a more comprehensive analysis of the scalability and performance of the proposed methods in high-dimensional settings. Consider using real-world high-dimensional datasets if feasible. Discuss the computational complexity in detail.
*   **Discuss the limitations of ICA for real-world recourse applications**: ICA itself has limitations, particularly with highly complex or non-stationary data. Discussing these limitations, and potential ways to address them within the context of algorithmic recourse, would further strengthen the paper.
*   **Add a table summarizing the distribution score of all methods.**

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that addresses a significant problem in algorithmic recourse. The proposed approach is novel, theoretically justified, and empirically validated. While the paper has some limitations, the contributions are substantial and warrant publication. Addressing the suggestions above would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact.
