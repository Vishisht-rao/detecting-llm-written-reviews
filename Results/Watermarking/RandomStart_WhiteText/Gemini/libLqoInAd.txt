OUTPUT:
The manuscript focuses on an important aspect of machine learning - reliable uncertainty quantification for safety-critical applications. It proposes a novel approach combining the Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence (DST) with conformal prediction (CP) to obtain set predictions with guaranteed confidence. The paper argues that this approach better captures both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty compared to calibrated softmax classifiers, particularly in scenarios with high epistemic uncertainty. The paper also proposes a reduced complexity method to address the exponential scaling inherent to DST-based classifiers.

Here's a breakdown of the review:

**Strengths:**

*   **Relevance and Importance:** The paper addresses a crucial challenge in deploying ML models in safety-critical domains. Reliable uncertainty quantification is essential for risk-sensitive decision-making.
*   **Novelty:** The combination of DST and CP for this purpose is a novel approach.  The application of DST is gaining traction, and this work contributes to its exploration in the context of uncertainty quantification.
*   **Clarity (Generally):** The paper does a decent job of explaining the core concepts of DST and CP, especially given that DST is not a widely familiar topic.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The paper provides empirical evidence on several datasets (EMNIST, GTSRB, CIFAR10) demonstrating the superiority of the proposed methods over a standard softmax classifier with temperature scaling.
*   **Addressing Scalability:** The introduction of the "n-dimensional" DS Classifier to address the exponential scaling problem is a significant contribution, broadening the applicability of the DST-based approach.
*   **Reproducibility (Partial):** The authors mention that code is available upon request and include dataset and training details in the appendix, enhancing the potential for reproducibility.
*   **Connections to Related Work:**  The paper discusses related work, particularly the challenges with calibrating softmax outputs. It effectively positions its contribution within the existing literature.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity (Specific Areas):** The loss functions (equations 8 and 9) could benefit from a more intuitive explanation of *why* they are designed in this way. While the paper mentions the trade-off between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, the direct connection to the MSE and cross-entropy terms needs strengthening.  The choice to zero-out negative values in one MSE term but not the other requires a more compelling justification.
*   **Justification of Hyperparameter Choice:** The paper states that performance is not highly sensitive to λ. While convenient, this needs more rigorous support. Even if performance isn't *highly* sensitive, there's likely an optimal range.  A small ablation study varying λ would significantly strengthen this claim. A discussion of strategies for setting this hyperparameter in new tasks without extensive search will also be beneficial.
*   **Theoretical Underpinnings:** While the paper mentions recent theoretical results related to epistemic uncertainty (Bengs et al., 2022, 2023), it could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of how the proposed DST-based approach aligns with these theoretical findings. Specifically, is the observed improvement solely due to better calibration, or is there a deeper theoretical reason why DST is inherently better at capturing epistemic uncertainty in this context?
*   **Comparisons:** More comparisons and discussion against other uncertainty quantification methods will greatly improve the paper. For example, how does the performance compare with a Deep Ensemble model given similar computational resources?
*   **Limited Scope of Datasets:** While the datasets used are common, they are relatively simple.  It would be beneficial to evaluate the proposed methods on more complex and high-dimensional datasets to assess their scalability and effectiveness in more realistic scenarios.
*   **Trade-offs:** The paper does not fully explore any potential trade-offs associated with the approach. The results showed improvements in the average prediction set size and calibration for some datasets. Is there any performance hit on the accuracy compared with other UQ models.
*   **Justification of Assumptions:** The paper's loss function implicitly assumes the capacity to discern the extent of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty during training, yet the strategy to validate this assumption is not described.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Loss Function Explanation:** Provide a more detailed and intuitive explanation of the loss functions (equations 8 and 9). Connect the terms directly to the goal of capturing aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.
*   **Hyperparameter Ablation:** Include a small ablation study to demonstrate the sensitivity of the results to the λ hyperparameter. Provide guidance on how to choose this parameter in practice.
*   **Theoretical Discussion:** Expand the discussion of the theoretical underpinnings of the approach, linking it more closely to the recent theoretical results on epistemic uncertainty.
*   **Broader Evaluation:** Evaluate the proposed methods on more complex and high-dimensional datasets.
*   **Computational Cost Analysis:** While the paper emphasizes computational efficiency, a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed methods compared to other uncertainty quantification techniques would be valuable.
*   **Address Trade-offs:** Explore and discuss any potential trade-offs associated with the approach (e.g., accuracy vs. set size, computational cost vs. uncertainty quantification performance).
*   **Discussion of Limitations:** A section discussing the limitations of the proposed approach would increase the paper's credibility. This could include limitations related to scalability, applicability to different types of data, or sensitivity to hyperparameter settings.
*   **Explicitly address the limitations of this method in high dimensional credal set.**

**Overall Recommendation:**

The paper presents a promising approach to reliable uncertainty quantification using DST and CP. The novelty, empirical validation, and attempt to address scalability are strong points. However, the weaknesses related to clarity, justification of hyperparameter choices, theoretical underpinnings, limited scope of datasets, and discussion of limitations need to be addressed.

Therefore, I recommend **revision**. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would significantly strengthen the paper and make it a more valuable contribution to the field.
