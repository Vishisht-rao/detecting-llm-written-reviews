OUTPUT:
This paper investigates an important problem: ensuring faithfulness and verifiability in LLM-generated text, particularly in information-seeking scenarios. The authors focus on improving attribution by exploring plan-based models, conceptualizing plans as sequences of questions that serve as blueprints for content generation. They compare abstractive and extractive blueprint models against a standard sequence-to-sequence baseline on the AQuAMuSe dataset and also test the generalizability on the ALCE benchmark.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses a Critical Issue:** The paper tackles a crucial challenge in the deployment of LLMs: the lack of transparency and potential for factual inaccuracies. The focus on attribution and verifiable information is highly relevant and timely.
*   **Well-Defined Research Questions:** The paper clearly articulates three important research questions related to the impact of attribution, the importance of the attribution mechanism (plan-based vs. standard), and the robustness of attribution skills across tasks.
*   **Novel Approach:** The use of plan-based models with question blueprints is a promising approach to improving the faithfulness, grounding, and controllability of generated text. The distinction between abstractive and extractive blueprints offers valuable insights into different planning strategies.
*   **Thorough Experimental Evaluation:** The experiments are well-designed and conducted on a relevant dataset (AQuAMuSe). The inclusion of zero-shot transfer experiments on the ALCE benchmark strengthens the evaluation and assesses the generalizability of the approach.
*   **Comprehensive Analysis:** The paper presents a detailed analysis of the results, including comparisons across models, examination of abstractiveness, and exploration of different citation formats. The discussion of grounding and controllability is particularly insightful.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the research questions, methods, and results. The figures and tables effectively illustrate the concepts and findings.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Novelty in Blueprint Generation:** While the application of blueprints to the citation problem is novel, the blueprint generation methods themselves rely on existing techniques (question generation from QA datasets). The paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the challenges and potential improvements in this area.
*   **Computational Efficiency of Extractive Model:** The paper acknowledges the computational inefficiency of the extractive model, but this could be emphasized further. Generating questions for every input passage is likely to be a bottleneck in real-world applications. A discussion of strategies to mitigate this issue would be valuable.
*   **Automatic Citation Annotation:** The paper relies on automatic annotation of target summaries with citations using entailment. While this is a common approach, it is prone to errors. A more detailed discussion of the limitations of this approach and its potential impact on the results would be beneficial.
*   **Comparison to State-of-the-Art:** The paper states improvements over Narayan et al. (2023) as the state of the art on AQuAMuSe. However, the authors also admit the approaches aren't directly comparable. A clearer discussion of how the results compare to the broader state-of-the-art in long-form question answering and query-focused summarization (beyond specifically blueprint models) would be valuable.
*   **Small Zero-Shot Improvement:** The ALCE benchmark results show only modest improvements in attribution compared to LLM baselines, and correctness lags significantly. This casts some doubt on the practical utility of the proposed blueprint method in out-of-domain scenarios, particularly given the added complexity. The authors should more critically examine these findings and perhaps explore ways to boost transfer performance.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Elaborate on Blueprint Generation:** Provide more details on the specific challenges encountered in generating blueprints and potential solutions. Consider exploring alternative blueprint representations or generation methods.
*   **Address Computational Efficiency:** Discuss strategies to improve the computational efficiency of the extractive model, such as filtering passages before question generation or using more efficient question generation models.
*   **Qualitative Analysis of Citations:** Include a qualitative analysis of the generated citations to better understand their accuracy and relevance. Identify common errors and discuss potential solutions.
*   **More Rigorous Benchmarking:** Compare against additional state-of-the-art models for long-form QA and summarization on AQuAMuSe, even if these models don't directly use blueprints. This would give a clearer sense of the overall performance improvements.
*   **Analyze ALCE Results:** Deep-dive on reasons for weaker ALCE results. Perhaps the blueprints are not well-aligned to the target datasets' question/answer styles? Could the question generation models be further fine-tuned on relevant out-of-domain data?
*   **Discuss Limitations:** Explicitly discuss the limitations of the automatic citation annotation and its potential impact on the results. A sensitivity analysis could be performed to assess the robustness of the findings to errors in citation annotation.

**Overall Recommendation:**

This is a strong paper that addresses an important problem with a novel and well-executed approach. The experimental results are promising and provide valuable insights into the benefits of plan-based models for generating text with citations. While there are some weaknesses, the paper is a valuable contribution to the field and is worthy of acceptance. The suggested improvements would further strengthen the paper and enhance its impact. I recommend acceptance, conditional upon addressing the points raised in this review.
