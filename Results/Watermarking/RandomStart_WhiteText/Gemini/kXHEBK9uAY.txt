OUTPUT:
This article explores an important aspect of offline reinforcement learning: improving diffusion-based planning through hierarchical structures. The paper introduces a novel method called Hierarchical Diffuser (HD), which combines the strengths of hierarchical reinforcement learning and diffusion probabilistic models for enhanced long-horizon planning, offline RL performance, and generalization capabilities.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Problem Definition and Motivation:** The paper clearly identifies the limitations of existing diffusion-based planning methods, specifically their computational cost, sampling inefficiency, and inadequate coverage of the data distribution. The motivation for exploring hierarchical planning within the diffusion framework is well-articulated.
*   **Novelty of Approach:** The Hierarchical Diffuser framework presents a simple, yet effective approach to address these limitations. The idea of using a "jumpy" high-level planner and a low-level subgoal achiever is intuitive and potentially impactful.
*   **Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation:** The paper presents a thorough empirical evaluation across various benchmark tasks, including Maze2D, AntMaze, Gym-MuJoCo, and FrankaKitchen. The results consistently demonstrate the superior performance of HD compared to existing methods, including the non-hierarchical Diffuser and other hierarchical planning algorithms.
*   **Insightful Analysis:** The analysis section provides valuable insights into the factors influencing the performance of diffusion-based planners. The exploration of the receptive field and its impact on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization is particularly noteworthy. The compositional out-of-distribution (OOD) task is well-designed and reveals the limitations of simply increasing the kernel size of Diffuser.
*   **Theoretical Analysis:** The paper provides a theoretical analysis that sheds light on the generalization properties of the proposed method and the trade-offs associated with the parameter K and kernel size. This helps ground the empirical findings in a more rigorous framework.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the proposed method and understand the experimental results.
* **Reproducibility:** The authors provide implementation and hyper-parameter details in the appendix, enhancing the reproducibility of the work.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Simplicity of Subgoal Selection:** The paper uses a simple fixed-interval subgoal selection strategy. While the results demonstrate its effectiveness, exploring more sophisticated subgoal selection methods could further improve performance. A better comparison to other subgoal extraction strategies may enhance the work.
*   **Dataset Dependency:** The paper acknowledges the method's dependency on the quality of the dataset. While this is a common limitation of offline RL methods, it would be beneficial to discuss potential strategies for mitigating this issue, such as dataset augmentation techniques.
*   **Value Function Accuracy:** The discussion of value function accuracy limitations and the trade-off with jump steps is not fully explored. The paper needs more exploration of how to overcome these trade-offs or mitigate negative impacts.
*   **Limited Exploration of Visual Domain:** The conclusion mentions expanding the methodology to the visual domain as a future direction, but there is no preliminary discussion or exploration of the challenges and opportunities associated with this extension.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Subgoal Selection Exploration:** Investigating and comparing different subgoal selection strategies (e.g., adaptive selection based on environmental features or learned skills) could potentially enhance the performance and robustness of the HD framework.
*   **Addressing Dataset Limitations:** Discuss potential techniques for mitigating the dependency on dataset quality, such as dataset augmentation or transfer learning from related datasets.
*   **Value Function Tradeoff Discussion:** Elaborate on strategies for improving value function accuracy in the context of "jumpy" planning, such as using more sophisticated value function approximators or incorporating auxiliary losses.
*   **Visual Domain Discussion:** Provide a preliminary discussion of the challenges and opportunities associated with extending the HD framework to the visual domain, such as dealing with high-dimensional image inputs and learning visual representations.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of offline reinforcement learning. The Hierarchical Diffuser framework offers a promising approach to improve diffusion-based planning by leveraging hierarchical structures. The comprehensive experimental evaluation, insightful analysis, and theoretical analysis provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed method. While there are some limitations and areas for improvement, this paper is a valuable addition to the literature and is likely to stimulate further research in this area. The work is of high quality and suitable for publication at ICLR.
