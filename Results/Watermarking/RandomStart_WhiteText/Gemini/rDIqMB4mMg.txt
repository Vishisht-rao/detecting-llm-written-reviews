OUTPUT:
This manuscript explores a critical issue: improving precipitation forecasting accuracy, particularly for heavy rainfall events, which are often poorly predicted by existing methods. The paper introduces PostRainBench, a new comprehensive benchmark for NWP post-processing, and proposes CAMT, a novel channel attention-enhanced multi-task learning framework. The authors demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods and traditional NWP approaches on three distinct datasets. The work is well-motivated, clearly presented, and provides a valuable contribution to the field.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The paper addresses a critical problem with significant societal impact. The introduction of PostRainBench fills a gap in the field by providing a standardized benchmark for evaluating NWP post-processing techniques. The CAMT model is a novel approach that effectively leverages channel attention and multi-task learning to improve forecasting accuracy.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The experimental evaluation is thorough and well-designed. The authors compare CAMT against strong baselines, including NWP and several deep learning models, across three diverse datasets. The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the contribution of each component of CAMT.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The problem is clearly defined, the proposed solution is well-explained, and the experimental results are presented in a clear and concise manner. The figures and tables are informative and contribute to the overall clarity of the paper.
*   **Significant Results:** The paper demonstrates significant improvements in forecasting accuracy, particularly for heavy rainfall events. The fact that CAMT is the first deep learning-based method to outperform traditional NWP approaches in extreme precipitation conditions is a notable achievement.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors provide sufficient implementation details and plan to release their code and datasets, which will greatly facilitate reproducibility and future research in this area.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited novelty in individual components:** While the combination of channel attention, multi-task learning, and weighted loss is novel, the individual components themselves are well-established. The paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of how these components are specifically adapted and optimized for the precipitation forecasting task.
*   **Choice of backbone:** The choice of Swin-Unet, while effective, isn't thoroughly justified in the context of weather forecasting. The paper mentions its general suitability for image segmentation, but a discussion relating its architectural properties to the specific challenges of weather data (e.g., its ability to capture long-range dependencies) would be helpful.
*   **Hyperparameter sensitivity:** The paper mentions using specific hyperparameters for different datasets. It would be beneficial to include a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the robustness of CAMT to different hyperparameter settings. The choice of alpha (weighting the MSE loss) seems particularly impactful and deserves further exploration.
*   **Computational cost:** The paper does not discuss the computational cost of CAMT compared to the baseline methods and NWP. This is an important consideration for practical applications, and it would be helpful to include a comparison of training and inference times.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Elaborate on Adaptations:** Provide a more detailed explanation of how the channel attention module, multi-task learning, and weighted loss are specifically tailored for precipitation forecasting.
*   **Justify Swin-Unet:** Provide a more thorough justification for the choice of Swin-Unet as the backbone, highlighting its advantages in the context of weather data.
*   **Hyperparameter Analysis:** Include a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the robustness of CAMT to different hyperparameter settings. Explore the impact of different alpha values.
*   **Computational Cost:** Discuss the computational cost of CAMT compared to the baseline methods and NWP, including training and inference times.
*   **Qualitative results:** Including a figure showing example predictions by the different models would help to further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed CAMT model.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of precipitation forecasting. The introduction of PostRainBench and the CAMT model will be valuable assets for future research in this area. Despite the minor weaknesses identified above, the paper is well-written, clearly presented, and demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend this paper for acceptance to ICLR 2024, pending consideration of the suggestions for improvement.
