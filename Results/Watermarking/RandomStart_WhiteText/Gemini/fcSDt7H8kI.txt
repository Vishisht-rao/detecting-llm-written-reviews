OUTPUT:
This paper addresses a critical context in deep reinforcement learning: the challenge of efficient exploration in high-dimensional, complex Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The paper proposes a novel experience collection technique called "MaxMin TD Learning" based on minimizing the state-action value function (Q-function) during exploration. The authors provide a theoretical justification for this seemingly counter-intuitive approach, arguing that in the early stages of training, when the Q-function is largely "uninformed" and "smooth," selecting actions that minimize the Q-value leads to higher temporal difference (TD) errors and thus, more informative experiences. They then demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through extensive experiments on the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), showing significant improvements in sample efficiency compared to standard ε-greedy exploration and NoisyNetworks.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The idea of using action minimization for exploration is novel and somewhat counterintuitive, making the paper stand out.
*   **Theoretical Justification:** The paper provides a solid theoretical basis for the proposed method. The definitions of "uninformed Q-function" and "smooth Q-function," along with Propositions 3.4, 3.6, and 3.7, provide a clear explanation of why minimizing the Q-value can be beneficial for exploration.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The experimental results on the ALE benchmark are convincing, demonstrating significant improvements in sample efficiency compared to existing methods. The inclusion of both the 100K benchmark and longer training runs further strengthens the empirical evaluation.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, particularly the introduction and background sections. The algorithm is clearly presented.
*   **Addressing a key issue:** Sample efficiency is a major bottleneck in deep RL, and this paper makes a valuable contribution toward addressing it.
*   **Zero additional cost:** The method boasts no additional computational cost, making it an attractive solution.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited novelty with related works:** The paper contrasts its approach against epsilon-greedy and NoisyNets, but should expand its comparison and discussion against more recent exploration strategies. Count-based exploration, intrinsic motivation techniques, and other value-function-based exploration strategies need to be explicitly addressed.
*   **Clarity of experiments:** More details of the experiments should be provided. For example, it is claimed that the architecture details are in the supplementary material, but information about the hyperparameters is vague. Which values are adopted for the learning rate and the batch size? Are these values adapted for each game?
*   **Overclaiming:** The abstract contains the statement that "our method provides theoretical basis for efﬁcient experience collection, and further comes with zero additional computational cost..." This should be weakened as there is always some cost to implementation, and the experiments are limited. It is more accurate to claim that the method is computationally efficient.
*   **Definitions of smoothness and uninformed:** The definition of smoothness may not be as smooth as intended. The expectation is taken across Q function initialisations, which may not be a useful measure. It would be better to take an expectation across different states.
*   **Writing:** The paper contains several grammatical errors.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand on related works:** Providing more details on count-based methods in the high-dimensional setting would further contextualize the contribution. Also, there has been prior work done on exploration via Q-value uncertainty. Including a discussion of this work and how it relates to the proposed method would add value.
*   **Hyperparameter sensitivity:** It would be beneficial to show how the performance of MaxMin TD Learning varies with different values of the exploration parameter (ε) or other relevant hyperparameters.
*   **Ablation Studies:** Including an ablation study to isolate the effect of the minimum-value action selection strategy would further strengthen the results. For example, one could compare MaxMin TD Learning to a variant that selects actions randomly from the bottom k% of Q-values.
*   **Generalization:** While the ALE benchmark is a good starting point, it would be valuable to evaluate MaxMin TD Learning on other environments, particularly those with continuous action spaces or more complex reward structures.
*   **Extend theoretical support:** It would be interesting to extend the theoretical analysis to consider cases where the Q-function is not perfectly "uninformed" or "smooth," as this is likely to be the case in practice.
*   **Writing/Grammar:** Proofread to remove grammatical errors.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a novel and promising approach to exploration in deep reinforcement learning. The theoretical justification and empirical results are compelling, and the simplicity of the method makes it attractive for practical applications. The weaknesses mentioned above are relatively minor and can be addressed in future revisions. I recommend this paper for acceptance, pending the authors' responses to the comments and suggestions provided above.
