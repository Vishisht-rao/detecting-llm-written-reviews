OUTPUT:
This study addresses the key area of robustness in offline reinforcement learning (RL) against state observation perturbations, a critical challenge for real-world applications. The paper proposes a novel framework called Diffusion Model-Based Predictor (DMBP) that uses conditional diffusion models to recover actual states from perturbed observations in state-based RL tasks. The core idea is to use diffusion models as noise reduction tools rather than trajectory generators, which is a refreshing perspective.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Approach:** The paper introduces a genuinely innovative approach by leveraging diffusion models for state denoising in offline RL, addressing a gap in existing literature. The idea of predicting the actual state rather than training robust policies against worst-case disturbances is compelling.
*   **Clear Problem Definition:** The paper clearly articulates the problem of state observation perturbations and its implications for offline RL. The motivating examples, such as sensor errors in autonomous vehicles and robotics, are relevant and impactful.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The DMBP framework is well-described, with a clear explanation of the conditional diffusion model and the reverse denoising process. The authors provide sufficient detail for understanding the technical aspects of the proposed approach.
*   **Non-Markovian Loss Function:** The proposed non-Markovian loss function to mitigate error accumulation is a significant contribution. The justification for this loss and its derivation are well-explained, and the ablation studies demonstrate its effectiveness.
*   **State Infilling for Incomplete Observations:** The application of DMBP for state infilling with unobserved dimensions is a valuable addition. This capability addresses a common real-world scenario where sensors might be compromised.
*   **Comprehensive Experiments:** The paper presents thorough experimental results on standard benchmark problems (D4RL Mujoco, Adroit, Franka Kitchen) with different types and scales of perturbations. The comparison against state-of-the-art baseline algorithms demonstrates the superior robustness of DMBP. The inclusion of "medium-replay" datasets is particularly relevant for real-world offline RL.
*   **Ablation Studies:** The detailed ablation studies on the non-Markovian loss function, network structure (Unet-MLP), and condition trajectory lengths provide valuable insights into the design choices of DMBP.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it relatively easy to follow the technical details and experimental results.
*   **Code Availability:** The availability of the implementation code is a significant benefit for reproducibility and further research.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** While the paper mentions hyperparameter tuning in Appendix B, more discussion on the sensitivity of DMBP to hyperparameter settings would be valuable. Specifically, how the values for a, b, and c in the variance schedule were chosen and their impact on performance. The choice of 'k' (diffusion start timestep) based on the noise level seems ad-hoc and not very practical. A more automated way of tuning 'k' is desirable.
*   **Computational Cost:** Although addressed in Appendix D.5, the computational cost of DMBP is a concern. While the authors argue that it expedites convergence overall, the increased decision time consumption might be a limiting factor for some applications. Further discussion on techniques for reducing computational overhead would be beneficial. The discussion on potential speed-ups is too brief.
*   **Justification for Unet-MLP Architecture:** The paper mentions that a naive MLP implementation fails, but the specific reasons why the Unet-MLP architecture is effective could be elaborated upon further. The explanation provided in Appendix B.1 is somewhat high-level. What are the key characteristics of Unet that make it suitable for information extraction in this context?
*   **Limited Discussion on Limitations:** Section E only very briefly covers the limitation about how the diffusion start timestep is selected manually. While the experimental results are good, more focus on where DMBP can fail, or areas where it might not be applicable, would strengthen the paper. For instance, how does DMBP perform on tasks with very high-dimensional or noisy observations (e.g., raw images)? How well does DMBP generalize to environments with different dynamics than the training data?
*   **Missing connection between visualization result and method justification:** Figure 15 visualizes the state and action distributions of the algorithms. While the description explains how DMBP works well on Policy Regularization methods, the Figure does not clearly illustrate these.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** Expand the discussion on hyperparameter selection and sensitivity, particularly for the variance schedule and the diffusion start timestep. Consider exploring adaptive or automated methods for tuning these parameters.
*   **Discuss Computational Cost Mitigation:** Dedicate more space to discussing potential techniques for reducing the computational overhead of DMBP, both during training and testing. Elaborate on the potential of implicit sampling and optimized training schedules.
*   **Elaborate on Unet-MLP Architecture:** Provide a more detailed explanation of the benefits of the Unet-MLP architecture, specifically addressing the weaknesses of a naive MLP implementation and the strengths of the Unet component for information extraction.
*   **Expand Discussion on Limitations:** Provide a more comprehensive discussion of the limitations of DMBP, including its applicability to different types of tasks, observation spaces, and environments. Address how the performance will change without normalization of the state observations.
*   **Figure Improvement:** Make sure Figure 15 visually illustrates the justification for the method in a clearer way.

**Overall:**

DMBP represents a significant advancement in robust offline RL, with a novel approach, strong technical foundation, and compelling experimental results. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact. I would recommend this paper for acceptance, contingent on addressing the points raised in this review.
