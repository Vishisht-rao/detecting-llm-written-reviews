OUTPUT:
This article examines the key issue of understanding the relationship between hyperparameters and loss landscapes in machine learning models, and proposes a framework for fitness landscape analysis (FLA) to analyze and compare hyperparameter loss landscapes. It's a well-written and comprehensive study, and the insights it offers could significantly benefit the AutoML community.

**Strengths:**

*   **Important and Timely Research Question:** The paper addresses a crucial gap in the understanding of hyperparameter optimization (HPO). While many HPO techniques exist, the underlying characteristics of the loss landscapes they operate on are often underexplored. Understanding these landscapes can lead to better HPO methods and improved explainability.
*   **Comprehensive Analysis:** The scale of the study is impressive. Analyzing 1,500 landscapes across 6 ML models, 67 datasets, and 11 million configurations is a significant undertaking. This large-scale analysis provides robust evidence for the conclusions drawn.
*   **Novel FLA Framework:** The proposed framework offers several improvements over existing methods, including a neighborhood-aware visualization technique for high-dimensional landscapes, a suite of FLA metrics, and similarity metrics based on performance rankings tailored for the HPO context.
*   **Clear and Well-Structured:** The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The introduction clearly outlines the problem, the proposed solution, and the key findings. The experimental setup and results are presented logically.
*   **Unified Portrait of Loss Landscapes:** The paper identifies general properties of hyperparameter loss landscapes (smoothness, neutrality, modality) and demonstrates their transferability across datasets and fidelities. This provides valuable insights for designing and understanding HPO algorithms.
*   **Addresses Overfitting:** The analysis of training vs. test loss landscapes, with the exploration of how HP values contribute to overfitting, is particularly valuable. The visualization of these relationships adds another layer of understanding.
*   **NAS-Bench analysis:** Including NAS-Bench-101 analysis as well as insights from NAS-Bench-201 provides a more general scope to the research.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Computational Cost and Accessibility:** The FLA framework relies on a large number of pre-evaluated data points. This raises questions about its practical applicability in scenarios where exhaustive evaluation is not feasible. While the authors mention integrating it with existing AutoML frameworks for on-the-fly analysis, this aspect requires further elaboration.
*   **Choice of Metrics:** While the chosen FLA metrics cover essential landscape properties, the authors acknowledge the existence of many other metrics. A more detailed justification for the specific choice of metrics used could be beneficial.
*   **Neighborhood Definition:** The choice of the neighborhood structure, particularly the distance function for categorical hyperparameters (defining all values as distance 1), might be simplistic. Exploring alternative neighborhood definitions could reveal different landscape characteristics. This is specifically a constraint of push forward method to NAS datasets, since changes in model architecture is hardly just a step.
*   **Overfitting Discussion Depth:** Figure 5 is interesting, but the discussion on causes of overfitting feels somewhat superficial. Although this paper found out that learning rate, max depth and subsample have significant impact on âˆ†L, the generalizability of a learner should not be monopolized by a single one of them; instead, it depends on their cumulative interactions. Also, such generalization gap is also related to dataset characteristics and weakly correlated across models. The paper should expand this.
*   **Lack of comparison with other landscape similarity measurement techniques:** There exist other landscape similarity measuremnt techniques.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Scalability and On-the-Fly Analysis:** Elaborate on how the FLA framework can be integrated with existing AutoML frameworks for on-the-fly analysis. Discuss techniques to reduce the computational cost of landscape construction, such as active sampling or surrogate models. Address cases where pre-evaluations cannot be performed.
*   **Justification of Metric Choices:** Provide a more detailed justification for the selection of FLA metrics used in the study. Discuss the limitations of these metrics and potential biases they might introduce. Explain the relevance of each metric to algorithm behavior in the context of HPO.
*   **Neighborhood Structure Sensitivity Analysis:** Conduct a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of different neighborhood definitions on the measured landscape characteristics. Explore alternative distance functions for categorical hyperparameters, considering potential ordinal relationships or domain-specific knowledge.
*   **Further Discussion on Overfitting:** Elaborate the relationship between dataset characteristics and the generalization gap for XGBoost. Are there specific dataset properties that make XGBoost more prone to overfitting?
*   **Broader literature comparison on Landscape Similarity:** Add comparison in related works to differentiate between this paper and previously published landscape similarity works.

**Overall Recommendation:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the understanding of hyperparameter optimization. The strengths of the study outweigh the weaknesses, and the insights it provides are valuable for the AutoML community. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions addressing the suggestions outlined above. The framework presented has a lot of potential for further analysis, and this work provides a very solid foundation for future research.
