OUTPUT:
The article addresses the key topic of memorization in diffusion models, a subject of increasing importance given the potential risks associated with privacy leakage and copyright infringement. The paper presents a comprehensive empirical study investigating the factors influencing memorization, offering a novel metric called "Effective Model Memorization (EMM)" to quantify this behavior. The core idea of contrasting the theoretical optimum (which replicates training data) with the observed generalization capabilities of real-world diffusion models is well-motivated and provides a solid foundation for the investigation.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Relevance:** The paper tackles a timely and relevant problem. The connection between the theoretical optimum and empirical performance of diffusion models is insightful.
*   **Comprehensive Empirical Analysis:** The paper explores a wide range of factors affecting memorization, including data distribution, model configuration, and training procedure. The experiments are well-designed and the results are clearly presented.
*   **EMM Metric:** The proposed EMM metric provides a useful way to quantify memorization behavior and compare different models and training settings.
*   **Surprising Findings:** The discovery that conditioning on random labels can trigger memorization is a significant and intriguing result.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors emphasize reproducibility, providing code and detailed experimental setup.
*   **Well-written and organized:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, with a clear structure and logical flow.

**Weaknesses and Suggestions:**

*   **Definition of Memorization:** While the ℓ2 distance-based memorization criterion is borrowed from previous work, it is crucial to consider whether it fully captures the nuances of memorization in generative models. Is an ℓ2 distance of 1/3 sufficient to claim memorization? A more in-depth discussion and justification for this threshold would strengthen the paper. Including a qualitative analysis (e.g., showing examples where the metric correctly/incorrectly identifies memorization) could improve the validity of this claim.

*   **Theoretical Justification for EMM:** Although the EMM metric is useful, more theoretical justification or connection to existing memorization metrics in deep learning could provide a stronger foundation for its usage. Is EMM related to VC-dimension or other complexity measures?

*   **Clarity on Definition 1:** While Hypothesis 1 is presented as a basis for estimating EMM, the wording makes it seem as if it can only be applied when the sampled data D1 is a subset of D2. Can EMM still be calculated when D1 and D2 are simply sampled from the same distribution, without one being a subset of the other? Clarification is required here.
*   **Practical Implications of High EMM with Random Labels:** While the observation that random labels trigger memorization is interesting, the paper could explore the practical implications of this finding in more detail. For instance, can this effect be used to enhance privacy in diffusion models or to identify potential vulnerabilities? The practical use of this discovery is unclear, and should be considered.
*   **Limited FFHQ Experiments:** The FFHQ experiments in the appendix are a good addition, but they could be expanded to explore a wider range of factors.

*   **Reproducibility Limitations:** The paper states that "due to difficulty for repeating all experiments, we run each experiment once in the main paper". Although the authors report an insignificant variance in memorization ratios, a more rigorous experimental setup, including averaging the results over multiple random seeds for all experiments, would increase the confidence in the reported results.

*   **Related Work:** The related work section is comprehensive, but it could be further strengthened by explicitly discussing how this work differs from and builds upon the existing literature. Consider explicitly calling out the novel contributions in relation to the existing memorization extraction attacks on diffusion models.
*   **Minor points:**
    *   Eq (15) is hard to read. Can the softmax operation be explained more clearly?
    *   Typos should be corrected. For example, "contracts" should be "contradicts".
    *   Consider using a more consistent notation in the appendix. For instance, z = z_ξ or z = z_t1 (t1 is closed to 0).
    *   Section 5: Consider reporting variance values alongside memorization metrics.

**Overall Assessment:**

This is a strong paper that makes a valuable contribution to the understanding of memorization in diffusion models. The empirical analysis is comprehensive, the EMM metric is novel, and the findings regarding random labels are intriguing. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper and make it an even more impactful contribution to the field.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend this paper for acceptance, conditional on addressing the weaknesses and suggestions outlined above.
