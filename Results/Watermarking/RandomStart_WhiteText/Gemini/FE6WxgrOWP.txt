OUTPUT:
This research explores the key aspect of enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by incorporating visual intuition through a novel Chain-of-Images (CoI) approach. The paper introduces the CoI concept, a method for converting complex language reasoning problems into simpler pattern recognition tasks by generating a series of images as intermediate representations. It also presents a new CoI evaluation dataset (CoIEval) and a symbolic multimodal LLM (SyMLLM) designed to generate images based on language instructions. The paper demonstrates through experiments on various tasks, including geometry, chess, topology, temporal reasoning, and commonsense, that CoI significantly improves performance compared to pure-language Chain-of-Thought (CoT) baselines.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The CoI approach is a fresh and innovative idea for leveraging visual intuition in LLMs, moving beyond simple image alignment towards a more integrated reasoning process. The concept of converting complex reasoning into pattern recognition is compelling.
*   **Well-defined Problem:** The paper clearly identifies the limitations of current LLMs in utilizing visual information for reasoning and proposes a concrete solution.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The introduction of the CoIEval dataset is a significant contribution. The dataset covers a diverse range of domains where images can intuitively aid problem-solving, providing a valuable benchmark for future research. The selection of tasks (Geometry, Chess, etc.) are appropriate for showcasing the advantages of the proposed approach.
*   **SyMLLM Design:** The SyMLLM design, with its ability to generate images based on symbolic representations derived from language instructions, is a valuable component of the CoI framework. The rationale for using symbolic representations over diffusion models (control and precision) is well-explained. The SVG format usage is well-justified.
*   **Strong Experimental Results:** The experiments provide compelling evidence for the effectiveness of CoI. The significant performance improvements over CoT baselines on various tasks demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach. The ablation experiments, such as comparing single vs. multiple images in the reasoning process, provide further insights.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The figures are informative and help to illustrate the key concepts. The introduction clearly sets the stage for the proposed approach. The related work section adequately covers the relevant literature.
*   **Reproducibility:** the authors seem to provide enough detail to reproduce their work, including the datasets, training details and model structures.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Explanation of SyMLLM Architecture:** While the paper mentions the SyMLLM architecture, it lacks detailed information about the image encoder, the MLP that connects the LLM and the image encoder, and how these components are trained. More specifics on the architecture and training procedure would be beneficial.
*   **Scalability/Generalizability of SyMLLM:** The SyMLLM is shown to be very effective on abstract images, but the experiments with Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 3 suggest that image generation quality is a crucial factor in performance. The paper should discuss the limitations of SyMLLM for more complex, real-world images and the challenges in scaling the symbolic representation approach. Is it limited to tasks where SVG representation is suitable?
*   **Error Analysis:** While Figure 7 shows failure cases for the Geometry task, a more in-depth error analysis across all tasks would be valuable. Understanding the types of errors that CoI still struggles with could provide insights for future improvements.
*   **Limited In-Context Learning Results:** The in-context learning results in Table 4, while showcasing the potential of CoI with GPT-4V, are not as strong as the fine-tuned SyMLLM results. The paper acknowledges the limitations due to OpenAI's rate limits, but a discussion of potential factors contributing to the weaker performance and directions for improvement would be helpful.
*   **Commonsense experiment:** While the inclusion of the commonsense experiment is positive, the task could be more challenging. The improvement in commonsense tasks is relatively small and should be interpreted cautiously.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Provide More Details on SyMLLM:** Expand the description of the SyMLLM architecture and training procedure, including details about the image encoder, MLP, and training data.
*   **Address Scalability/Generalizability of SyMLLM:** Discuss the limitations of SyMLLM for more complex, real-world images and the challenges in scaling the symbolic representation approach.
*   **Conduct a More In-Depth Error Analysis:** Analyze the types of errors that CoI still struggles with across all tasks.
*   **Explore Different Image Generation Techniques:** Investigate the use of other image generation techniques, such as more advanced diffusion models with better control and precision, to further improve the performance of CoI.
*   **Investigate the limitations of CoI** For example, the increased complexity required to generate the images (SVG code), and the potential failure modes due to image generation errors.
*   **Broaden the scope of the common sense experiment:** Include more tasks to assess the effectiveness of the commonsense aspect.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a compelling and novel approach to enhancing reasoning in LLMs by incorporating visual intuition. The CoI method, combined with the SyMLLM framework and the CoIEval dataset, represents a significant contribution to the field. While there are some areas for improvement, the paper provides strong evidence for the potential of CoI and opens up promising avenues for future research. I recommend this paper for acceptance, with consideration of the suggestions for improvement.
