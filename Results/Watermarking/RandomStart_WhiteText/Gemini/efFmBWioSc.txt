OUTPUT:
This paper addresses a critical problem in autonomous web navigation: the reliance on extensive online reinforcement learning and domain-specific model designs, which hinder generalization from broader datasets. The authors introduce WebGUM, a multimodal web navigation agent that leverages instruction-finetuned foundation models for offline training. By jointly fine-tuning a language model and a vision encoder with temporal and local perception, WebGUM demonstrates significant improvements over existing offline methods, even surpassing online-finetuned state-of-the-art agents, human performance, and GPT-4-based agents on the MiniWoB benchmark. Furthermore, WebGUM exhibits strong positive transfer to real-world planning tasks on Mind2Web and achieves superior performance to PaLM-540B on the WebShop benchmark. The authors also contribute a large-scale, high-quality multimodal demonstration dataset to facilitate future research in this area.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the review:

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses a significant problem:** The paper tackles a key limitation in web navigation research by focusing on data-driven offline training to avoid the challenges associated with online RL.
*   **Novel approach:** The proposed WebGUM architecture is innovative, effectively combining instruction-finetuned language models and vision encoders for grounded multimodal perception.
*   **Strong empirical results:** The experimental results are impressive, demonstrating substantial improvements on multiple benchmarks (MiniWoB, WebShop, and Mind2Web). WebGUM's performance compared to baselines, including online RL methods and LLM-based agents, is particularly noteworthy.
*   **Comprehensive ablation studies:** The paper includes thorough ablation studies to analyze the contribution of different components of WebGUM, providing valuable insights into its performance. The analysis of temporal and local multimodal perception, dataset and model size scaling, HTML comprehension, and multi-step reasoning is well-executed.
*   **Valuable dataset contribution:** The authors release a large-scale multimodal dataset, significantly expanding the available resources for web navigation research.
*   **Well-written and clear:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to understand, with clear explanations of the methodology and results. The figures and tables are helpful in visualizing the architecture and performance of WebGUM.

**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Limited discussion of limitations:** While the discussion section mentions some limitations (e.g., the need for internet-scale datasets and broader generalization to real websites), a more in-depth discussion of potential failure cases or scenarios where WebGUM might struggle would be beneficial. For example, what are the types of instructions WebGUM has most difficulty parsing?
*   **Reproducibility concerns:** While the authors provide implementation details, further information about training procedures, hyperparameter tuning, and data preprocessing would improve the reproducibility of the results. Specifying random seeds is good practice.
*   **Dataset composition:** The paper mentions that part of the training data was generated using LLMs, which, while efficient, can introduce biases or limitations. A more detailed analysis of the impact of this data generation approach on the performance and generalization of WebGUM would be valuable. The current statement about excluding those demonstrations from the dataset release is helpful.
*   **Action space:** The action space `function(selector, text)` is a fairly restrictive one. While the paper argues for an open-ended text-based action space via LLM finetuning, is that space actually restricted *again* through this action space definition, and how does this affect performance compared to a true "free form" text output that is not forced to use this restrictive structure?
*   **Analysis of Real-World Failures:** Section 5.5 touches on real world transfer. A stronger analysis would include examples of *failure* cases in the real world scenarios, and how those failure cases differ from the simulated environment failure cases.

**Questions for the Authors:**

*   How sensitive is WebGUM's performance to the quality of the HTML and screenshots? How well does it handle noisy or incomplete data?
*   Could you provide more details on the specific types of instructions used in the training and evaluation datasets? Are there any specific patterns or characteristics that WebGUM struggles with?
*   How does WebGUM handle dynamic content or websites that heavily rely on JavaScript?
*   What are the computational costs associated with training and deploying WebGUM?
*   What techniques are used to ensure the safety and reliability of WebGUM in real-world scenarios?

**Overall Recommendation:**

This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of autonomous web navigation. The proposed WebGUM architecture, the strong empirical results, and the valuable dataset contribution make this paper a strong candidate for acceptance. Addressing the minor weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
