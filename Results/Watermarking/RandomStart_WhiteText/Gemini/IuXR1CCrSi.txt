OUTPUT:
This research addresses the problem of how to best encode graph-structured data as text for consumption by Large Language Models (LLMs) for graph reasoning tasks. The authors present a comprehensive study exploring the impact of graph encoding methods, the nature of graph tasks, and graph structure itself on LLM performance. They introduce a new benchmark, GraphQA, and provide insights into boosting LLM performance on graph reasoning tasks through careful selection of encoders.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Importance:** The paper addresses a relatively understudied problem with significant practical implications. LLMs have shown promise in various domains, but their application to graph-structured data remains a challenge. This work provides valuable insights into bridging this gap.
*   **Comprehensive Study:** The paper systematically explores various aspects of graph encoding, prompt engineering, and graph structure, resulting in a thorough analysis. The inclusion of multiple graph tasks and graph generators strengthens the findings.
*   **Practical Insights:** The paper identifies key factors that influence LLM performance on graph reasoning tasks and provides concrete recommendations for encoding graphs as text. The performance gains reported are substantial and demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach.
*   **New Benchmark:** The introduction of the GraphQA benchmark is a valuable contribution to the community, enabling further research in this area. The emphasis on varied and realistic graph structures is particularly noteworthy.
*   **Well-Organized and Clear:** The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and easy to follow. The use of tables and figures effectively presents the experimental results and key findings.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors provide a link to the code for generating the data, which promotes reproducibility.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Model Evaluation:** The paper primarily focuses on PaLM models (62B and the PaLM 2 variants). While valuable, expanding the evaluation to include other LLMs (e.g., open-source models like Llama 2 or Falcon) would further strengthen the findings and demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed approach. The authors partially addressed this by including results with GPT-3.5-turbo.
*   **Error Analysis:** While the paper presents overall accuracy scores, a more detailed error analysis would be beneficial. Understanding the types of errors LLMs make on different graph tasks and with different encoding methods could provide further insights into their limitations and guide future research. What are common failure cases for each method?
*   **Scalability of Graph Size:** The graphs used in the experiments have a relatively small number of nodes (5-20). Exploring the performance of LLMs on larger and more complex graphs would be relevant to real-world applications.
*   **Expert prompting explanation**: The paper mentions expert prompting, but doesn't explain what the expert prompt contains, only that it starts with "You are a graph analyst".

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand Model Evaluation:** Include results from other LLMs to demonstrate the generalizability of the findings.
*   **Conduct Error Analysis:** Analyze the types of errors LLMs make to gain a deeper understanding of their limitations.
*   **Investigate Scalability:** Explore the performance of LLMs on larger and more complex graphs.
*   **Zero-shot results are slightly confusing.** The results say LLMs perform poorly on tasks but get high results (70%+) on some of the tasks.
*   **Clarify the role of iterative prompting methods**: The paper mentions that "initial experiments showed that iterative prompting methods performed much worse for our tasks, due to cascading errors". Provide a more detailed explanation of why iterative prompting methods failed in this context.
*   **Minor**: Correct typos such as `effect` instead of `affect`.
*   **Minor**: In the abstract, the phrase "inside LLMs" is redundant. You can say "can boost performance on graph reasoning tasks by 4.8% to 61.8%."

**Overall Score:**

I rate this paper as a **Strong Accept**. The paper makes a significant contribution to the understanding of how to effectively use LLMs for graph reasoning tasks. The comprehensive study, practical insights, and new benchmark make this work valuable to the research community. Addressing the minor weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements would further enhance the quality of the paper.
