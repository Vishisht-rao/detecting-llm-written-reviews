OUTPUT:
The paper focuses on an important issue in medical imaging: deformable image registration (DIR). The authors introduce a novel plug-and-play image registration network (PIRATE) and its extension, PIRATE+, for DIR. The core idea is to leverage a pre-trained CNN denoiser as a regularizer within an iterative optimization framework. PIRATE+ further fine-tunes this denoiser using deep equilibrium learning (DEQ) to incorporate task-specific information. The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on OASIS and CANDI datasets, evaluated using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and ratio of negative Jacobian determinant (JD).

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The paper presents a novel approach to DIR by integrating a CNN denoiser as a regularizer within a PnP framework. This is a departure from traditional deep learning methods that directly estimate the registration field. The extension to PIRATE+ using DEQ for fine-tuning the denoiser is also a significant contribution.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and clearly explains the proposed methods, PIRATE and PIRATE+. The illustration of the PIRATE and PIRATE+ pipelines in Figure 1 is particularly helpful. The explanations of PnP, DEQ, and the loss functions are comprehensive and accessible.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The paper provides a thorough experimental evaluation on two widely used datasets, OASIS and CANDI. The use of DSC and negative JD as evaluation metrics is appropriate for assessing registration accuracy and physical plausibility. The comparison against several benchmark methods demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach.
*   **Ablation Study:** The ablation study in Table 2 effectively demonstrates the contribution of each component in PIRATE+, including the penalty function, denoiser regularizer, smoothness regularizer, and DEQ refinement.
*   **Convergence Analysis:** The convergence experiment presented in Figure 4 validates the convergence behavior of PIRATE+.
*   **Addressing a Gap:** The paper explicitly addresses a gap in the literature by exploring the use of denoisers to specify priors over registration fields, something that has been largely unexplored.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Computational Cost:** The paper mentions that PIRATE+ has a longer training time than traditional DL methods but lacks a detailed analysis of the computational complexity and scalability of the proposed methods. Table 6 contains some information, but more detail is needed. How does the runtime change with image size?
*   **Parameter Sensitivity:** The implementation details mention the tuning of parameters like γ0, α, and τ. A more systematic analysis of the sensitivity of the methods to these parameters would be valuable. How sensitive are the results to the denoiser architecture used (DnCNN)?
*   **Limited Scope of Datasets:** While OASIS and CANDI are standard datasets for brain MRI registration, the paper could benefit from evaluating the methods on other anatomies or imaging modalities to demonstrate their generalizability. The inclusion of the EMPRIE10 lung CT dataset alleviates this somewhat.
*   **Justification for DnCNN ground truth:** It is concerning that NODEO is used to create the ground truth for the denoiser, and then PIRATE/PIRATE+ outperforms NODEO. What is the justification for this? Are there other options?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand the Computational Analysis:** Provide a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of PIRATE and PIRATE+, including memory requirements and running time for both training and inference. Include the average number of iterations required for convergence in PIRATE+.
*   **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis:** Conduct a sensitivity analysis of the key parameters (e.g., γ0, α, τ, noise level in denoiser training) to understand their impact on performance and guide parameter selection.
*   **More Diverse Datasets:** Consider evaluating the methods on other anatomies or imaging modalities to demonstrate their generalizability.
*   **Address DnCNN Ground Truth Concerns:** Provide a more compelling justification for using NODEO to generate the ground truth for the denoiser and consider other options.

**Overall:**

The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of deformable image registration. The proposed PIRATE and PIRATE+ methods are novel, well-explained, and experimentally validated. The integration of a CNN denoiser as a regularizer within a PnP framework is a promising approach, and the extension to PIRATE+ using DEQ further enhances its performance. Addressing the weaknesses and incorporating the suggestions for improvement would strengthen the paper and increase its impact.
