OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the key problem of improving AI model robustness, particularly in scenarios with limited real-world data, by leveraging synthetic data as a validation set and within a continual learning framework. The paper focuses on early cancer detection in CT volumes, a domain where data scarcity, sensitivity, and domain shifts pose significant challenges. The core idea is to generate synthetic tumors and superimpose them onto healthy organs, creating a diverse and controlled validation dataset to mitigate overfitting and enhance model selection.  The paper also proposes a continual learning framework that continuously trains AI models on a stream of out-domain data, supplemented with dynamically generated synthetic tumors. The results demonstrate significant improvements in liver tumor segmentation, especially for tiny tumors, compared to models trained and validated solely on real-world data.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses an Important Problem:** The paper tackles a crucial problem in AI development, particularly in healthcare: how to build robust models with limited and biased real-world data. The reliance on synthetic data for validation and continual learning is a promising approach.
*   **Novelty of Synthetic Data for Validation:**  While synthetic data augmentation for training is common, the paper highlights the less explored but potentially significant benefits of using synthetic data specifically for validation, which is a key contribution.
*   **Well-Defined Application:** The application to early cancer detection in CT volumes provides a concrete and clinically relevant context for the research. The focus on tiny tumors and their early detection is particularly compelling.
*   **Clear Methodology:** The paper clearly describes the proposed method, including the modeling-based tumor generator and the continual learning framework. The steps involved in tumor synthesis (shape generation, texture generation, location selection, and post-processing) are explained in detail.
*   **Strong Experimental Results:** The experimental results demonstrate a significant performance improvement using synthetic data for validation and within the continual learning framework. The DSC score improvements and sensitivity increases for detecting small tumors are substantial and convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper includes experiments on both in-domain and out-domain test sets, highlighting the generalization ability of the models trained and validated with synthetic data.  The use of the FLARE'23 dataset for external validation is a strength.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:**  The paper is generally well-written and organized, with a clear introduction, related work section, methods section, experimental results, and conclusion.
*   **Reproducibility:**  The authors mention that the code is attached as supplementary material and will be made publicly available, which greatly enhances the reproducibility and impact of the work.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Computational Cost of Offline Synthetic Data Generation:**  The authors acknowledge the high computational cost of using offline-generated synthetic data for validation. While they mention this as a limitation, more discussion about potential strategies to mitigate this cost (e.g., on-the-fly generation, active learning-inspired validation sampling) would be valuable.
*   **Generalizability of Tumor Generator:** The paper points out that the tumor generator pipeline's design and implementation are challenging to adapt to different organs.  While this is a valid limitation, the paper could benefit from discussing potential avenues to make the tumor synthesis more generalized, such as using generative adversarial networks (GANs) or diffusion models to learn a more data-driven tumor representation.  Also, expanding the discussion of why medical image synthesis works better than natural image synthesis from the current limited paragraph would be helpful.
*   **Subjectivity in Post-Processing:**  The post-processing step involves visual inspection and feedback from medical professionals. While this is important for realism, it introduces an element of subjectivity.  The paper could discuss how this subjectivity is managed and whether any measures are taken to ensure consistency across different medical professionals.
*   **Appendix References:** The appendix is referenced within the main text, implying that the contents of the appendix are important for fully understanding the methods. However, the appendix is very brief, so a fuller treatment of the contents of the appendix within the main body of the paper might be better.
*   **Limited ablation study:** The paper provides a good overall comparison, but lacks an in-depth ablation study of each component of the pipeline. E.g., an ablation study showing performance with/without the shape generation, texture generation, location selection and post processing would add extra weight to the claims being made.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address Computational Cost:**  Discuss potential solutions for reducing the computational cost of using synthetic data for validation, such as on-the-fly generation or more efficient validation sampling strategies.
*   **Explore GANs/Diffusion Models for Tumor Synthesis:**  Discuss the potential of using GANs or diffusion models to learn a more data-driven and generalizable tumor representation, which could address the limitation of adapting the current tumor generator to different organs.
*   **Quantify Subjectivity in Post-Processing:** Describe the process of visual inspection by medical professionals in more detail and discuss measures taken to ensure consistency and minimize subjectivity.
*   **Expand Tumor Synthesis comparison:** Expand the discussion of why medical image synthesis works better than natural image synthesis from the current limited paragraph
*   **Consider adding an ablation study:** A more detailed ablation study on the benefits of each module of the pipeline would strengthen the paper's claims

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and promising approach for improving AI model robustness in data-limited domains. The use of synthetic data for validation and continual learning is a valuable contribution, and the experimental results convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Addressing the minor weaknesses and incorporating the suggestions for improvement would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact. I recommend acceptance subject to addressing the comments raised.
