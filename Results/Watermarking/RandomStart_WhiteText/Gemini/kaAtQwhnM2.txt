OUTPUT:
This paper focuses on the issue of training Energy-Based Models (EBMs) on discrete data, a task traditionally hampered by the need for computationally expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. The authors propose a novel approach based on Energy Discrepancy (ED) that avoids MCMC by perturbing data points to generate negative samples. They explore three types of perturbations: Bernoulli noise, deterministic transforms, and neighbourhood structures. The paper also introduces an importance sampling technique, with both uninformed and gradient-informed proposal distributions, to estimate the energy discrepancy loss efficiently. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on a variety of discrete data tasks, including Ising model training, discrete density estimation, graph generation, and discrete image modeling.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Approach:** The paper presents a compelling alternative to MCMC-based training of EBMs on discrete data. The use of energy discrepancy and perturbation-based negative sampling is a significant contribution.
*   **Theoretical Guarantees:** The ED loss functional has theoretical guarantees, which contrasts with the biases often associated with approximate MCMC methods like Contrastive Divergence (CD). The paper appropriately references and builds upon the theoretical framework of Schröder et al. (2023).
*   **Exploration of Perturbation Strategies:** The exploration of three different perturbation types (Bernoulli, deterministic transforms, and neighbourhood structures) provides a good overview of options for discrete data.
*   **Importance Sampling with Gradient Information:** The use of importance sampling to estimate the ED loss, particularly the introduction of gradient-informed proposals, is a valuable extension that improves sample efficiency.
*   **Comprehensive Empirical Evaluation:** The paper includes a wide range of experiments across different data types and tasks, demonstrating the practical efficacy of the proposed approach. The comparisons to existing methods are generally fair and well-justified. The ablation studies on hyperparameters like w and M add further value.
*   **Clarity of Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, although some sections can be dense. The introduction clearly outlines the problem, the proposed solution, and the contributions.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Novelty of Perturbation Types:** While the combination of ED with specific perturbation methods is novel, the Bernoulli perturbation already appeared in Appendix B.3 of Schroder et al. This aspect should be made clear in the main text.
*   **Justification for Hyperparameter Choices:** While the paper performs some ablation studies, the choices of specific values for hyperparameters like the Bernoulli noise probability (epsilon) and the temperature parameter (tau) could be better justified, especially in relation to the specific datasets and tasks. The discussion about the effect of epsilon is useful but would be more compelling with a more systematic analysis (e.g., error bars on the plots).
*   **Gradient-Informed Grid Perturbation Performance:** The relatively poor performance of gradient-informed grid perturbation compared to the Bernoulli variant needs more detailed analysis. The hypothesis of getting stuck in local modes is plausible but requires further investigation (e.g., visualizing the energy landscape or analyzing the acceptance rate of the proposed flips).
*   **Computational Complexity Analysis:** The time complexity comparison is helpful, but a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of each method (e.g., in terms of the number of energy function evaluations and gradient computations) would be beneficial.
*   **Writing quality:** There are some grammar mistakes and stylistic issues throughout the paper. A thorough proofread will improve the quality of the paper.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Clearly State the Bernoulli perturbation's prior appearance.** Explicitly acknowledge the origins of the Bernoulli perturbation in Schröder et al. (2023).
*   **More Systematic Hyperparameter Analysis:** Provide a more systematic analysis of the impact of key hyperparameters, potentially including error bars or confidence intervals on the performance metrics. Also, provide more specific justifications for the chosen values, relating them to the characteristics of the data.
*   **In-Depth Analysis of Grid Perturbation:** Provide a more in-depth analysis of the limitations of the gradient-informed grid perturbation. Consider visualizing the energy landscape or analyzing the acceptance rate of the proposed flips to support the local mode trapping hypothesis.
*   **Detailed Complexity Analysis:** Include a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of each method, particularly focusing on the number of energy function evaluations and gradient computations.
*   **Broader Comparison on Discrete Image Modelling:** Consider including additional baselines for discrete image modelling to provide a more comprehensive comparison.
*   **Clarify "Mild Conditions" in Proposition 1:** Elaborate on the "mild conditions on q" in Proposition 1.
*   **Proofread:** The paper could benefit from a thorough proofreading.
*   **Figures and Tables:** Refer to figures and tables within the text where appropriate.

**Overall Assessment:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of energy-based modeling, particularly for discrete data. The proposed approach is novel, theoretically sound, and empirically effective. While there are some areas for improvement, the paper is of high quality and warrants acceptance, potentially with minor revisions to address the suggestions above.
