OUTPUT:
The study investigates the issue of graph reconstructability in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), proposing a novel perspective on evaluating GNNs' ability to preserve graph structure within node embeddings. The paper argues that previous GNN expressiveness analyses focus primarily on graph-level tasks like graph isomorphism, neglecting the importance of node-level structural information preservation. The authors introduce the concept of "Graph Reconstructability" and analyze the behavior of GCN and GIN under different feature initialization schemes (identity and contextual features).  They then propose a Graph Reconstructable Neural Network (GRNN) architecture combined with Nearly Orthogonal Random Features (NORF) aiming to improve both reconstructability and efficiency.  The paper presents theoretical analysis, supporting propositions, and experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The paper introduces a new perspective on GNN expressiveness by focusing on graph reconstructability, addressing a gap in existing literature. This perspective is relevant as structural information preservation is critical for many graph mining tasks.
*   **Theoretical Foundation:** The paper provides a solid theoretical framework with clear definitions, propositions, and theorems. The analysis of GCN and GIN under different feature initializations is well-structured and insightful.
*   **GRNN and NORF:** The proposed GRNN architecture and NORF initialization method offer a promising approach to address the limitations of existing GNNs in terms of reconstructability and efficiency. The theoretical justification for GRNN's design is well-presented.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The paper includes extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets, supporting the theoretical findings. The experiments compare GRNN with several baselines and demonstrate its superior performance in reconstructability and relevant graph mining tasks (link prediction and community detection).
*   **Well-written:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it relatively easy to follow the arguments and understand the contributions.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity of Graph Reconstructability Definition:** While the paper defines graph reconstructability, the practical implication and evaluation method could be further clarified. The connection between "predicting the input adjacency matrix from node features" and Proposition 1 ("distinguishing linked and unlinked node pairs") could be explained more explicitly for readers less familiar with this area.
*   **NORF Generation Details:** The paper mentions uniformly sampling from a unit ball to generate NORF, but the details of how to control the orthogonality threshold δ in practice are somewhat lacking. More specifics on the implementation of NORF would be beneficial for reproducibility.
*   **Practicality of Identity Features:** While identity features are used in the theoretical analysis and experiments, their practicality for very large graphs is questionable due to their high dimensionality. Although NORF addresses this, a more critical discussion of the limitations of identity features in real-world scenarios would be valuable.
*   **Comparison with Other GNN frameworks:** A comparison between the proposed GRNN framework and other Graph learning frameworks should be found in the main paper, instead of Appendix C. This is crucial to highlight the uniqueness and contribution of the research.
*   **Minor Issues:**
    *   There are some typos ("ih" instead of "in" on page 2, for example) and formatting inconsistencies throughout the paper.
    *   The reference to Cotta et al. (2021) in footnote 1 could be expanded slightly to further clarify the difference between graph reconstruction conjecture and the paper's notion of graph reconstructability.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   Provide a more intuitive explanation of graph reconstructability and its connection to Proposition 1.  Consider adding a visual illustration to aid understanding.
*   Elaborate on the practical implementation details of NORF generation, including how to control the orthogonality threshold δ.
*   Expand the discussion on the limitations of identity features, even when combined with GRNN, in handling very large graphs.
*   Revise and polish the writing to eliminate typos and improve clarity.
*   Consider additional experiments or analyses to further strengthen the claims, perhaps investigating the impact of different levels of graph sparsity or the performance of GRNN on other graph mining tasks.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that introduces a novel perspective on GNN expressiveness and proposes a promising architecture with theoretical justification and experimental validation. The weaknesses are relatively minor and can be addressed with further clarification and polish. I recommend acceptance, pending the incorporation of the suggested improvements.
