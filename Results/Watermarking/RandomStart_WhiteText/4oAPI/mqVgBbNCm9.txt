**Review of "Skeleton-of-Thought: Prompting LLMs for Efficient Parallel Generation"**

**Summary:**
The study focuses on a critical context in natural language processing (NLP) â€” the inference latency of large language models (LLMs). It introduces a novel method called Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT), which proposes an innovative approach to parallel decoding that mimics the human thinking process. By generating a skeletal structure of the answer before expanding each point in parallel, the authors claim that SoT not only significantly reduces inference time but can also enhance the quality of the generated responses. The paper evaluates SoT across 12 different LLMs and addresses the method's advantages and limitations through various experiments and metrics.

**Strengths:**

1. **Relevance and Motivation:** The paper tackles a pressing challenge in the deployment of LLMs: the latency involved in sequential token generation. By anchoring their approach in human cognitive processes, the authors present a compelling argument for their method's efficacy.

2. **Experimental Rigor:** The paper employs a comprehensive experimental design, testing against a diverse set of 12 models across different categories of questions. By reporting on multiple performance metrics, including speed-up and quality (using both general and detailed metrics), the evaluation presents a well-rounded view of SoT's effectiveness.

3. **Practical Implications:** The findings have meaningful implications for real-world applications, especially in conversational systems where reduced latency can improve user experience. This work opens avenues for using LLMs in contexts requiring rapid response times.

4. **Clear Methodology:** The methodology is well-defined and discussed systematically. The two-stage process of generating a skeleton followed by parallel expansion is straightforward yet innovative, with clear delineation of steps and experimental setups.

5. **Future Directions:** The paper does an admirable job of recognizing the limitations of the current study and proposing future research directions, such as further prompts and techniques to improve answer quality while maintaining efficiency.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Generalization of Findings:** While the results are robust across the tested models and question categories, the authors speculate on situations where SoT may not be as effective (e.g., coding and complex reasoning tasks). It may benefit the paper to further explore these cases and potentially propose alternative strategies for such question types.

2. **Comparison with Other Methods:** The authors could strengthen their position by discussing SoT relative to existing techniques aimed at reducing inference latency, such as speculative decoding or non-autoregressive generation. Comparative analysis could offer insights into the relative strengths and weaknesses of SoT.

3. **Subjective Evaluation Metrics:** While LLM-based evaluation frameworks are used to assess answer quality, the potential biases of LLMs as evaluators should be addressed. Incorporating human evaluations could mitigate these concerns and lend additional credibility to the results.

4. **Complexity of Router Implementation:** The paper discusses a router module for adaptively triggering SoT, but the practicality of implementing this in a real-world scenario remains unaddressed. A deeper exploration of the performance trade-offs and computational costs associated with this framework would be valuable.

5. **Clarity in Sections:** Some sections, particularly the appendices, could benefit from more concise explanations to aid reader comprehension without overwhelming them with excessive detail.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the work presents a promising advance in the efficiency of LLM inference through the SoT approach. It illuminates potential pathways to unlocking faster, higher-quality responses in conversational AI systems. Addressing the identified weaknesses could further solidify the significance of this research in both academic and practical realms. The paper merits consideration for publication, with the potential for a broad impact on the field of NLP and beyond.
