**Review of "Object2Scene: Putting Objects in Context for Open-Vocabulary 3D Detection"**

This manuscript investigates a critical issue in the field of open-vocabulary 3D object detection: the challenge of detecting and localizing objects that do not have ground-truth annotations in the training dataset. The authors propose a novel method, Object2Scene, that leverages large-scale 3D object datasets to enrich existing 3D scene datasets. Their approach consists of inserting 3D objects from various sources into 3D scenes and generating text prompts for these objects, addressing both the vocabulary limitation and the annotation inconsistency inherent in traditional methods.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach:** The introduction of Object2Scene as a method to augment 3D scene datasets is a significant advancement in open-vocabulary detection. By utilizing 3D object datasets, the authors circumvent the need for potentially problematic 2D image alignments and exploit the unique nature of 3D spaces.

2. **Unified Framework:** The proposed model, L3Det, unifies 3D detection and language grounding effectively. The utilization of a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture is well-suited for the task, and the inclusion of multiple loss components (localization, alignment, and contrastive learning) ensures a comprehensive training strategy.

3. **Extensive Experiments:** The paper provides thorough evaluations on established benchmarks (OV-ScanNet20, OV-SUN RGB-D20, and OV-ScanNet200) and demonstrates superior performance compared to previous methods. The empirical validation supports the efficacy of the proposed approach, contributing valuable insights into the potential for open-vocabulary capability in 3D detection.

4. **Ablation Studies:** The extensive ablation studies convincingly illustrate the importance of various components of the proposed framework, such as the role of prompt types and contrastive learning. This depth of analysis enhances the clarity of the results and demonstrates the careful consideration of design choices.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Clarity and Structure:** While the manuscript is comprehensive, certain sections could benefit from improved clarity and organization. For instance, the description of the ablation studies could be more concise to enhance the reader's comprehension. Highlighting the key findings or insights from the studies in a dedicated summary could provide better guidance.

2. **Qualitative Results:** Although qualitative results are presented, a deeper discussion on the failure cases would be beneficial. Understanding the types of scenarios where the model fails (such as detection of obstructed objects) could inform future research directions and model refinements.

3. **Limitations and Future Work:** While the authors briefly mention limitations and future work, a more detailed exposition could help contextualize the current contributions. Discussing potential sources of bias in the data and exploring strategies to mitigate them, as well as addressing the computational cost associated with augmenting the datasets, would enrich the discussion.

4. **Transferability Insights:** The transferability results are promising but could be more experimentally rigorous. Evaluating performance across more diverse datasets or scenarios would strengthen claims regarding the robustness and generalizability of the proposed method.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the manuscript provides a significant contribution to the domain of open-vocabulary 3D object detection through the development of Object2Scene and its integration within a unified detection framework. The experimental results validate the authors' claims, and the methodology presents a viable route for future advancements in 3D perception. However, enhancing the clarity of the exposition, discussing limitations in greater detail, and expanding on transferability evaluations would improve the comprehensiveness of this work. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
