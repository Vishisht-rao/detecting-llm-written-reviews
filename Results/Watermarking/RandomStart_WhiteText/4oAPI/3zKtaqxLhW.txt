**Review of "On-Policy Distillation of Language Models: Learning from Self-Generated Mistakes"**

This paper investigates an important aspect of knowledge distillation (KD) in the context of auto-regressive language models. Specifically, it presents a novel approach termed Generalized Knowledge Distillation (GKD), which aims to address the distribution mismatch between output sequences generated during student model inference and those witnessed during training. The authors propose employing on-policy student-generated outputs for distillation, adjusted through feedback from a teacher model, thus enhancing the efficiency and efficacy of distillation.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty of the Approach**: The introduction of GKD as a method to leverage the student’s own generative capabilities is a significant advancement in the field. Previous methods typically relied on static datasets, which limited their adaptability to the student’s evolving capabilities.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The authors provide extensive empirical evaluations across multiple tasks—summarization, translation, and arithmetic reasoning—using various student sizes and diverse divergence measures. This thorough assessment strengthens the claims made about the improved performance of GKD in comparison to existing methods.

3. **Versatile Applications**: The ability to integrate GKD with reinforcement learning fine-tuning presents exciting opportunities for enhancing model capabilities while aligning them more closely with user preferences, as shown in the proposed approach that combines GKD with reinforcement learning feedback for factual consistency.

4. **Rich Framework**: The paper effectively unifies existing KD methods for language models while introducing new ways to leverage on-policy learning for distillation. The flexibility in choosing divergence metrics also adds a significant dimension to the framework.

5. **Scalability**: The findings demonstrate that GKD can effectively scale with smaller student models while still achieving competitive performance, making it a valuable tool for practical applications in resource-constrained environments.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Technical Complexity**: While the methodology is robust, the technical details can be somewhat overwhelming, especially for readers less familiar with concepts such as KL divergence or on-policy learning. A more straightforward exposition or visual representation of the key ideas could improve accessibility.

2. **Baseline Comparisons**: Although multiple baselines are discussed, further exploration of more recent distillation techniques or variations of existing methods could strengthen the claims. Moreover, comparisons with state-of-the-art models beyond the historical context of KD could provide more insight into the relative performance of GKD.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**: The reliance on standard metrics such as ROUGE and BLEU may limit the evaluation of the generative capabilities of the models in certain tasks. Including a qualitative analysis or user studies could offer additional perspectives on the practical applicability and readability of the text generated by the student models.

4. **Generative Quality**: While GKD shows improvements in alignment and performance metrics, a deeper investigation into the quality of the generative output—such as fluency, coherence, and factual accuracy—could further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Metrics such as perplexity or human evaluation would be beneficial in this context.

**Conclusion**: 

Overall, this paper makes a noteworthy contribution to the field of model distillation for language processing, providing a novel perspective on integrating self-generated outputs into the training process. The proposed GKD framework shows promising results that could benefit practitioners aiming to deploy more efficient models. The research presents both theoretical advancements and practical implications, although the strengths highlighted could be further augmented by addressing the noted weaknesses. Future work could focus on refining the methodology for enhanced clarity and expanding the comparison landscape to include the latest advancements in the field.
