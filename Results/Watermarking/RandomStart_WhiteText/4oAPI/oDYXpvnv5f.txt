**Review of "Deep Anti-Regularized Ensembles"**

This study focuses on the key context of uncertainty quantification in high-dimensional regression and classification tasks using deep ensembles, addressing a major limitation where current methods tend to produce overconfident predictions for out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The authors propose a novel method termed Deep Anti-Regularized Ensembles (DARE), which introduces an anti-regularization technique that penalizes small weights within ensemble networks, thereby enhancing the diversity of predictions while maintaining accuracy in the in-distribution domain.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Contribution**: The paper makes a significant contribution by introducing a new approach (DARE) that targets the trade-off between in-distribution accuracy and OOD prediction uncertainty without relying on out-of-distribution data or additional hyperparameter tuning. This innovation is essential for real-world applications where data distribution can shift unpredictably.

2. **Theoretical Foundation**: The authors provide a solid theoretical framework to support their method. The "water-filling" interpretation offers an intuitive understanding of how variance is distributed among the network weights, enhancing the theoretical rigor of the proposed method.

3. **Extensive Experiments**: The experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DARE against various baseline methods, including traditional deep ensembles and contemporary OOD detection techniques. The results show clear improvements in uncertainty quantification, particularly in the regression tasks on the CityCam dataset.

4. **Practical Reproducibility**: The authors emphasize the reproducibility of their results by providing the source code and detailed descriptions of their experimental setups, which aligns with the growing need for transparency in research.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Generality of Method**: While the paper presents strong results using fully-connected networks, the claims regarding the applicability of DARE to other architectures (such as CNNs) remain largely untested. The assertion that DARE can seamlessly integrate with architectures beyond fully-connected layers would benefit from additional experimentation.

2. **Threshold Heuristic**: The choice of the control threshold (τ) for the anti-regularization process is still heuristic-driven, which may lead to suboptimal outcomes. A more systematic approach for determining this threshold could enhance the robustness of the DARE framework.

3. **Limited OOD Scenarios**: The experiments mainly focus on well-defined OOD detection scenarios. Future work should explore a broader range of OOD conditions to further validate the method's effectiveness across diverse practical scenarios.

4. **Lack of Comparative Analysis**: Although the paper compares DARE against several state-of-the-art methods, a deeper comparative analysis discussing the scenarios under which DARE outperforms these techniques would strengthen the paper. Specifically, examining potential weaknesses in competing methods would elucidate DARE’s advantages.

**Conclusion**:

Overall, the paper provides a valuable advancement in the domain of uncertainty quantification with deep learning. The proposed DARE method, backed by a strong theoretical foundation and extensive empirical validation, represents a meaningful step toward enhancing predictive reliability in machine learning applications facing distributional shifts. Addressing the highlighted weaknesses in future work will help solidify DARE's position as a comprehensive solution for uncertainty quantification in deep learning. I recommend accepting this paper for its contributions to the field, while encouraging authors to consider the suggested improvements.
