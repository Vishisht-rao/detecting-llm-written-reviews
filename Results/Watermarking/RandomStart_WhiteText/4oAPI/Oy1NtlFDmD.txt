**Review of "STRUCT DROP: A STRUCTURED RANDOM ALGORITHM TOWARDS EFFICIENT LARGE-SCALE GRAPH TRAINING"**

This study investigates a critical aspect of graph neural networks (GNNs), specifically their inefficiency in training on large-scale graphs due to the heavy computation of sparse operations. The authors propose a novel method called StructDrop, which entails selective random sampling of columns and rows in sparse matrices to optimize the efficiency of GNN training. They identify two main issues with traditional sampling methods: inefficiency during memory access and potential under-fitting due to consistent sampling patterns. StructDrop aims to address these concerns, demonstrating improvements in both training speed and model accuracy across various datasets.

### Strengths:
1. **Novel Contribution**: The introduction of StructDrop as a method to uniformly sample column-row pairs presents a significant advancement in accelerating sparse matrix operations during GNN training. This could have far-reaching implications for scaling GNNs in real-world applications.

2. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The authors conduct extensive experiments comparing StructDrop against existing methods (e.g., traditional full-batch training, top-k sampling, and DropEdge), demonstrating significant efficiency gains. The presented results quantify speedups (up to 6.48x for end-to-end training) while maintaining or even improving accuracy, lending strong support to the effectiveness of the proposed method.

3. **Insightful Analysis**: The paper provides a compelling analysis of the underfitting issues associated with existing sampling techniques and how Uniform Sampling mitigates this risk. Moreover, the incorporation of instance normalization to stabilize node embeddings amidst random sampling is a thoughtful enhancement that adds depth to the proposed methodology.

4. **Clear Data Presentation**: The paper includes informative tables and figures that effectively summarize the performance of StructDrop across different datasets and conditions. The visualizations clarify how the proposed method compares against baselines both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

### Weaknesses:
1. **Limited Theoretical Analysis**: While the empirical results are strong, the paper could benefit from a more formal theoretical analysis underpinning the benefits of uniform sampling over traditional approaches. Exploring the mathematical guarantees of the proposed method would add robustness to the claims.

2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: The reliance on a sampling ratio as the primary hyperparameter raises questions about optimization. Detailed ablation studies are provided, but further exploration of how StructDrop can be adaptive to different datasets or GNN architectures would enhance the practical applicability of the approach.

3. **Scalability Considerations**: Although the experiments are conducted on large datasets, a discussion on the scalability of StructDrop in extremely large graph scenarios, especially in distributed computing environments, is relatively lacking. As GNNs are often deployed in such contexts, insights into how well StructDrop generalizes or performs in these situations would be valuable.

4. **Absence of Competitive Baselines**: The paper could improve by including comparisons against more recent or alternative advanced GNN training techniques. This would better contextualize the impact of StructDrop and showcase its relative advantages or disadvantages more comprehensively.

### Conclusion:
Overall, this paper presents a significant advancement in the field of GNN training by introducing a practical and effective method for accelerating sparse operations through uniform random sampling. The method shows promise, particularly in addressing underfitting issues and enhancing generalization. Although there are areas that require further theoretical underpinning and exploration, the empirical results strongly support the claims made. This work is a commendable contribution to the ongoing research into optimizing GNN performance on large-scale graphs and holds potential for broad applicability in the field. 

**Recommendations for Acceptance**: With minor revisions that address the noted weaknesses, the paper should be considered for acceptance at the ICLR 2024 conference.
