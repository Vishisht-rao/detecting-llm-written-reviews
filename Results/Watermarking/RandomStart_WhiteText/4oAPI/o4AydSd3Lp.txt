**Review of "Harnessing Discrete Representations for Continual Reinforcement Learning"**

The research focuses on an important issue in the field of reinforcement learning (RL): the representation of observations. Specifically, the authors conduct a comprehensive empirical investigation into the utilization of discrete representations—specifically one-hot encoded categorical values—as opposed to traditional continuous representations within the realm of continual reinforcement learning. This challenge is crucial as agents are increasingly required to adapt to dynamic and complex environments, and their performance heavily relies on the quality of input representation.

**Strengths:**

1. **Thorough Literature Review and Contextualization:** The paper effectively situates itself within the broader context of RL. The references to past work, such as those by Hafner et al., van den Oord et al., and others, provide a solid foundation for the study's motivations and objectives. This demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the advancements in representation learning.

2. **Empirical Validation:** The authors present a diverse set of experiments that systematically compare discrete and continuous representations across various settings, including world-model learning and model-free RL. The use of multiple environments, such as Minigrid, enhances the robustness of the conclusions. Moreover, the methods used to gather and analyze data are well-detailed, allowing for reproducibility.

3. **Distinction between Representation and Informational Content:** A central contribution of the paper is elucidating that the performance advantages of discrete representations may stem from their structural characteristics (e.g., one-hot encoding) rather than merely their discrete nature. This finding challenges existing assumptions in the literature and paves the way for deeper investigations into how representations affect learning in differing RL contexts.

4. **Continual Learning Insights:** The paper addresses the increasingly relevant topic of continual learning in RL settings and illustrates how discrete representations can lead to faster adaptation in agents. This is particularly pertinent as real-world applications often involve environments that change over time.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Exploration of Alternative Discrete Representations:** While the authors focused on the performance of VQ-V AEs and one-hot encoding, there could be a more extensive exploration of other forms of discrete representations or encoding methods. Incorporating a broader range of techniques may yield further insights into their applicability and performance across different RL settings.

2. **Interpretability of Results:** Although the results demonstrate clear trends, some findings—particularly regarding the trade-offs between speed of initial learning and performance in dynamic environments—could benefit from a deeper analysis or discussion. Further exploration into why certain representations lead to faster adaptation or superior performance would provide valuable context for practitioners and researchers.

3. **Scalability Considerations:** While the paper discusses the benefits of discrete representations in smaller environments, attention to how these findings could scale to more complex domains or real-world applications would strengthen the paper. It would be beneficial to discuss potential limitations or challenges related to scaling these approaches to larger, more intricate environments, which is where continual RL is particularly critical.

4. **Clarity in Presentation:** The paper is somewhat dense, and certain sections could benefit from clearer explanations, particularly when discussing technical details of the methodologies or the significance of specific experiments. Simplifying explanations and ensuring that non-specialist readers can follow the central arguments would increase accessibility.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of reinforcement learning by delving into the importance of representation in continual learning settings. The empirical findings bolster its claims and suggest significant implications for the design of future RL agents. Addressing the weaknesses mentioned above—especially clarifying the implications of findings and exploring alternative discrete representations—would enhance the paper's impact. The research is poised to influence future endeavors in representation learning and continual reinforcement learning, and it is recommended for presentation at ICLR 2024.
