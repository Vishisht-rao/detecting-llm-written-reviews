**Review of the Paper "WHAT’S IN MY BIG DATA?" by Yanai Elazar et al.**

**Summary:**
The paper addresses a critical area in machine learning and language models—understanding large text corpora used for training. The authors introduce the WIMBD platform, which allows for scalable analysis of large datasets (over 35 terabytes) across various dimensions, including data quality, statistics, societal implications, and contamination in benchmark datasets. The findings reveal significant issues like high rates of duplicate content, the presence of personally identifiable information (PII), toxic language, and contamination of evaluation benchmarks.

**Strengths:**
1. **Timely and Relevant Topic:** As language models become more ubiquitous and impactful, understanding their training data is of paramount importance. This work responds directly to concerns about data quality and transparency in AI.

2. **Robust Methodology:** The use of scalable techniques (count and search functionalities) allows for detailed analyses across various datasets. This is commendable, as it provides a practical tool for researchers in the field.

3. **Comprehensive Findings:** The paper presents extensive analyses of ten different corpora, revealing unexpected patterns like high duplication rates (e.g., 50% duplicates in RedPajama) and benchmark contaminations. This level of detail enriches the discourse around data utilization in training language models and informs future dataset construction.

4. **Open Source Contribution:** Opening the platform for public use and extending the existing framework encourages collaborative development and scrutiny within the research community.

5. **Clarity of Presentation:** The paper effectively presents complex data in a structured and coherent manner, with reasonable explanations of methodologies and findings.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Scope of PII and Toxicity Analysis:** While the identification of PII and toxic language is impressive, the reliance on regular expressions and existing taxonomies could lead to false negatives/positives. A more nuanced approach that incorporates context and semantic understanding could enhance the robustness of these findings. Nevertheless, the authors acknowledge the limitations in estimating recall and overall sensitivity of PII.

2. **Analysis Depth:** Despite the comprehensive nature of advanced statistical analyses, the analysis could delve deeper into implications. For instance, discussing how these findings may impact the future landscape of language model training or their potential ethical ramifications would enhance the relevance of the results.

3. **Benchmark Contamination:** While the analysis of dataset contamination is crucial, the paper could further elaborate on the methodological choices made in detecting contamination. For example, the authors state that they ignore output fields which can vary across datasets. Elaborating more on the rationale behind this choice could strengthen the validity of their findings.

4. **Dependence on Elasticsearch:** While Elasticsearch is known for its powerful search capabilities, the paper's heavy reliance on it may be seen as a limitation, particularly for fuzzy search capabilities. Exploring other potential databases or indexing tools could provide more flexibility and accuracy in future analyses.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Include a discussion on the ethical implications of privacy issues raised by the presence of PII in training data.
- Broaden the ontology for identifying toxic language beyond predefined keywords and incorporate models that analyze sentiment to appreciate the nuance of potentially harmful language.
- Address benchmark contamination evaluation methods in more detail to specify the potential sources of biases in the contamination results.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to understanding the hidden complexities within large text corpora used for training language models. The authors’ findings on data quality and transparency are significant for the advancement of AI ethics, model transparency, and robust research practices in machine learning. WIMBD stands to be a pivotal tool for future research, well-suited to improve the integrity and quality of the datasets used in machine learning applications. The paper is recommended for acceptance, taking into account the points for improvement noted above.
