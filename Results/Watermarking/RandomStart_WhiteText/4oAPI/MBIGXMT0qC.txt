**Review of "MULTI-SCALE PROTEIN LANGUAGE MODEL FOR UNIFIED MOLECULAR MODELING"**

This article explores a critical problem in the field of molecular modeling: the limitation of current protein language models, which predominantly operate at the residue level and fail to effectively incorporate atomic-level information. The authors propose ms-ESM, a multi-scale protein language model aimed at enabling unified molecular modeling that incorporates both protein and small molecular data, leveraging a novel pre-training approach and multi-scale position encoding.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach:** The proposition of a multi-scale model that integrates both residue and atomic information is a significant advancement in the field. By using a code-switching technique analogous to multilingual models, the authors effectively address the challenges of vocabulary incompatibility across different scales.

2. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The authors present a thorough experimental evaluation across various tasks, including protein-molecule tasks, protein-only tasks, and molecule-only tasks. The model's performance is not only competitive but often surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, lending strong support to the efficacy of ms-ESM.

3. **Clear Methodological Framework:** The paper clearly delineates the methodology employed in creating the multi-scale code-switch sequences and position encodings. The authors effectively describe the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Pair-wise Distance Recovery (PDR) tasks, providing transparency in their innovative approach.

4. **Detailed Ablation Studies:** The extensive ablation studies included allow for an understanding of how different components of the model contribute to overall performance. This level of detail assists in justifying the model's architecture and provides insights into areas for potential future work.

5. **Well-Sequenced Literature Review:** The introduction and related work sections are well-structured, providing necessary context for the current study by discussing the progression of protein language models, their applications, and existing challenges.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Scaling Limitations:** While the authors discuss the efficiency of their model in handling molecular data, the paper could benefit from explicitly addressing how the model scales with larger datasets or more complex molecules. The current findings are compelling, but future scalability could be a concern, especially given that proteins can vary substantially in size.

2. **Generalization Across Diverse Chemical Spaces:** The results indicate strong performance in specific tasks, but the paper should elaborate on the ability of the model to generalize across different chemical spaces and molecular types. This aspect is fundamental for practical applications in drug discovery and bioinformatics.

3. **Visualizations:** The visualization comparisons presented in the paper could be enhanced. While they illustrate differences between ms-ESM and prior models, clearer interpretation of how these differences translate into improved model performance could provide added value to the findings.

4. **Potential for Overfitting:** Given the model's complexity and the volume of parameters, potential overfitting risks might exist, especially with smaller datasets. The authors should consider addressing how they plan to mitigate such risks in future work.

5. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** An in-depth discussion on hyperparameter selection, particularly regarding the impact of the weighting of the multi-scale loss functions, could shed light on the sensitivity of the model's performance regarding these choices.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, this paper makes a commendable contribution to the domain of molecular modeling by merging residue and atomic representations into a unified framework. The proposed ms-ESM model appears to be a substantial improvement over existing approaches, achieving promising results and laying the groundwork for future application in multi-scale molecular interactions. With slight adjustments and further exploration as recommended, it could impact both academic research and practical implementations in drug design and protein engineering. The work is well-structured and offers valuable insights into the potentials of multi-scale modeling in biological sciences. I recommend acceptance for presentation at ICLR 2024.
