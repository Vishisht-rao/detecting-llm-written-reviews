**Review for "LLCP: Learning Latent Causal Processes for Reasoning-based Video Question Answering"**

The article addresses the key issue of addressing limitations found in current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) approaches, particularly their reliance on extensive annotated datasets and their limited capacity for causal reasoning. This paper proposes a novel framework, Learning Latent Causal Processes (LLCP), that aims to mitigate these challenges by integrating a causal framework into the VideoQA paradigm.

### Summary:
The authors have introduced LLCP as a self-supervised, causality-driven model that utilizes a temporal multivariate generative model (TMGM) to discern the latent causal relationships within video events. By focusing on accident attribution and counterfactual prediction, LLCP effectively addresses two critical reasoning tasks without the need for annotated question-answer pairs, potentially broadening the accessibility and utility of VideoQA systems.

### Strengths:
1. **Innovative Framework**: The self-supervised approach avoids the traditional dependence on paired annotation datasets, which is a significant step forward for practical applications. This can facilitate the deployment of VideoQA systems in settings where annotated data is scarce.

2. **Causal Reasoning**: By framing VideoQA tasks within the context of causal inference, the authors not only enhance the interpretability of the answers but also improve the system's ability to make reasoned predictions about events.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The authors conducted thorough experiments on both synthetic datasets and real-world benchmarks, demonstrating the efficacy of LLCP in identifying root causes of accidents and predicting counterfactual outcomes. The results indicate competitive performance compared to supervised state-of-the-art methodologies.

4. **Methodological Rigor**: The paper provides a detailed methodological framework, including clear definitions and well-thought-out theoretical premises, particularly regarding Granger causality, which strengthens the scientific foundation of LLCP.

5. **Practical Implementations**: The integration of techniques such as grammatical parsing and pre-trained vision-language models (CLIP) offers a practical perspective, ensuring that the model can respond to reasoning questions in a natural language format.

### Weaknesses:
1. **Assumptions of Granger Causality**: The model relies heavily on the assumptions of Granger causality, which may not hold in all real-world scenarios. Future work should explore how to relax these assumptions and account for potential confounders or non-stationary dynamics.

2. **Dependence on Pre-trained Models**: While the authors have chosen pre-trained models to facilitate learning, this reliance might limit the interpretability of the causal processes learned by LLCP. Developing methods to extract causal insights without extensive pre-training would enhance the model's robustness.

3. **Limited Diversity of Datasets**: Although the framework showed effective performance on the datasets utilized (SUTD-TrafficQA and Causal-VidQA), further validation across a broader range of video contexts and scenarios would strengthen the generalizability of the findings.

4. **Complexity of Causal Relationships**: The paper could further elaborate on the complexity of causal relationships that LLCP attempts to model. An explicit discussion on how the framework adapts to more complex scenarios with multiple causation paths might be beneficial.

### Conclusion:
Overall, LLCP presents a promising advancement in the field of VideoQA by integrating causal reasoning into the analytical process. The authors effectively address a significant research gap and provide a framework that not only enhances the reasoning capabilities of VideoQA but also reduces reliance on extensive annotation. Despite some limitations in underlying assumptions and dataset diversity, the contributions of this paper are valuable and should encourage further research into causal-based approaches in multimodal AI systems. The work is well-structured and serves as a substantial step towards more robust, less annotation-dependent VideoQA methodologies. I recommend this paper for acceptance at the conference, as it contributes original and impactful ideas to the community.
