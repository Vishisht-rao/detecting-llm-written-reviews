**Review of "ENCODING SPEAKER-SPECIFIC LATENT SPEECH FEATURES FOR SPEECH SYNTHESIS"**

The manuscript examines the aspect of speaker modeling in speech synthesis, introducing a novel method termed Encoding speaker-specific Latent speech Features (ELF). The authors claim that their approach allows for high-quality synthesis of speech from unseen speakers without the need for additional training on target speaker datasets. The paper presents a thorough review of the relevant literature and identifies the limitations of existing methods, particularly concerning zero-shot synthesis and multi-speaker models. The authors effectively position their contribution within this context, making a compelling case for their methodology.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach**: The proposed ELF method introduces a promising framework for encoding speaker-specific features and synthesizing speech according to these characteristics. The combination of feature discretization and conditioning through attention mechanisms is particularly innovative.

2. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The experiments are extensive, utilizing two publicly available datasets (LibriTTS and VCTK) to evaluate the performance of ELF in various settings, including speaker blending and cross-lingual synthesis. The subjective Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and Subjective Mean Opinion Score (SMOS) evaluations add robustness to the results.

3. **Strong Results**: The comparison results show that ELF outperforms existing models, such as VITS and YourTTS, in terms of speaker similarity, naturalness, and intelligibility. The results indicate a significant improvement in zero-shot scenarios and high-quality output for newly generated artificial speakers.

4. **Reconstruction Ability**: The manuscript presents compelling evidence that the encoded features can accurately reconstruct original speaker characteristics, suggesting a high level of information retained in the latent representation.

5. **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is well-structured and clearly written. Each section logically builds on the previous one, making the research accessible and easy to follow.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Clarification of Limitations**: While the authors present strong results, there could be more discussion regarding potential limitations, particularly about the scenarios where ELF might underperform or fail. For instance, it would be helpful to explore the situations in which the model might struggle with particularly unique or less common speaker characteristics.

2. **Complexity of the Method**: Although the proposed method is comprehensive, the complexity of the model may raise concerns regarding practicality and computational efficiency. The authors could address how the proposed approach can be implemented in real-world applications where resources might be constrained.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: While the paper compares ELF with existing methods, more in-depth analyses of why ELF performed better, particularly in terms of feature extraction and synthesis, would strengthen the argument. Additional insights into the specific contributions of different components of ELF could be beneficial.

4. **Subjective Evaluation Methods**: The evaluation method, particularly using Amazon Mechanical Turk for MOS and SMOS, while valid, may introduce variability based on rater bias or differences in subjective perception. A more rigorous protocol around evaluator selection and a larger, more diverse sample size could improve the reliability of subjective evaluation results.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the manuscript presents a significant advancement in the field of speech synthesis with its innovative ELF framework. The combination of novel methodologies and strong empirical results offers valuable contributions to the literature. Addressing the noted weaknesses in future work could further bolster the robustness and applicability of the findings. I recommend this paper for acceptance, pending minor revisions to enhance clarity on limitations, model complexity, and evaluation methods.
