OUTPUT:
This manuscript investigates an important area of study in the realm of discrete representation learning, specifically focusing on simplifying vector quantization (VQ) in vector quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs). The authors propose a novel approach termed finite scalar quantization (FSQ) that aims to provide a more straightforward and efficient alternative to VQ while maintaining competitive performance on image generation and dense prediction tasks.

### Strengths:

1. **Clear Motivation and Impact**: The authors concisely outline the limitations of traditional VQ, including codebook collapse and optimization challenges, which are prevalent issues that can hinder performance in neural network architectures. By addressing these issues with FSQ, the authors have the potential to influence a wide range of applications in generative modeling and representation learning.

2. **Innovative Methodology**: The proposed FSQ technique offers significant simplifications compared to VQ by utilizing a lower-dimensional representation and defining an implicit codebook based on bounded scalar quantization. This innovative approach has been supported by theoretical insights and empirical results demonstrating its effectiveness.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The authors conduct extensive experiments across several tasks, including image generation with MaskGIT and dense prediction using UViM. The performance metrics presented are thorough, providing detailed insights into how FSQ compares to VQ in terms of reconstruction fidelity, sample quality, and codebook utilization.

4. **Robust Results**: The empirical findings indicate that FSQ not only maintains competitive performance but also achieves higher codebook usage without relying on auxiliary losses. These results suggest that FSQ could be a more efficient alternative to VQ in practical applications.

5. **Broad Applicability**: The promise of FSQ as a "drop-in replacement" for VQ has implications beyond the tasks addressed in this paper, indicating potential for broader adoption in various neural network architectures.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Theoretical Justification**: While the experimental results are promising, a more in-depth theoretical justification for the advantages of FSQ over VQ would bolster the paper. Clarifying why and how the implicit structure of FSQ leads to improved codebook utilization could enhance understanding of this approach's effectiveness.

2. **Comparison with Other Techniques**: The authors primarily focus on comparisons between FSQ and VQ. Including a broader range of state-of-the-art quantization and representation methods (e.g., residual quantization, product quantization) in comparisons would provide readers with a more holistic view of FSQ's performance and could highlight unique benefits.

3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Although the authors provide recommendations for hyperparameters, a discussion on the sensitivity of FSQ to different configurations and their impact on performance metrics would be valuable. This information could guide practitioners in applying FSQ in different contexts.

4. **Future Research Directions**: While the discussion hints at potential future work, a dedicated section on possible research directions or applications of FSQ would help map out the next steps in this area and encourage further exploration.

### Conclusion:

Overall, the manuscript presents a well-structured and compelling piece of research that contributes significantly to the field of discrete representation learning. The innovation of FSQ as a simpler alternative to the complex VQ formulation, combined with strong experimental validation, positions this work as a valuable resource for both researchers and practitioners. With minor improvements in the theoretical exposition and broader comparative analysis, this work has the potential to make a lasting impact in the field.
