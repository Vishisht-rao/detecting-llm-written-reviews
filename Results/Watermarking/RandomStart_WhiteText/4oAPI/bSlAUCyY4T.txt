OUTPUT:
The article addresses the context of knowledge graph completion (KGC) through the lens of tensor decomposition-based (TDB) models. The authors provide a comprehensive overview of existing TDB methods, their theoretical foundations, and the challenges associated with overfitting in these models. This is pertinent due to the increasing demand for efficient KGC methods that can generalize well in practice.

The introduction effectively sets the stage for the research by highlighting the gaps in current TDB models associated with regularization techniques. The authors present a novel intermediate variables regularization (IVR) method, which targets the reduction of overfitting through minimizing the norms of intermediate variables rather than solely focusing on the embedding norms. This approach is innovative and could potentially lead to better generalization of KGC models. Additionally, the authors substantiate their claims with theoretical analyses demonstrating that their IVR method serves as an upper bound for the overlapped trace norm, which correlates with the ability of KGs to represent complex relationships.

The paper is well-organized, with a logical flow from the introduction to the methods and experimental results. The detailed description of TDB models, including the derivation of a general form, is particularly commendable as it provides a solid foundation for understanding the proposed regularization technique. The experimental results are extensive and demonstrate the performance of the proposed IVR method across various datasets, showing considerable improvements over traditional methods (Frobenius norm and N3 norm techniques). This empirical validation strengthens the paper's contributions to the field of KGC.

While the paper does an excellent job presenting the proposed method and its implications, there are areas that could be improved. First, although the related work section provides context, it could benefit from a more thorough comparative analysis of existing regularization methods in terms of performance and applicability to different types of KGC models beyond TDB. This would allow readers to better appreciate the significance of IVR in the broader landscape of KGC solutions.

Furthermore, while the theoretical analysis is compelling, clearer delineation between theoretical findings and their practical implications would enrich the paper. It would be beneficial to emphasize how the results can be translated into practice, for instance, discussing the implications of parameter tuning with IVR in real-world applications of KGC.

Lastly, including an ablation study that not only focuses on hyper-parameters but also investigates the contribution of each term within the IVR framework to overall model performance would provide further insight into the regularization mechanism's efficacy. 

Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of knowledge graph completion, with a novel regularization strategy rooted in sound theoretical analysis and supported by rigorous empirical validation. It is recommended for acceptance to the conference, with minor revisions suggested for clarification and expansion in certain areas as highlighted.
