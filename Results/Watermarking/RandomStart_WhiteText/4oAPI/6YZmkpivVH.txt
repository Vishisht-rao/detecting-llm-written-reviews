**Review of “TPOPT: Efficient Trainable Template Optimization on Low-Dimensional Manifolds”**

**Summary:**
The manuscript focuses on the topic of detecting low-dimensional families of signals or patterns, particularly in the context of matched filtering, which is often limited by computational inefficiencies associated with the scaling of the signal space dimensionality. The authors propose a new approach called TpopT (TemPlate OPTimization) as a more efficient framework for this task. The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the convergence of Riemannian gradient descent for TpopT, demonstrating superior dimension scaling compared to traditional matched filtering methods. Furthermore, the authors present a practical implementation of TpopT that includes nonparametric components and can be trained as a neural network through unrolled optimization.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach:** The proposed method of template optimization offers a promising alternative to traditional template matching techniques by leveraging optimization on the signal manifold. This innovation could prove to be beneficial for various applications that require detecting signals from large and complicated datasets.
   
2. **Theoretical Contributions:** The authors provide a solid theoretical foundation for their proposed framework, including proving the exponential efficiency improvements of Riemannian gradient descent over matched filtering approaches. The discussions on curvature and convergence basins are particularly insightful.
   
3. **Broad Applicability:** The experiments conducted on gravitational wave detection and handwritten digit recognition effectively illustrate the general applicability of TpopT. The significant performance improvements over matched filtering in both domains strengthen the practical relevance of the proposed method.
   
4. **Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation:** The paper presents extensive experiments, including comparisons of efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs between matched filtering and TpopT, demonstrating clear advantages for the latter.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Storage Complexity:** As noted by the authors, the nonparametric extension of TpopT requires dense storage of points and Jacobians, leading to exponential complexity with respect to intrinsic dimensionality. While the authors acknowledge this limitation, further discussion on potential strategies to mitigate this storage requirement could enhance the paper.

2. **Dependence on Data Density:** The proposed smoothing techniques to expand the convergence basin are promising but rely heavily on the density of data samples. The manuscript would benefit from discussions around scenarios where data density may be low, and how TpopT would perform in such cases.

3. **Focus on Synthetic Data:** The experiments on gravitational wave detection utilize synthetic data with a known ground truth. Although this is useful for validating the method, exploring broader and more realistic setups with real gravitational wave data could serve as a strong complement to the current empirical validation.

4. **Implementation Complexity:** While the framework introduces significant efficiency improvements, the unrolled optimization and training aspects may introduce complexities that could hinder practical implementation. A detailed discussion on implementation considerations would be beneficial.

**Overall Evaluation:**
The manuscript presents a well-structured and insightful exploration of template optimization for low-dimensional signal detection. The contributions to both theory and practice are commendable, and the results show promising advancements over existing techniques. Addressing the limitations regarding storage complexities and providing further empirical validations with real-world data would strengthen the manuscript substantially. 

The work is suitable for the conference due to its innovative approach, clarity, and potential impact on the field of signal detection. Overall, I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to clarify and expand on the highlighted weaknesses.
