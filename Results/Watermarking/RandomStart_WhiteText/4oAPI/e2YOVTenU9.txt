**Review of the Paper "ARCHLOCK: LOCKING DNN TRANSFERABILITY AT THE ARCHITECTURE LEVEL WITH A ZERO-COST BINARY PREDICTOR"**

This study addresses the key topic of mitigating the transferability vulnerability in deep neural networks (DNNs) by focusing on architecture-level defenses as opposed to the more conventional weight-level modifications. The authors present a novel approach, ArchLock, which employs a neural architecture search (NAS) framework combined with zero-cost proxies to explore model architectures that exhibit low transferability while maintaining strong performance on a source task. 

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach**: The premise of locking transferability at the architectural level is timely and addresses a significant gap in the existing literature on DNN security. This is particularly relevant in the context of transfer learning, where pre-trained models are adapted to new tasks, often leading to unauthorized exploitation by malicious actors.
   
2. **Methodological Rigor**: The authors employ a clear bi-level optimization framework to balance performance on the source task with degradation on potential target tasks. The incorporation of zero-cost binary predictors helps in efficiently evaluating architectures without incurring high computational costs, making the NAS process more feasible.

3. **Robust Experimental Validation**: The experiments conducted on well-established benchmarks, NAS-Bench-201 and TransNAS-Bench-101, provide solid empirical support for the efficacy of ArchLock. The reported results, indicating substantial reductions in transferability (up to 50%) with minimal degradation of performance on the source tasks, demonstrate the potential practical applicability of the proposed method.

4. **Comprehensive Analysis**: The paper includes detailed discussions on potential challenges, such as simulating unknown target tasks and performance evaluation for these tasks. The predictive mechanisms established for estimating performance on unseen tasks reflect a thoughtful consideration of real-world applications.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Task Embedding Simulation**: While the paper introduces a method for simulating task embeddings using cosine similarity, the robustness of this approach could be further scrutinized. An evaluation of how representative these simulated tasks are compared to real-world scenarios may strengthen the paper. It would be beneficial to explore varying degrees of task similarity more thoroughly and how this impacts the architecture search process.

2. **Breadth of Generalization**: The focus on specific benchmarks is a strength; however, the authors should address the generalizability of their approach across various domains beyond those presented. Future work could address how ArchLock performs in more diverse and complex task settings, as well as in practical applications where target tasks are unknown.

3. **Scalability of the Method**: While the method is shown to be efficient for the tested benchmarks, a discussion on how this approach could scale with larger models or datasets would be valuable. The complexities involved in practical deployment, such as memory and time constraints in real-world applications, need to be considered.

4. **Complexity of Implementation**: The proposed framework's reliance on advanced techniques such as zero-cost proxies and evolutionary search may pose challenges for adoption among practitioners. Guidelines on implementation, including potential pitfalls and required expertise, would enhance the accessibility of this method.

**Overall Impression**: This paper presents a compelling contribution to the field of deep learning security through its innovative approach to locking DNN transferability at the architectural level. The strengths of the methodology and experimental validation are significant. However, addressing the mentioned weaknesses could enhance the robustness and applicability of the proposed solution. The authors are encouraged to consider these aspects in their future work to broaden the impact of ArchLock within the community. 

**Recommendation**: Accept with minor revisions.
