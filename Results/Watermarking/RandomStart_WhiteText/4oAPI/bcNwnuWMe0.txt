**Review of "Exploiting River Network Topology for Flood Forecasting with Graph Neural Networks"**

**Summary:**
The manuscript focuses on a critical area concerning the forecasting of river discharge in the context of flood prediction, leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to potentially improve prediction accuracy by integrating river network topology. The authors present a well-structured study utilizing the LamaH-CE dataset, exploring various adjacency definitions to analyze their impact on forecasting performance. The findings indicate that traditional data-driven methodologies may be more effective than models utilizing relational information derived from graph topologies.

**Strengths:**
1. **Timely and Relevant Topic:** The ongoing issues posed by climate change and increasing flood events render the subject matter of this paper not only relevant but urgent for both academic and practical applications in disaster management.

2. **Robust Methodology:** The authors employ a comprehensive experimental design that considers multiple GNN architectures and adjacency definitions. They conduct rigorous cross-validation and performance comparison with a baseline MLP, which enhances the reliability of their results.

3. **Clear Data Processing Description:** The methodology section provides a detailed account of data preprocessing, including gauge filtering and the choices made for defining the adjacency matrix, which helps in understanding the experimental setup.

4. **In-depth Performance Analysis:** The results present a thorough comparison across different GNN configurations, revealing insightful conclusions about the limited benefit of incorporating the river network topology in discharge forecasting. The design allows for nuanced discussions around the predictive capabilities of GNNs in hydrological contexts.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Ambiguity in Contribution:** While the study presents significant findings, it may benefit from a clearer articulation of its contributions to existing literature. The paper's conclusion suggests a potential rationale for separate gauge treatment without completely addressing why GNNs may not leverage topology effectively compared to existing models.

2. **Interpretation of Results:** The claim that "the model fails to benefit from the river network topology information" could be better substantiated with discussions on possible reasons, such as the limitations of GNN structures in this specific domain or potential non-linearities in the data that might not be captured by the chosen architectures.

3. **Consideration of Alternative Approaches:** The paper implies a need to explore specialized model architectures without suggesting specific alternatives. Including literature on other promising methodologies that utilize graph structures effectively could enhance the discussion.

4. **Implications for Future Work:** While the manuscript rightly emphasizes the focus on spike prediction, the discussion around data collection in low-income countries and its impact on flood forecasting could be further expanded. It could provide a broader context for the research implications and future directions.

**Technical Quality:**
The technical execution of the manuscript appears sound, with appropriate statistical methods and machine learning techniques utilized. The experimental results are presented in a logical manner, and the statistical significance of findings is clearly articulated.

**Recommendation:**
The paper presents valuable insights into the use of GNNs for flood forecasting, particularly regarding the inadequacies of existing topological integrations. Based on the strengths and weaknesses articulated, I would recommend minor revisions before acceptance, primarily to clarify contributions, strengthen interpretations, and enhance the discussion on future directions. 

**Overall Assessment:**
The study is commendable for its methodological robustness and its critical exploration of an important topical issue, ultimately opening avenues for future research while addressing a pressing global challenge.
