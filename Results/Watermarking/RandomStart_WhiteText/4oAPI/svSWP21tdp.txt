**Review of "FAIRNESS FEEDBACK LOOPS: TRAINING ON SYNTHETIC DATA AMPLIFIES BIAS"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a comprehensive examination of Model-Induced Distribution Shifts (MIDS) in machine learning models, particularly focusing on how training on synthetic data can propagate and amplify biases, which is termed as unfairness feedback loops. The authors introduce a taxonomy for MIDS and propose Algorithmic Reparation (AR) as an intentional means to influence the underlying data distribution for the purpose of mitigating these biases. The paper further illustrates the concepts through empirical experiments that analyze the interplay between generative and supervised models over multiple generations, specifically evaluating their effects on fairness metrics.

**Strengths:**
1. **Relevance of the Issue:** The topic of fairness in machine learning is critically important as AI systems are increasingly used in high-stakes decision-making. The exploration of how biases can be perpetuated and amplified through iterative model updates is timely and relevant.

2. **Theoretical Contribution:** The introduction of MIDS as a comprehensive framework to unify existing concepts related to unfairness feedback loops is a significant theoretical advancement. It helps in clarifying the dynamics between various sources of biases and their interactions over time.

3. **Empirical Validation:** The empirical studies using multiple datasets (ColoredMNIST, ColoredSVHN, and CelebA) are rigorous and provide valuable insights into the effects of MIDS on classifier performances and minority group representation. The experimental setup effectively highlights the degradation of fairness over generations of models.

4. **Addressing Historical Context:** The paper does a commendable job of linking historical injustices, such as redlining, to contemporary AI practices. This contextualization emphasizes the societal implications of biased data and models.

5. **Algorithmic Reparation Framework:** The re-framing of algorithmic reparation as a proactive measure against MIDS presents a novel approach to combatting systemic bias in AI systems. Providing actionable methodologies for mitigation is a significant contribution to both the research and practitioner communities.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity and Clarity:** While the theoretical contributions are significant, the complexity of the concepts introduced could benefit from clearer, more accessible explanations. Terms such as "performative prediction" and "algorithmic reparation" might require more thorough definitions for readers who may not be familiar with them.

2. **Experimental Limitations:** The experiments are grounded in specific datasets, and while they provide compelling results, the generalizability to other domains or real-world scenarios should be discussed more explicitly. Additionally, potential limitations of the datasets used (e.g., biases inherent in CelebA) should be acknowledged to temper enthusiasm for the findings.

3. **Scalability of the Proposed Solutions:** Although the authors propose AR as a solution to mitigate biases, the scalability of such interventions in practice remains questionable. It would be beneficial for the authors to address potential challenges or limitations in implementing AR across varied contexts.

4. **Longitudinal Analysis:** The experiments largely present a snapshot of the MIDS and do not delve deeply into the long-term implications or causal pathways involved. Further investigation into the longer-term effects of applying AR might offer richer insights.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper is a well-crafted contribution to the machine learning fairness literature, successfully highlighting how synthetic data can exacerbate existing biases through MIDS. It opens avenues for further research and potential real-world applications of algorithmic reparation to mitigate these effects. Clarity in presentation and exploration of scalability should be prioritized in revisions to enhance the paper's impact and accessibility to a broader audience. I recommend acceptance with moderate revisions.
