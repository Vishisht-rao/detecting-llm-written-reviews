**Review of "CNN Kernels Can Be the Best Shapelets"**

This research explores the issue of time-series modeling, specifically through the integration of shapelet-based techniques and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The authors present a novel approach, named ShapeConv, which classifies and clusters time-series data by utilizing the interpretative strength of shapelets while capitalizing on the representational power of CNNs.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach**: The central contribution of the paper is the formal proof that connects shapelet extraction and CNN feature extraction processes. By establishing this theoretical foundation, the authors convincingly argue for the equivalence between the two methodologies and provide a compelling rationale for combining them.

2. **Practical Implementability**: ShapeConv is designed with practical applications in mind, being a fully differentiable layer suitable for end-to-end optimization. This makes it theoretically sound and also implementable in modern machine learning frameworks. The ability to employ this method in both supervised and unsupervised contexts enhances its utility and reach.

3. **Incorporation of Human Knowledge**: The authors successfully integrate human expertise into the model through strategic initialization of the CNN kernels, enhancing the interpretability of the learned representations. The reported performance gains when using this initialization strategy further underscore the advantage of leveraging expert knowledge.

4. **Extensive Experiments**: A thorough evaluation on numerous benchmark datasets demonstrates that ShapeConv outperforms traditional shapelet methods as well as contemporary deep learning models for time-series classification and clustering. The statistical analyses provided bolster the claims of superior performance.

5. **Focus on Interpretability**: The proposed method retains interpretability, a significant challenge in many deep learning methodologies. By maintaining an interpretable aspect, ShapeConv can potentially be more effective in sensitive applications where understanding the model's decisions is crucial.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity and Clarity**: While the theoretical underpinnings are rigorously presented, the paper could benefit from clearer explanations, especially in sections discussing mathematical formulations. Some readers may find the transitions between theoretical proofs, model implementation details, and empirical results challenging to follow.

2. **Limited Comparison with Other Methods**: Although ShapeConv is compared extensively with a variety of methods, including both traditional shapelet methods and deep learning architectures, deeper insights into how it differentiates itself in specific use cases could elevate the argument for its broader applicability.

3. **Overfitting Concerns**: Given the flexibility of the proposed model, potential pitfalls relating to overfitting, especially in unsupervised settings with scarce data, warrant attention. The paper briefly mentions diversity regularization to mitigate this risk, but further empirical analysis or discussion could clarify how this is achieved in practice.

4. **Human Knowledge Utilization**: While the incorporation of human knowledge is highlighted as a strength, the process by which this knowledge is collected, utilized, and its impact on various datasets could be elaborated upon to better understand the implications for model deployment in real-world scenarios.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, this paper presents a significant advancement in the intersection of time-series modeling techniques, offering promising results through the novel ShapeConv framework. The integration of interpretability into deep learning highlights its relevance in practical applications. While areas for refinement exist, particularly around clarity and depth of certain discussions, the fresh perspective on leveraging CNNs as shapelet approximators in time-series tasks is commendable. Future work could expand upon this foundation by addressing the mentioned weaknesses and exploring more sophisticated applications.
