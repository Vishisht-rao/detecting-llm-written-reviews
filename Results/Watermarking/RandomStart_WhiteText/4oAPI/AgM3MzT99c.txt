**Review of "OMNI: Open-endedness via Models of Human Notions of Interestingness"**

**Overview:**
This conference paper presents a novel approach to enhancing open-ended learning in artificial intelligence through the framework of "Open-endedness via Models of Human Notions of Interestingness" (OMNI). The authors propose utilizing foundation models (FMs) to filter tasks in reinforcement learning environments based on their interestingness, aiming to prioritize tasks that are not only learnable but also deemed worthwhile for exploration. The paper provides an extensive exploration of the challenges surrounding task selection in open-ended AI systems and presents empirical evidence across three distinct environments: Crafter, BabyAI, and AI2-THOR.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach:**
   The paper tackles a significant and often overlooked issue in open-ended learning—how to distinguish between learnable and interesting tasks. By drawing on human notions of interestingness as modeled by FMs, the authors present a compelling solution that builds on the strengths of recent advancements in machine learning.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation:**
   The authors conduct rigorous evaluation across multiple environments, demonstrating the effectiveness of OMNI compared to baseline methodologies like uniform sampling and learning progress. The results are clearly presented, showcasing significant improvements in task success rates when employing the OMNI framework.

3. **Clear Articulation of Challenges:**
   The paper does an excellent job of detailing the challenges faced in open-ended environment learning, such as the prevalence of uninteresting tasks that could distract agents. The discussion surrounding the Achilles heel of open-endedness research is particularly insightful.

4. **Reproducibility and Transparency:**
   The methodology is well-documented, with a clear explanation of the algorithms used, experimental setup, and the metrics applied for evaluation. This transparency aids reproducibility, which is a critical aspect of scientific research.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Theoretical Foundation:**
   While the paper presents practical findings, further discussion on the theoretical underpinnings of what constitutes interestingness might strengthen the work. A more robust framework for understanding the implications of the identified tasks being categorized as "interesting" would enhance the readers' grasp of the significance and potential applications of the findings.

2. **Limitations of FM-based MoI:**
   The authors acknowledge potential limitations with FMs as a model of interestingness (MoI), particularly regarding their reliance on human-generated data. It would be beneficial to elaborate on these limitations, specifically how they might impact the long-term viability of the approach and the robustness of interestingness models.

3. **Exploration of Edge Cases:**
   The paper extensively discusses the differences between interesting and uninteresting tasks, yet it could benefit from an exploration of edge cases or examples where FMs might misclassify tasks. Including such analysis could provide a more nuanced understanding of the approach’s limitations and conditions under which it operates best.

4. **Future Work Directions:**
   While the authors propose several intriguing avenues for future research, a more focused approach on how to operationalize these ideas—particularly concerning human feedback or the integration of multimodal representations—would offer a clearer path forward. Detailed exploratory studies could substantiate claims regarding potential benefits in practical implementations.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, "OMNI: Open-endedness via Models of Human Notions of Interestingness" presents a valuable contribution to the field of AI, advancing the discourse on open-ended learning. The findings suggest a promising relationship between human concepts of interestingness and the efficiency of learning algorithms. However, further theoretical clarity, limitations discussion, and exploration of nuanced scenarios would enhance the depth and applicability of the research. The paper is well-structured, empirically sound, and offers significant implications for the development of adaptable and dynamic AI systems. This work is commendable and promising, and I recommend its acceptance with minor revisions.
