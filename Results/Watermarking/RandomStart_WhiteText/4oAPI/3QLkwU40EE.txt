**Review of "SPTNet: An Efficient Alternative Framework for Generalized Category Discovery with Spatial Prompt Tuning"**

The manuscript addresses an important aspect of modern machine learning that pertains to Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), specifically focusing on the adaptation of pre-trained models to effectively categorize unlabelled images from both seen and unseen categories. The proposed framework, SPTNet, introduces a two-stage iterative approach that couples model parameter tuning with spatial prompt learning, offering promising enhancements to existing methodologies.

### Strengths
1. **Novelty in Approach**: The integration of Spatial Prompt Tuning (SPT) presents a fresh perspective by learning pixel-level prompts for local image regions, allowing for better alignment with the underlying pre-trained models. This innovation is well-grounded in the literature and builds upon recent advances in prompt learning.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The authors conduct thorough experiments across a range of datasets, including both generic and fine-grained categories. The substantial improvements in performance, particularly the reported 10% enhancement over state-of-the-art methods on key benchmarks, lend considerable credibility to their claims.

3. **Efficiency**: Notably, SPTNet achieves its performance improvements with a minimal increase in parameters, only 0.117% of the backbone architecture. This efficiency is laudable and indicates practical applicability in resource-constrained environments.

4. **Clear Presentation**: The manuscript is well-structured with a logical flow from motivation to methodology, experiments, and conclusions. The figures and tables effectively illustrate the results and trends, making it easier for readers to grasp the significance of the proposed contributions.

### Weaknesses
1. **Interpretability**: While the authors claim improvements in representation power through their method, the interpretability aspect of the learned representations remains underexplored. More detailed analysis and visualization could clarify how these spatial prompts contribute to the decision-making process of the model.

2. **Robustness in Cross-Domain Applications**: Although the method shows promising results in the vanilla GCD setting, the performance under domain shifts appears to be an area needing further exploration. The authors should consider additional testing with varied domain conditions to validate the robustness of SPTNet thoroughly.

3. **Comparison with Baselines**: While SPTNet shows significant improvements over existing methods, a clearer delineation of its advantages and possible limitations compared to each specific baseline would enhance the depth of the discussion. Exploring the trade-offs between computational efficiency and performance in more detail would add further value.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- Extend the interpretability section to include more ablation studies that highlight how different components of SPT contribute to model performance and understanding.
- Conduct a detailed analysis of the method's performance in cross-domain scenarios to identify areas for improvement and bolster claims of robustness.
- Reassess the evaluation metrics applicable to GCD, potentially incorporating user-driven metrics or qualitative assessments of the learned categories.

### Conclusion
Overall, "SPTNet: An Efficient Alternative Framework for Generalized Category Discovery with Spatial Prompt Tuning" is a compelling manuscript that introduces a significant advancement in the GCD area. Its proposed techniques are innovative and show potential for real-world applications. Addressing the mentioned weaknesses will further bolster the manuscript's impact and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed systemâ€™s capabilities and limitations.
