### Review of "NEURAL COLLAPSE MEETS DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY: CURIOUS BEHAVIORS OF NOISY SGD WITH NEAR-PERFECT REPRESENTATION LEARNING"

This manuscript explores a critical context by addressing the intersection of neural collapse and differential privacy (DP) within the paradigm of representation learning. The authors provide a systematic investigation into the behaviors of Noisy Stochastic Gradient Descent (NoisySGD) in relation to neural collapse, presenting both theoretical results and empirical evidence. The depth of exploration into the non-robustness of NoisySGD under different conditions of neural collapse is particularly noteworthy.

#### Strengths:

1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The integration of neural collapse dynamics with differential privacy in machine learning contexts (particularly in representation learning) is not widely explored, making this study original and timely.

2. **Clear Theoretical Contributions**: The authors present a series of well-structured theorems that rigorously establish the properties of NoisySGD under conditions of perfect and imperfect neural collapse. The theoretical insights into sample complexity being independent of dimensionality under perfect neural collapse significantly bolster the paper’s contributions.

3. **Empirical Validation**: The empirical analysis using synthetic data and real datasets supports the theoretical claims. The experiments effectively demonstrate the practical impacts of the observed behaviors, making the findings more relatable and applicable for researchers aiming to develop differentially private models.

4. **Mitigation Strategies**: The proposed strategies for addressing the dimension dependency issues arising from perturbations—such as data normalization and PCA—are practical contributions that can guide further work in the field.

5. **Comprehensive Literature Review**: The citations of relevant works provide a robust context for the research, showing how this work builds on existing literature while also paving new avenues for exploration.

#### Weaknesses:

1. **Assumption of Perfect Neural Collapse**: While the results regarding perfect neural collapse are compelling, they heavily rest on the assumption that such collapse occurs. The practical occurrence of this phenomenon across varied datasets and settings should be discussed more extensively.

2. **Complexity of Results**: Some sections, particularly the theoretical proofs, are densely packed with mathematical formulations which may hinder accessibility for a broader audience. While the content is likely clear to experts in the field, additional explanations or simpler illustrations might enhance the readability and comprehension for those less familiar with the details.

3. **Generalizability of Results**: The paper focuses on clear case studies primarily in computer vision contexts (like CIFAR-10 and ImageNet). A broader range of applications, particularly in natural language processing or other domains where differential privacy is crucial, could improve the generalizability of the findings.

4. **Limited Exploration of Class Imbalance**: Despite acknowledging the impactful role of class imbalance on neural collapse and NoisySGD performance, the manuscript could have further explored divergent strategies for addressing this widely prevalent issue in practice.

#### Conclusion:

In summary, this manuscript makes a significant contribution to the understanding of the effects of differential privacy on representation learning in the context of neural collapse. The theoretical insights combined with empirical validation provide a strong foundation for future research. With a few enhancements to address its limitations, this paper can potentially be a key reference for researchers and practitioners engaged in developing differentially private learning algorithms.
