**Review of "Federated Virtual Learning on Heterogeneous Data with Local-Global Distillation"**

The research explores an important topic, namely the integration of dataset distillation within federated learning (FL) settings, specifically addressing the challenges posed by heterogeneous data across participating clients. The proposed approach, Federated Virtual Learning on Heterogeneous Data with Local-Global Distillation (FEDLGD), offers a novel solution by employing both local and global dataset distillation to mitigate the exacerbated heterogeneity issues that arise during the training process.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Contribution**: The paper introduces FEDLGD as a fresh perspective on federated learning, targeting the common problems of data heterogeneity. By highlighting that traditional dataset distillation methods can amplify heterogeneity rather than reduce it, the authors shed light on a previously unaddressed issue. This insight is critical for advancing the field.

2. **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is well-structured, presenting a coherent flow from the introduction to the methodology and the experimental evaluations. The use of clear diagrams, such as Figure 2 depicting the FEDLGD pipeline, aids in comprehending the complex interactions within the proposed method.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The experimental setup is thorough, employing both benchmark and real-world datasets, which adds credibility to the claims of superiority over existing FL methods. The use of multiple client configurations simulates real-world scenarios effectively.

4. **Theoretical Insights**: The inclusion of theoretical analyses supporting the effectiveness of the proposed methods, particularly regarding statistical margins and the relationship between gradient matching and distribution matching, adds depth to the work. This theoretical backing strengthens the validity of the empirical results.

5. **Comparison with State-of-the-Art**: The paper provides a solid comparison of FEDLGD against various state-of-the-art FL algorithms. The results presented indicate a consistent improvement of FEDLGD in terms of test accuracy, which can inspire further research in this direction.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity**: While the introduction of local-global distillation is an interesting concept, the approach could benefit from a more detailed empirical analysis regarding the trade-offs between computational cost and performance improvements. The analysis in Appendix D mentions computation costs, but a more comprehensive discussion on how these costs scale with increased client numbers or larger datasets would be valuable.

2. **Generalizability**: The experiments primarily focus on specific benchmark datasets. While CIFAR10C and medical datasets provide a good range of scenarios, the generalizability of the results to other domains or more diverse datasets needs to be addressed. Future work should consider experimentation in a wider array of data distributions.

3. **Privacy Considerations**: Although the paper mentions data privacy, it would be beneficial to delve deeper into the privacy implications of sharing local model parameters and gradients, even during the global aggregation process. Considerations into the trade-off between efficiency and privacy could be elaborated further, as privacy is a paramount concern in federated contexts.

4. **Limitations Discussion**: While the authors note potential limitations, a more explicit discussion of scenarios where FEDLGD may underperform or fail to realize its advantages over existing methods would provide a balanced perspective.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper presents a significant advancement in the field of federated learning by introducing a method specifically designed to cope with heterogeneous client data through local-global dataset distillation. The contributions are valuable, and the methodology is sound, but there are areas—particularly regarding scalability, privacy implications, and the breadth of experiments—that warrant further exploration. I believe this work will serve as a stepping stone for further research in federated virtual learning, and I encourage the authors to consider the feedback provided in refining this promising approach.
