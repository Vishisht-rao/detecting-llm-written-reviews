**Review of "FASTER APPROXIMATION OF PROBABILISTIC AND DISTRIBUTIONAL VALUES VIA LEAST SQUARES"**

The article focuses on a critical problem in computational efficiency regarding the estimation of probabilistic and distributional values in data valuation, particularly within the framework of cooperative game theory. The authors introduce their Generic Estimator based on Least Squares (GELS) and its variants, aiming to significantly reduce the computational cost of estimating various probabilistic values, achieving an approximation order of \( O(n \log n) \) for many cases. This work follows current trends in improving data valuation methods, which are increasingly important as the datasets used in machine learning grow larger and more complex.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Contribution**: The connection between probabilistic values and least squares regression is effectively established, leading to innovative methods that generalize and improve upon existing estimators for a broader class of values.

2. **Theoretical Guarantees**: The authors provide strong theoretical foundations to support their proposed algorithms, demonstrating efficiency gains over previous approaches like the sampling lift estimator.

3. **Empirical Validation**: The experiments conducted cover a range of datasets and scenarios, validating the faster convergence of GELS and confirming the efficacy of the TrELS framework for training estimators approaching distributional values without supervision. This empirical support enhances the credibility of the theoretical claims.

4. **Robust Methodology**: The framework can leverage generalization from trained models, which has significant implications for practical deployments in machine learning contexts.

5. **Code Availability**: Making code available for their methods allows other researchers to replicate and build upon this work, fostering collaboration and further advancements in the field.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complex Notation**: The paper is dense and laden with complex mathematical formulations, which may pose a barrier to readers who are not deeply familiar with cooperative game theory or advanced statistical methods. A more accessible narrative could greatly aid understanding, particularly in sections discussing algorithms and mathematical proofs.

2. **Limited Discussion on Practical Applications**: While the theoretical aspect is robust, the authors could enhance the practical relevance of their work by providing more insight into how these estimators can be applied in real-world scenarios, particularly in industry applications outside academia.

3. **Comparative Performance**: While the experiments demonstrate the performance of GELS compared to existing techniques, providing clearer visual comparisons or more detailed performance metrics could strengthen the argument for practical superiority.

4. **Assumptions**: Some assumptions underlying their theoretical results, specifically about the distributions of data or characteristics of utility functions, could be more explicitly discussed. It would be beneficial to outline scenarios where the assumptions might not hold and how the estimators would perform in those cases.

5. **Sparse Results Reporting**: The results from the extensive experimentation could benefit from a more structured presentation within the text, possibly through a dedicated results section that summarizes key findings, visual representations, and direct comparisons.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of data valuation and has the potential to impact how data scientists approach probabilistic value estimation in large datasets. The clarity of mathematical exposition could be improved to communicate findings more effectively, and additional insights into practical implementation scenarios would enhance its applicability. Despite minor shortcomings, the work is convincingly argued and thoroughly substantiated, marking it as a valuable resource for further research in this domain. 

The authors are encouraged to consider these areas for improvement in their future work to maximize the effectiveness and reach of their compelling findings.
