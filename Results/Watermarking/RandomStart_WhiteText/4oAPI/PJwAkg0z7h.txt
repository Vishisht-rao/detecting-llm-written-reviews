### Review of "EasyTPP: Towards Open Benchmarking Temporal Point Processes"

**Summary and Contribution:**

The article addresses a key area in machine learning and statistical modeling, namely the evaluation and comparison of temporal point processes (TPPs). The authors highlight the significant challenges faced by researchers in the field due to a lack of standardized benchmarks for TPP models. They introduce EasyTPP, a comprehensive open-source library aimed at promoting reproducibility, facilitating comparisons among various models, and streamlining the development of new methodologies in event sequence modeling. EasyTPP integrates multiple datasets, implements a range of neural and classical models, and offers evaluation protocols, thereby presenting a valuable resource for both academic researchers and industry practitioners.

**Strengths:**

1. **Comprehensive Benchmarking**: The authors provide a unified framework that includes existing datasets, model implementations, and evaluation methodologies. The fact that EasyTPP supports both PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks significantly enhances its accessibility.

2. **User-Friendly Design**: The design of EasyTPP is centered around usability for a wide audience, including researchers and practitioners. The standardized interface for integrating new datasets and models is particularly commendable, as it encourages contributions to the repository.

3. **Extensive Evaluation**: The paper outlines a thorough evaluation methodology for various TPP models, including classical models like the Multivariate Hawkes Process and multiple state-of-the-art neural models. The authors provide experimental results and detailed discussions on model performance across different tasks, enhancing the robustness of their claims.

4. **Future Directions**: The authors propose compelling future research opportunities that could further the field, reflecting a deep understanding of current challenges and potential avenues for growth.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Depth of Evaluation**: While the paper provides comprehensive model evaluations, it may benefit from a deeper examination of the limitations of current approaches. For instance, discussing the implications of different hyperparameter choices could lend useful insights to future users of the library.

2. **Software Maintenance**: The authors mention that they will actively maintain and update the library. However, it would be beneficial to provide a roadmap or timeline for future improvements, which could enhance trust and commitment among potential contributors.

3. **Lack of Comparative Analysis**: The paper could have benefited from a more explicit comparison of EasyTPP with existing libraries and benchmarks in the field, such as Poppy and Tick, despite acknowledging their limitations. Highlighting what differentiates EasyTPP could strengthen the authors' claims for its necessity.

4. **Presentation Issues**: Although the paper is rich in content, the clarity of presentation could be improved in some areas. Specific sections are dense with technical details that might overwhelm readers unfamiliar with TPPs. More visual aids such as flowcharts or diagrams could enhance comprehension.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of temporal point processes by introducing EasyTPP as a benchmark for model evaluation and reproducibility in event sequence modeling. While it has some weaknesses, the strengths of the contribution and the methodologies presented substantially outweigh them. EasyTPP has the potential to foster collaboration in the research community, accelerate advancements in TPP methodologies, and drive real-world applications. I recommend acceptance for presentation at ICLR 2024, with suggestions for addressing the identified weaknesses.
