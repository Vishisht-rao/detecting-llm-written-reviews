**Review of "Addressing Long-Horizon Tasks by Integrating Program Synthesis and State Machines"**

The study explores a critical aspect of reinforcement learning (RL)â€”the challenge of effectively addressing long-horizon tasks, which is especially pertinent in real-world applications where agents must exhibit complex behaviors over extended periods. The authors propose the Program Machine Policies (POMPs) framework, which integrates program synthesis and state machine representations to enhance interpretability and scalability in RL.

### Strengths

1. **Innovative Approach**: The fusion of program synthesis with state machine policies is a novel contribution. This integration not only allows for high-level skill representation through executable programs but also utilizes state machines to capture the transitions between these skills, catering to the long-horizon context that traditional methods struggle with.

2. **Extensive Evaluation**: The experimental design is robust, involving a well-defined set of tasks in the Karel domain, including both existing benchmarks and newly created long-horizon tasks. The comparison against multiple state-of-the-art approaches provides a comprehensive view of POMP's performance.

3. **Inductive Generalization**: The empirical results demonstrating that POMP can generalize to longer horizons without the need for fine-tuning are compelling. This suggests that the proposed framework has significant potential for applications where adaptability and robustness over time are crucial.

4. **Interpretability**: The authors effectively highlight the benefit of using programs as modes in the state machine, emphasizing that these programs are human-readable, enhancing the interpretability of the learned policies, which is a critical issue in AI deployments.

5. **Ablation Studies**: The inclusion of ablation studies is commendable as it provides insights into the effectiveness of each component of the proposed method, justifying the importance of the search algorithm for program retrieval and the necessity of compatibility among modes.

### Weaknesses

1. **Complexity of Implementation**: While the framework is theoretically appealing, the implementation details may pose challenges for replication by others in the field, particularly the integration of the various subsystems (embedding space construction, program retrieval, and transition function learning). More clarity on the integration workflow might be beneficial.

2. **Scalability of Tasks**: The paper demonstrates significant improvements on the Karel tasks, but it would be insightful to see how well POMP scales to more complex environments, potentially with higher-dimensional spaces or more intricate task dynamics, beyond those defined in the current benchmarks.

3. **Limited Engagement with Prior Work**: The paper references several related works but could more deeply engage with the nuances of existing approaches. For example, comparative discussions about the choices made in the paper versus those in hierarchical RL or existing programmatic RL methods could enrich the understanding of the contributions made.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**: While the paper presents mean rewards across tasks, incorporating additional metrics, such as sample efficiency, stability, or task completion rates, would provide a more rounded evaluation of the framework's performance.

5. **Potential Overfitting in Long-Horizon Tasks**: Given the complexity associated with long-horizon tasks and the use of multiple skills, there could be a concern regarding overfitting to the training tasks. Analysis on the robustness of the learned policies to variations in task setup could strengthen the contributions.

### Conclusion

Overall, "Addressing Long-Horizon Tasks by Integrating Program Synthesis and State Machines" makes a substantial contribution to the field of reinforcement learning. It presents a well-researched framework that successfully combines programmatic approaches with state machine representations to tackle the challenges of long-horizon tasks. The results indicate promise for practical applications where human interpretability and adaptability are required. Addressing the highlighted weaknesses could enhance the robustness of the findings and applicability of the frameworks in diverse contexts. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to reinforce clarity and engagement with prior research.
