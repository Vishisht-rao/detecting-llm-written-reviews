**Review of "APD: Boosting Adversarial Transferability via Perturbation Dropout"**

**Summary**
This manuscript explores an important aspect of adversarial machine learning, specifically the transferability of adversarial examples across different deep neural network architectures in black-box settings. The authors propose a novel attack strategy, termed the Adversarial Perturbation Dropout (APD), which integrates the dropout mechanism traditionally used in DNN training to reduce synergy among perturbations, thereby enhancing adversarial transferability. The paper is well-structured, with a clear introduction of the problem, related work, method description, and comprehensive experimental results.

**Strengths**
1. **Innovative Approach**: The introduction of perturbation dropout is a novel concept in the context of adversarial attacks, aiming to reduce the interdependence of perturbations across different regions of the image. This is a fresh perspective that could significantly influence future research in adversarial examples.

2. **Robust Experimental Validation**: The authors provide extensive experiments on widely-used datasets (ImageNet) with various models, benchmarks, and settings. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the APD method compared to several state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods, showcasing substantial improvements in the attack success rates.

3. **Integration Flexibility**: The ability of the APD method to be seamlessly integrated with existing iterative attack frameworks adds to its practical applicability, making it a useful tool for adversarial machine learning practitioners.

4. **Detailed Comparison and Analysis**: The authors include ablation studies examining the impact of various parameters, the efficacy of different dropout strategies (selective vs random), and comparisons with other methods (e.g., cutout). This thorough analysis strengthens the methodological contributions of the paper.

5. **Clear Presentation**: The manuscript is well-organized and clearly written, facilitating the understanding of complex technical concepts, even for readers who may not be specialists in adversarial machine learning.

**Weaknesses**
1. **Limited Theoretical Foundation**: While the empirical results are strong, the paper could benefit from a more in-depth theoretical justification for why perturbation synergy affects transferability. Understanding the mechanism behind this phenomenon could further validate the proposed approach and inspire more refined strategies.

2. **Generalization to Other Domains**: The focus on image classification problems (specifically on the ImageNet dataset) might limit the applicability of the findings to other domains. The authors should discuss potential limitations or avenues for extending their approach to other types of data (e.g., time-series or text data).

3. **Consideration of Defense Mechanisms**: Although the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the APD method against various models, it might be worthwhile to include a discussion on how this method interacts with defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks. Acknowledging potential defenses could enhance the manuscript's relevance in the broader context of adversarial robustness.

4. **Granularity in Results Presentation**: While the results are extensively tabulated, providing more visual aids (e.g., graphs and figures) summarizing the key findings would assist in conveying the improvements achieved by the proposed method more effectively.

**Detailed Comments**
- The introduction should explicitly highlight the practical implications of improved adversarial transferability beyond academic interest, potentially discussing real-world applications.
- Consider discussing the ethical implications of improved adversarial attacks, particularly in systems that require high security and robustness, like autonomous vehicles and facial recognition systems.
- An explanation of the computational efficiency and resource requirements for implementing the APD method in practice would be valuable to researchers and practitioners alike.

**Conclusion**
Overall, this manuscript provides a significant contribution to the field of adversarial machine learning by proposing an innovative method for enhancing adversarial transferability via perturbation dropout. The experimental results substantiate the claims made regarding the effectiveness of the approach. However, addressing the theoretical underpinnings and practical implications more thoroughly would strengthen the work. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions addressing these points.
