OUTPUT:
This article addresses a critical problem in the field of partial-label learning (PLL), which is the challenge of effective label disambiguation when faced with excessively large candidate label sets. The authors introduce a novel data-centric approach called candidate label set pruning (CLSP), which holds promise for enhancing the performance of existing deep PLL methods by strategically reducing the size of candidate label sets without the need for extensive training.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Contribution:** The introduction of CLSP as a distinct task within the PLL framework is both timely and relevant. By shifting the focus from learning-centric paradigms to a data-centric perspective, the authors provide a fresh approach to mitigating the challenges associated with large candidate sets.

2. **Theoretical Foundations:** The paper features a thorough theoretical analysis, including the derivation of upper bounds on pruning error rates. This mathematical rigor adds credibility to the proposed method and clarifies the relationship between representation quality, label ambiguity, and pruning error.

3. **Empirical Validation:** Extensive experiments on benchmark-simulated and real-world PLL datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the CLSP method. The results show significant performance improvements across multiple state-of-the-art deep PLL methods under various scenarios, solidifying the practical applicability of the approach.

4. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The comparative performance of multiple deep PLL methods with and without the use of pruned candidate sets provides clear insights into the impact of the proposed pruning strategy. Additionally, the exploration of different candidate label generation models and their effects on performance strengthens the authors' conclusions.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Experimental Clarifications:** While the overall experimental design is robust, certain sections could provide greater clarity on the selection and tuning of hyperparameters (e.g., k and Ï„). A detailed justification for the chosen values would enhance reproducibility and understanding for future research.

2. **Edge Cases and Limitations:** Although the paper considers various settings for candidate label generation, it would benefit from a discussion of potential edge cases or limitations. For instance, how might the pruning method perform with highly ambiguous datasets or when candidate generation introduces substantial noise? Addressing these scenarios could provide a clearer perspective on the method's robustness.

3. **Real-world Applicability:** While the paper demonstrates improvements on the PASCAL VOC dataset, a more in-depth exploration of the implications for real-world applications (beyond academic benchmarks) would enrich the discussion. For instance, insights into the practical considerations for deploying this method in industry contexts where data is noisy or scarce could be beneficial.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of deep partial-label learning by introducing candidate label set pruning (CLSP) as an effective strategy for enhancing label disambiguation through a data-centric lens. The theoretical insights, combined with empirical validation, provide a convincing argument for the utility of the proposed method. With minor improvements in experimental clarity and discussion of limitations, this work could be highly impactful in advancing the state of the art in PLL research and applications. I recommend acceptance for presentation at ICLR 2024.
