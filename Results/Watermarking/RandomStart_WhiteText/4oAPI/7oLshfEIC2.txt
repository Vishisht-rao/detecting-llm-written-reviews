**Review of "TimeMixer: Decomposable Multiscale Mixing for Time Series Forecasting"**

The study explores an important aspect of time series forecasting by introducing a novel architecture termed TimeMixer, which emphasizes the disentanglement of complex temporal variations through a multiscale mixing approach. In the realm of time series forecasting, particularly with the increasing complexity and non-stationarity of real-world data, the contribution of this paper seems timely and relevant.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach**: The core concept of multiscale-mixing, differentiating between fine-scale and coarse-scale representations, is both intuitive and well-grounded. By leveraging both Past-Decomposable-Mixing (PDM) and Future-Multipredictor-Mixing (FMM), the authors make a genuine attempt at addressing complications in forecasting that are not adequately resolved by existing strategies.

2. **Strong Experimental Results**: The empirical evaluation demonstrates that TimeMixer achieves state-of-the-art performance across various long-term and short-term forecasting benchmarks. This is an impressive feat, considering it consistently outperforms other advanced models like PatchTST and SCINet, as judged by multiple metrics, indicating both robustness and reliability.

3. **Extensive Analysis**: The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of multiple components and conduct thorough ablation studies to substantiate the efficacy of their proposed architecture. This enhances the credibility of the claims made regarding the significance of each component in the TimeMixer framework.

4. **Implementation Details and Reproducibility**: The supplementary materials include extensive details on datasets, model configurations, and the codebase, which is crucial for the reproducibility of the results. This commitment to transparency is commendable and adds value to the field.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity of the Model**: While the design principles are compelling, the increased complexity of using a two-fold mixing mechanism (PDM and FMM) could potentially hinder interpretation. It would benefit the paper to include a discussion on the trade-offs between model complexity and forecasting interpretability, particularly for practitioners looking to deploy such models in real-world scenarios.

2. **Limited Scalability Discussion**: While the authors present efficiency analyses in terms of GPU memory and running time, there could have been more emphasis on scalability. As real-world applications often involve very large datasets, a more detailed exploration of potential bottlenecks in computation or memory usage for larger time series lengths would provide additional insights.

3. **Future Work Suggestions**: Although the paper briefly mentions future work relating to alternative design improvements, a deeper examination of how these might be addressed would add depth. Further study into ensemble strategies, variations in decomposition methods, or alternate architectures could enhance the generality of the proposed model.

4. **Comparison with Recent Architectures**: While the paper compares TimeMixer with a solid set of baseline models, it could be beneficial to address how this approach stacks up against more recent innovations specifically targeting temporal patterns in time series data, including hybrid models that combine MLP, CNN, and attention mechanisms.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, "TimeMixer: Decomposable Multiscale Mixing for Time Series Forecasting" makes a significant contribution to the field of time series forecasting. The proposed framework is innovative, and the results presented bolster the potential of the TimeMixer architecture. The paper, while strong, can further refine its impact by addressing scalability, model complexity, and ensuring comprehensive engagements with contemporary research.
