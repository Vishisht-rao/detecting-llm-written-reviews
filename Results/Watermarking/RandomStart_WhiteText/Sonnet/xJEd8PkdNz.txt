OUTPUT:
The paper examines the key aspect of how computational methods impact control performance in integral reinforcement learning (IntRL) for continuous-time systems. Here is my detailed review:

Strengths:
1. Novel Focus: The paper addresses an important but underexplored phenomenon regarding how computational choices, specifically quadrature rules, affect control performance in continuous-time reinforcement learning.

2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide comprehensive theoretical analysis, establishing connections between IntRL's policy iteration and Newton's method applied to Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. The proofs and mathematical derivations are thorough.

3. Clear Convergence Analysis: The paper presents clear convergence rate analyses for different quadrature methods - showing O(N^-2) convergence for trapezoidal rule and O(N^-b) for Bayesian quadrature with Mat√©rn kernel, where N is the number of samples.

4. Practical Validation: The theoretical findings are validated through two canonical control tasks, with detailed experimental results showing how different computational methods affect performance.

5. Strong Technical Foundation: The work builds upon and connects multiple mathematical concepts including reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, Bayesian quadrature, and continuous-time optimal control theory.

Limitations:
1. Restricted Scope: The analysis focuses primarily on IntRL algorithm, while other continuous-time RL methods are not explored.

2. Limited Experimental Validation: Only two relatively simple control tasks are used for validation. Testing on more complex, high-dimensional problems would strengthen the findings.

3. Computational Overhead: The paper does not thoroughly discuss the computational costs of different quadrature methods, particularly for Bayesian quadrature which may be more expensive.

4. Implementation Challenges: While theoretical guarantees are provided, practical implementation challenges and recommendations could be better addressed.

Future Directions:
1. Extending the analysis to other continuous-time RL algorithms.
2. Investigating computational impact in high-dimensional control problems.
3. Developing more efficient quadrature methods specifically designed for continuous-time RL.

Overall, this is a well-written paper that makes significant theoretical contributions to understanding the role of computation in continuous-time reinforcement learning. The results have important implications for designing and implementing continuous-time control algorithms.
