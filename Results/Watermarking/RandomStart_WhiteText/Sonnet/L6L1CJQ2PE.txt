Paper ID: L6L1CJQ2PE
OUTPUT:
The manuscript addresses the key aspect of efficiently editing large language models (LLMs) to update their knowledge while maintaining model performance and avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

Strengths:
1. Novel Contribution: The paper introduces MALMEN, an innovative approach that formulates parameter shift aggregation as a least square problem and uses normal equations for updating LM parameters. This is a significant improvement over existing methods that rely on gradient accumulation.

2. Scalability: The authors demonstrate impressive scaling capabilities, showing that MALMEN can edit hundreds of times more facts than MEND with similar performance and outperforms MEMIT, while maintaining reasonable memory consumption.

3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The work includes extensive experiments across different model architectures (BERT-base, GPT-2, T5-XL, GPT-J) and various knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, providing strong empirical evidence for the method's effectiveness.

4. Memory Efficiency: The separation of computation between hyper-network and LM enables arbitrary batch sizes on both networks, making it feasible to edit multiple facts with constrained memory limits.

5. Thorough Analysis: The paper includes detailed ablation studies and qualitative analysis of failure cases, providing insights into the method's strengths and limitations.

Weaknesses:
1. Computational Complexity: As acknowledged by the authors, MALMEN requires computation with linear complexity in relation to the number of facts for computing the meta gradient, which could be a limitation for very large-scale applications.

2. Generalization Limitations: The method still struggles with generalizing to rephrasings not present in prompts, as noted in the limitations section.

3. Theoretical Foundation: While the empirical results are strong, the theoretical justification for why the least squares formulation works better than gradient accumulation could be more thoroughly developed.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Include more theoretical analysis of why the least squares approach is more effective than gradient accumulation.

2. Provide more discussion on potential approaches to address the generalization limitations.

3. Consider exploring ways to reduce the computational complexity for meta gradient computation.

Overall Impact:
This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of LLM editing. The proposed method demonstrates clear advantages over existing approaches in terms of scalability and memory efficiency, while maintaining competitive performance. The comprehensive evaluation and analysis make the work particularly valuable for both researchers and practitioners working on LLM knowledge updating.
