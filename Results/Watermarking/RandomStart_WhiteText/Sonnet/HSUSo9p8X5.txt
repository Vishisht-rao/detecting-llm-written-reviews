OUTPUT:
The paper examines the key aspect of action space design for robotic manipulation, introducing a novel End-Effector-Elbow (E3) action space that aims to combine the benefits of both joint-based and end-effector-based control approaches.

Strengths:
1. Novel Contribution: The paper introduces an innovative action space formulation that addresses clear limitations in existing approaches, offering a balanced solution between precise control and learning efficiency.

2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors conduct extensive experiments across multiple settings:
- Simulated environments using RLBench
- Real-world implementations
- Multiple robot platforms
- Different task types
- Comparative analysis with existing methods

3. Technical Depth: The paper provides detailed mathematical formulations and two concrete implementations (E3Angle and E3Joint) of their approach, with clear explanations of the advantages and limitations of each.

4. Strong Results: The experimental results demonstrate clear improvements over baseline approaches, particularly in tasks requiring precise control over robot configuration while maintaining sample efficiency.

Weaknesses:
1. Limited Exploration of Failure Cases: While the paper mentions singularity points as a limitation, it could benefit from a more detailed analysis of failure modes and edge cases.

2. Scalability Questions: Though briefly addressed with an 8-DOF example, the paper could further explore how the approach scales to robots with significantly more degrees of freedom.

3. Real-world Validation: While real-world experiments are included, they are somewhat limited in scope compared to the simulation results.

Technical Impact:
The paper makes a significant contribution to robot learning by introducing a practical solution to a fundamental problem in robot control. The E3 action space could become a standard approach for applications requiring both precise control and efficient learning.

Clarity and Presentation:
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with helpful visualizations and comprehensive experimental results. The technical content is accessible while maintaining rigor.

Overall Assessment:
This is a strong paper that makes a valuable contribution to the field of robot learning. The proposed E3 action space addresses a real need in robotic manipulation, and the comprehensive evaluation demonstrates its practical utility. The limitations are acknowledged and discussed honestly. I recommend acceptance of this paper.

Score: 8/10
