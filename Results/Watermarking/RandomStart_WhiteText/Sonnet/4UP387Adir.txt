Paper ID: 4UP387Adir
OUTPUT:
This research addresses an important context in graph contrastive learning (GCL) by exploring its robustness to weak supervision and proposing a novel method to leverage weak labels effectively. Here is my detailed review:

Strengths:
1. Novel Problem Setting: The paper fills an important gap by systematically studying how GCL methods perform under weak supervision, which is common in real-world applications but underexplored.

2. Comprehensive Evaluation: 
- Thorough empirical analysis comparing multiple GCL methods across different noise settings
- Evaluation on 5 diverse benchmark datasets including both homophilous and non-homophilous graphs
- Clear experimental setup with controlled noise levels

3. Technical Innovation:
- Novel WSNET method that effectively combines graph community structure with weak label signals
- Two-part loss function that balances structural and label information
- Demonstrated scalability through effective sampling strategies

4. Strong Results:
- WSNET outperforms baselines across different noise settings
- Particularly strong performance on non-homophilous graphs
- Clear visualization of learned embeddings showing better class separability

Weaknesses:
1. Limited Theoretical Analysis:
- Lacks theoretical justification for why the proposed approach works better
- No formal analysis of the relationship between graph structure and weak labels

2. Parameter Sensitivity:
- Limited discussion of sensitivity to key parameters like community detection algorithms
- Could benefit from more ablation studies on different components

3. Computational Complexity:
- Runtime analysis could be more detailed
- Scalability to very large graphs needs more discussion

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Include theoretical analysis of why combining community structure with weak labels is effective
2. Expand ablation studies to better understand contribution of different components
3. Add more discussion on parameter selection and sensitivity
4. Provide more detailed computational complexity analysis
5. Consider additional baselines from weak supervision literature

Overall Assessment:
This is a strong paper that makes valuable contributions to graph representation learning under weak supervision. The empirical results are convincing and the method appears practical for real-world applications. The limitations are primarily in the theoretical foundations rather than the practical utility of the approach.

Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions to address theoretical foundations and analysis depth.

Impact: This work could have significant impact on applications where clean labels are expensive to obtain but weak supervision is available, which is common in many real-world scenarios.
