OUTPUT:
This research focuses on a critical area in online nonconvex optimization, specifically examining the theoretical bounds and algorithmic approaches when only single oracle feedback is available per time step.

Key strengths of the paper:

1. Novel Problem Setting:
- The paper addresses an important practical setting where only one oracle feedback is available per iteration, which is more realistic than previous work assuming multiple feedbacks
- The analysis focuses on the original objective functions rather than window-smoothed versions, making it more relevant for real applications

2. Comprehensive Theoretical Analysis:
- Provides tight lower bounds for different oracle feedback settings (exact gradient, stochastic gradient, function value)
- Proves optimality of classic algorithms like online gradient descent for linear-span algorithms
- Carefully analyzes how function variation affects optimization hardness

3. Technical Innovation:
- Develops a novel one-point running difference gradient estimator that achieves the same regret bounds as two-point estimators while requiring only single function value feedback
- The estimator addresses high variance issues present in conventional one-point approaches

4. Strong Theoretical Results:
- Establishes that online (stochastic) gradient descent achieves optimal local regret bounds
- Proves high probability bounds in addition to expectation results
- Results capture dependence on problem parameters like function variation

Limitations/Potential Improvements:

1. Limited Empirical Validation:
- The paper is entirely theoretical without experimental results
- Some empirical studies would help validate the practical benefits of the proposed approaches

2. Restricted Algorithm Class:
- Analysis focuses only on linear-span algorithms
- Could explore broader algorithm classes

3. Assumptions:
- Relies on relatively strong smoothness assumptions
- Could investigate performance under weaker conditions

Overall, this is a strong theoretical paper that makes important contributions to online nonconvex optimization theory. The results provide valuable insights for practical applications where feedback is limited, though experimental validation would strengthen the work further.

The writing is clear and well-organized, with careful mathematical development and intuitive explanations of the key ideas. The technical contributions advance our understanding of fundamental limits in online optimization while providing practical algorithmic solutions.

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of the review?
