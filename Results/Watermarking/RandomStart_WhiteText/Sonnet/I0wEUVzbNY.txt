OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the key problem of understanding what pre-trained code models (PCMs) learn and don't learn about code structure and relationships, with a focus on analyzing their self-attention mechanisms and hidden representations.

Key strengths of the paper:

1. Comprehensive Analysis: The study examines multiple aspects of PCMs including self-attention patterns, hidden representations, and relationships between different types of code tokens (syntactic tokens and identifiers). The analysis covers multiple model architectures and training objectives.

2. Novel Findings: The paper reveals important limitations in how PCMs encode relationships between syntactic tokens and identifiers, which helps explain why these models sometimes fail to generalize beyond their training data.

3. Rigorous Methodology: The authors employ multiple analysis techniques including attention analysis, probing tasks, and visualization methods. They also critically examine assumptions made in previous works.

4. Practical Implications: The findings provide concrete insights that could help improve PCM architectures and training objectives.

Weaknesses/Limitations:

1. Limited Model Selection: While the paper examines several models, it focuses mainly on smaller encoder-only and encoder-decoder models, excluding larger decoder-only models which are increasingly common in code generation.

2. Dataset Scope: The analysis primarily uses the CodeSearchNet dataset, and it would be valuable to see if the findings generalize across different datasets.

3. Solution Direction: While the paper identifies limitations in current PCMs, it could provide more concrete suggestions for addressing these limitations.

Suggestions for improvement:

1. Include analysis of larger decoder-only models to make the findings more comprehensive.
2. Provide more specific recommendations for improving PCM architectures based on the findings.
3. Validate findings across multiple datasets to strengthen generalizability claims.

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes valuable contributions to understanding PCMs' capabilities and limitations. The findings are well-supported by extensive experiments and analysis, and the work provides important insights for future research in this area.

Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions (addressing some of the limitations mentioned above).
