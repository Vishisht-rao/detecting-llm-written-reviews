Paper ID: 8j9hz8DVi8
OUTPUT:
The article explores the issue of efficient adaptive regularization methods for training deep neural networks. Here is my detailed review:

Key Contributions:
1. The paper introduces CASPR (Combining AxeS PReconditioners), a novel optimization technique that finds different preconditioners for each mode/axis of matrix-shaped DNN parameters and combines them using a Kronecker-sum based approximation.

2. The authors provide theoretical guarantees showing that CASPR is ordered between full-matrix Adagrad and Shampoo preconditioners in Loewner order, leading to tighter convergence guarantees compared to Shampoo.

3. Extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates CASPR's effectiveness on various tasks including graph neural networks, Transformers, and large language models.

Strengths:
- Strong theoretical foundation with rigorous proofs and convergence guarantees
- Comprehensive experimental validation across different architectures and tasks
- Clear improvements over existing methods like Shampoo and Adam
- Simple implementation requiring only minor modifications to existing Shampoo code
- Practical applicability demonstrated on large-scale models

Weaknesses:
- The computational complexity remains O(m³ + n³), similar to Shampoo
- Limited discussion of potential failure cases or limitations
- Could benefit from more ablation studies exploring different hyperparameter settings

Technical Merit:
The paper is technically sound with well-structured proofs and clear mathematical derivations. The Kronecker-sum approximation approach is novel and well-motivated.

Experimental Validation:
The experiments are comprehensive, covering:
- Graph neural networks on OGBG-molpcba
- Transformers on universal dependencies dataset
- Auto-regressive language modeling on C4 dataset
The results consistently show improvements over baseline methods.

Impact:
CASPR appears to be a meaningful advancement in optimization methods for deep learning, offering better convergence properties while maintaining practical applicability. The method could be particularly valuable for training large-scale models where optimization efficiency is crucial.

Overall Assessment:
This is a strong paper that makes both theoretical and practical contributions to deep learning optimization. The combination of rigorous theory and strong empirical results makes it a valuable addition to the field. I recommend acceptance.

Recommendations for Improvement:
1. Include more detailed analysis of failure cases
2. Add ablation studies on hyperparameter sensitivity
3. Expand discussion of computational trade-offs
4. Provide more insights into when CASPR might be most beneficial versus existing methods
