OUTPUT:
This manuscript explores the aspect of label-free node classification on graphs by leveraging large language models (LLMs) as annotators to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Here is my detailed review:

Strengths:

1. Novel Problem & Solution:
- The paper addresses an important practical challenge of obtaining high-quality labels for graph neural networks
- The proposed LLM-GNN framework provides an innovative solution by using LLMs to generate training labels
- The approach effectively combines the complementary strengths of LLMs and GNNs

2. Technical Contributions:
- Development of difficulty-aware active node selection strategy
- Design of confidence-aware annotation generation using LLMs
- Post-filtering mechanism to improve annotation quality
- Theoretical analysis backing the proposed methods

3. Comprehensive Evaluation:
- Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
- Thorough ablation studies examining different components
- Strong performance achieving 74.9% accuracy on OGBN-PRODUCTS at low cost
- Detailed analysis of LLM annotation characteristics and quality

4. Cost Effectiveness:
- Demonstrates significant cost savings compared to human annotation
- Achieves comparable performance to manually annotating 400 nodes at under $1 cost
- Provides practical solution for real-world deployment

Weaknesses:

1. Limited Exploration of LLM Selection:
- Primarily focuses on GPT-3.5-turbo without extensive comparison across different LLMs
- Could benefit from more analysis of how different LLM architectures affect performance

2. Structural Information Usage:
- The current approach doesn't fully utilize graph structural information during annotation
- Could potentially be improved by incorporating structure-aware prompting strategies

3. Scalability Analysis:
- While large-scale experiments are included, more detailed analysis of computational costs at different scales would be valuable
- Limited discussion of potential bottlenecks in scaling to even larger graphs

Suggestions for Improvement:

1. Expand LLM Analysis:
- Compare performance across more LLM variants
- Analyze cost-performance tradeoffs for different LLMs

2. Structure Integration:
- Explore methods to incorporate structural information in LLM prompting
- Investigate graph-aware prompting strategies

3. Theoretical Framework:
- Strengthen theoretical analysis of why the proposed approach works
- Provide more formal guarantees on performance

4. Implementation Details:
- Include more details on hyperparameter selection
- Provide guidelines for selecting appropriate LLM and prompting strategies

Overall Assessment:
This is a strong paper that makes significant contributions to the field of graph learning. The proposed LLM-GNN framework effectively addresses the practical challenge of label scarcity in graph neural networks. The comprehensive empirical evaluation and theoretical analysis support the claims made in the paper. While there are some areas for improvement, the core contributions are valuable and well-presented. I recommend acceptance of this paper.
