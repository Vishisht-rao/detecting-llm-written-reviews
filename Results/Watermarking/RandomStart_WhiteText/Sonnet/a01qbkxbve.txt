OUTPUT:
This research examines a critical problem in leveraging large language models (LLMs) for sequential decision-making tasks. Here is my detailed review:

Strengths:
1. Novel Framework: The paper introduces O3D, an innovative offline learning framework that enables LLMs to learn from large-scale offline data without requiring model fine-tuning. This is particularly valuable given the computational costs and accessibility challenges of LLM fine-tuning.

2. Unified Approach: The framework elegantly unifies both text-based and code-based policy approaches, providing a comprehensive solution that can be applied across different LLM interaction paradigms.

3. Strong Empirical Results: The experiments demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods across multiple LLM versions (GPT-4, GPT-3.5) and two challenging benchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop). The ablation studies effectively validate each component's contribution.

4. Practical Applicability: The method can utilize both successful and failed interaction data, making it more practical for real-world applications where perfect demonstrations may be scarce.

Limitations/Potential Improvements:
1. Scalability Analysis: While the paper shows the framework works well on two benchmarks, a deeper analysis of how the method scales with increasing task complexity or dataset size would be valuable.

2. Computational Requirements: The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the computational costs associated with running O3D compared to baseline approaches.

3. Error Analysis: A more detailed analysis of failure cases could provide insights into the framework's limitations and guide future improvements.

4. Theoretical Foundation: The paper focuses primarily on empirical results. A stronger theoretical foundation explaining why the proposed skill discovery and distillation approach works could strengthen the contribution.

Future Directions:
- Investigating how O3D could be extended to handle more complex, multi-modal tasks
- Exploring ways to reduce the framework's dependence on high-quality LLMs
- Studying how the discovered skills could be transferred across different domains

Overall Impact:
This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of LLM-based sequential decision-making by introducing a practical framework for leveraging offline data. The strong empirical results and unified treatment of text-based and code-based approaches make this work particularly valuable for both researchers and practitioners.
