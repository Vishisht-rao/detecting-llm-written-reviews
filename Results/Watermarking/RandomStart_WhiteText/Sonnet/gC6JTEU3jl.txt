OUTPUT:
This manuscript addresses an important problem in the field of large language model optimization - making LLMs more efficient through pruning while maintaining performance.

Key Strengths:
1. Novel Approach: The paper introduces BESA (Blockwise Parameter-Efficient Sparsity Allocation), which takes a block-wise rather than layer-wise approach to pruning. This allows for better preservation of model performance compared to previous methods.

2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors conduct extensive experiments across multiple model sizes (7B to 70B parameters) and datasets (WikiText2, PTB, C4) to validate their approach. The evaluation includes both perplexity metrics and zero-shot task performance.

3. Technical Innovation: The method introduces differentiable sparsity allocation, allowing for automated learning of optimal pruning rates for different layers rather than using fixed rates. This is more sophisticated than previous approaches like SparseGPT and Wanda.

4. Practical Implementation: The method is efficient, requiring only 5 hours to prune large models like LLaMA2-70B on a single A100 GPU. The authors also demonstrate real-world acceleration using the ViTCoD hardware simulator.

5. Strong Results: BESA consistently outperforms baseline methods across different model sizes and evaluation metrics, sometimes even achieving better performance than the original dense model.

Areas for Improvement:
1. Theoretical Analysis: While the empirical results are strong, the paper could benefit from more theoretical analysis explaining why block-wise pruning works better than layer-wise approaches.

2. Hardware Considerations: The paper primarily focuses on the ViTCoD accelerator for hardware evaluation. Including results on more common hardware platforms would strengthen the practical impact.

3. Parameter Overhead: The method introduces additional parameters (2.10% per transformer block for row-wise setting). A more detailed analysis of this overhead's impact would be valuable.

4. Ablation Studies: While comprehensive, some ablation studies (like the impact of different importance metrics) could be expanded to provide deeper insights into the method's behavior.

Overall Assessment:
This is a strong paper that makes several important contributions to the field of LLM optimization. The proposed BESA method is well-motivated, technically sound, and demonstrates clear improvements over existing approaches. The comprehensive evaluation and practical considerations make this work particularly valuable for both researchers and practitioners working with large language models. The paper is recommended for acceptance with minor revisions to address the suggested improvements.

The work represents a significant step forward in making large language models more efficient and deployable, which is crucial for the broader adoption of these powerful models.
