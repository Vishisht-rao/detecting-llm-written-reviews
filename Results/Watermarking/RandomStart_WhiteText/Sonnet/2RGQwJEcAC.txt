OUTPUT:
This paper investigates a critical area in deep learning - making visual transformers more efficient while maintaining or improving their performance. Here is my detailed review:

Strengths:

1. Novel Technical Contribution:
- The paper proposes DCS-Transformer, which introduces differentiable channel selection in both attention weight computation and MLP features
- The approach is theoretically motivated by the Information Bottleneck principle and includes a novel variational upper bound for the IB loss

2. Strong Technical Validation:
- Comprehensive experiments on image classification and object detection tasks
- Consistent improvements shown across different backbone architectures (MobileViT, EfficientViT)
- Detailed ablation studies analyzing the impact of different components
- Visualization results demonstrate that the channel selection leads to more informative attention weights

3. Practical Impact:
- Achieves better accuracy while reducing FLOPs compared to baselines
- Compatible with existing popular transformer architectures
- End-to-end trainable with standard optimization techniques

4. Well-Written:
- Clear motivation and problem formulation
- Thorough technical details and derivations
- Comprehensive experimental analysis

Weaknesses:

1. Limited Theoretical Analysis:
- While the IB motivation is interesting, deeper theoretical analysis of why channel selection helps could strengthen the paper
- The connection between IB and channel selection could be explained more clearly

2. Experimental Scope:
- Most experiments focus on classification and detection
- Could include more diverse vision tasks to demonstrate broader applicability
- Additional analysis on different types of datasets would be valuable

3. Computational Cost:
- While FLOPs are reduced, training time comparison with baselines is not discussed
- Memory requirements during training are not analyzed

Suggestions for Improvement:

1. Include more theoretical analysis explaining why channel selection leads to more informative attention weights

2. Expand experiments to more vision tasks like semantic segmentation, pose estimation etc.

3. Add analysis of training efficiency and memory requirements

4. Provide more insights into hyperparameter selection and sensitivity

Overall Assessment:
This is a strong paper that makes both theoretical and practical contributions to improving visual transformers. The proposed method is well-motivated, technically sound, and demonstrates clear empirical benefits. The thoroughness of experiments and analysis is commendable. Despite some limitations, the work represents a meaningful advance in making visual transformers more efficient.

Recommendation: Accept (7/10)
The paper's contributions and strong empirical validation outweigh its limitations. The method could have significant practical impact given the widespread use of visual transformers.
