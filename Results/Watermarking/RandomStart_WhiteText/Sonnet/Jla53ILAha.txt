OUTPUT:
The paper addresses an important problem in understanding how auxiliary task learning affects neural network training through multi-task learning (MTL) and pre-training + fine-tuning (PT+FT) approaches.

Strengths:
1. Strong theoretical foundation - The paper provides rigorous theoretical analysis of implicit regularization in diagonal linear networks for both MTL and PT+FT settings.

2. Novel insights - The discovery of a "nested feature selection" regime in PT+FT that biases networks to extract sparse subsets of pretrained features is an important contribution.

3. Comprehensive empirical validation - The theoretical findings are thoroughly validated through experiments on both synthetic data and real image classification tasks.

4. Practical implications - The work suggests concrete ways to improve fine-tuning performance through weight rescaling based on the nested feature selection insight.

5. Clear comparisons - The paper effectively contrasts the behaviors and relative advantages of MTL vs PT+FT across different data availability scenarios.

Weaknesses:
1. Limited scope of theory - The theoretical analysis focuses on simplified diagonal linear networks, though empirical results suggest the insights extend to nonlinear cases.

2. Assumption dependencies - Some theoretical results rely on specific assumptions like gradient flow convergence that may not always hold in practice.

3. Real-world validation - While the CIFAR-100 experiments are valuable, testing on more diverse real-world tasks would strengthen the practical relevance.

Suggestions for improvement:
1. Include more discussion of limitations and assumptions of the theoretical framework.

2. Expand empirical validation to additional architectures and task domains beyond image classification.

3. Provide more concrete guidelines for practitioners on when to use MTL vs PT+FT based on the findings.

4. Further analyze the optimal weight rescaling factor selection for the nested feature selection regime.

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes both theoretical and practical contributions to understanding auxiliary task learning. The theoretical framework provides new insights into how MTL and PT+FT shape learned representations, while the empirical validation and practical recommendations make the work immediately useful to practitioners. The discovery of the nested feature selection regime is particularly notable and could influence how fine-tuning is approached in practice.

The main results appear sound and the writing is clear. While there are some limitations in scope, these do not substantially detract from the paper's valuable contributions to both the theoretical understanding and practical application of auxiliary task learning.
