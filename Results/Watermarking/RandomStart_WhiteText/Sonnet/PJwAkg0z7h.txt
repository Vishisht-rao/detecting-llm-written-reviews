OUTPUT:
This article addresses the problem of lacking standardization and benchmarking in temporal point process (TPP) modeling research, which has impeded progress in comparing methods and reproducing results in this important field.

Key contributions:
- Introduces EasyTPP, the first comprehensive open-source benchmark for TPPs that provides:
  - A unified interface for using existing datasets and adding new ones
  - Standardized evaluation protocols and metrics
  - Implementations of popular neural TPP models
  - Rich library of reusable modules for building complex models
  - Support for both PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks

Strengths:
1. Addresses a clear need in the field by providing standardization and reproducibility
2. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple datasets and metrics
3. Well-documented implementation details and experimental setup
4. Thorough empirical comparisons of 9 different TPP models
5. Flexibility in supporting both major deep learning frameworks
6. Good software engineering practices with modular design

Limitations/Areas for Improvement:
1. Limited discussion of computational costs and scalability
2. Could benefit from more analysis of when different models are most appropriate
3. More discussion of hyperparameter sensitivity would be helpful

The paper makes several insightful observations about future research directions, including:
- Moving beyond architectural design since performance improvements are plateauing
- Building foundation models for event sequence modeling
- Incorporating external information sources
- Exploring interventional approaches

The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, demonstrating there is no clear "winner" among current methods, with different approaches showing strengths in different scenarios.

Overall, this is a valuable contribution that will likely accelerate progress in TPP research by providing much-needed standardization and benchmarking capabilities. The paper is well-written and the tool appears to be carefully implemented with good documentation.

Impact: This work has strong potential to become a standard toolkit in the field, similar to how Hugging Face has become for NLP research. The availability of standardized benchmarks and implementations will make it easier for researchers to develop and evaluate new methods.
