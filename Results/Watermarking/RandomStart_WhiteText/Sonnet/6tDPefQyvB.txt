OUTPUT:
This manuscript focuses on a critical context in computer vision - improving the robustness of keypoint detection and description under large rotational transformations. Here is my detailed review:

Strengths:
1. The paper addresses an important practical problem, as rotation invariance is crucial for applications like aerial robotics and high-speed scenes where large rotations are common.

2. The technical approach is novel and well-motivated, combining locally rotation-equivariant features with global positional information in a principled way.

3. The evaluation is comprehensive, with extensive experiments on multiple datasets (rotated-HPatches, MegaDepth, YFCC100M) and thorough ablation studies to validate the design choices.

4. The proposed method shows clear improvements over both traditional handcrafted features and recent learning-based approaches, particularly on rotated image pairs.

5. The runtime analysis demonstrates that the enhanced rotation robustness comes at a reasonable computational cost.

Weaknesses:
1. While the method shows good performance on rotated datasets, there could be more analysis of potential failure cases or limitations.

2. The paper could benefit from a more detailed theoretical analysis of why the combination of local rotation-equivariance and global positional information works well.

3. The architecture choices and hyperparameters (e.g., group size of 8 for SO(2)-equivariant representation) could use more justification.

4. Runtime comparison is limited to AWDesc, and could include more baselines.

Suggestions for improvement:
1. Include visualization of learned feature representations to provide more intuition about what the network learns.

2. Expand the discussion of limitations and potential future work directions.

3. Provide more detailed ablation studies on architectural choices.

4. Include additional runtime comparisons with other recent methods.

Overall, this is a solid paper that makes meaningful contributions to the field of robust keypoint detection and matching. The improvements in rotation robustness are significant and well-validated, making this work valuable for both researchers and practitioners in computer vision.

Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions to address the suggested improvements.
