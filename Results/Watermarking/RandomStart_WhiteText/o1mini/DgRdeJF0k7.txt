**Review of "MASKED DUAL-TEMPORAL AUTOENCODERS FOR SEMI-SUPERVISED TIME-SERIES CLASSIFICATION"**

The manuscript focuses on an important topic within the machine learning community: the application of masked dual-temporal autoencoders for semi-supervised time-series classification. With time-series data becoming increasingly prevalent in various domains, the need for effective classification methods that can leverage both labeled and unlabeled data is paramount. This paper presents a novel framework, referred to as masked dual-temporal autoencoders (MDTA), aiming to improve the classification performance through innovative mechanisms targeted at capturing temporal patterns and semantic information from time-series data.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Contribution**: The claim that MDTA is the first masked time-series modeling framework for semi-supervised classification marks a significant innovation in the field. The authors have identified and addressed key limitations of existing models, particularly regarding the sensitivity to masking ratios and the inability to process diverse temporal resolutions effectively.

2. **Technical Soundness**: The proposed architecture includes a dual-temporal encoder designed to handle varying temporal resolutions and a relation-preserving loss function to maintain information integrity across sub-encoders. These technical choices are well-supported and theoretically grounded in existing literature.

3. **Empirical Validation**: The authors conduct extensive experiments across multiple datasets, comparing MDTA against seven baseline methods and presenting a thorough statistical analysis of performance improvements. The reporting of results across various label ratios and datasets adds robustness to the findings.

4. **Ablation Studies**: The inclusion of ablation studies providing insights into the contributions of different components of the method (e.g., the dual-temporal encoder and relation-preserving loss) strengthens the argument for the proposed framework’s effectiveness.

5. **Practical Relevance**: The study has high practical relevance, considering the scarcity of labeled data in real-world applications. The framework seeks to address the universality of time-series labels, making it a timely contribution.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity and Efficiency**: While the methodology is sophisticated, the paper admits that MDTA has higher computational inefficiency compared to other baselines due to two sequential sub-encoders. More discussion on potential strategies for improving computational efficiency without sacrificing performance would be beneficial.

2. **Comparison with State-of-the-Art**: While MDTA outperforms existing methods in many scenarios, some datasets still show lower performance than certain baselines. A more in-depth analysis explaining why specific baselines outperform MDTA on certain datasets would be advantageous.

3. **Generality Beyond Univariate Data**: The authors claim that the method can be extended to multivariate time series, but the experimental results and performance comparisons are predominantly focused on univariate datasets. Including multivariate scenarios in the main results would strengthen the claims of generality.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**: The paper primarily uses accuracy as the evaluation metric. Although accuracy is important, additional metrics such as F1-score, precision, and recall, especially in imbalanced datasets, should be considered to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model’s performance.

5. **Visualizations**: While the paper includes some visualizations of data spaces, more clarity on how these visualizations directly relate to classification performance improvements would enhance understanding. For instance, including visualizations of how the relation-preserving mechanism affects clustering in latent spaces could be insightful.

**Conclusion**:
Overall, the manuscript presents an innovative approach to an important problem in semi-supervised time-series classification. The technical contributions and empirical validation are strong, and the results broadly support the effectiveness of the proposed framework. With some enhancements regarding computational efficiency, a more nuanced analysis of performance discrepancies, and broader evaluations beyond univariate data, this paper could make a significant impact on the field. I recommend acceptance, subject to minor revisions addressing the aforementioned points.
