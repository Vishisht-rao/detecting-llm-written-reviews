**Review of "Encoding Expert Knowledge into Federated Learning Using Weak Supervision"**

**Summary:**
The paper proposes a novel method named Weak Supervision Heuristics for Federated Learning (WSHFL), which aims to integrate expert knowledge into federated learning (FL) frameworks by utilizing programmatic weak supervision through labeling functions (LFs). This approach addresses the challenges of training models on sensitive and distributed on-device data, where expert annotations are often scarce or impossible to obtain. The authors conduct experiments across two data modalities—text (sentiment analysis) and time-series (arrhythmia detection)—and claim that WSHFL achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised baselines without the need for direct data annotations.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Approach:** The paper introduces the integration of programmatic weak supervision into federated learning, which is a relatively unexplored area. This is particularly significant considering the growing demand for training models on sensitive and decentralized data sources.
  
2. **Practical Relevance:** The problem of acquiring expert annotations in sensitive domains such as healthcare and mobile applications is timely and relevant. The method proposed has the potential to make machine learning applications more feasible in these areas.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The authors conduct trials on diverse datasets and data modalities, demonstrating the applicability and performance of WSHFL across different settings. The experimental results indicate that WSHFL is effective in mining high-accuracy and high-coverage LFs.

4. **Clear Methodology:** The paper presents a clear and structured explanation of the WSHFL algorithm, including the mining of LFs and their subsequent use in training a PWS model. The use of figures and algorithms enhances the readability of the methodology.

5. **Discussion of Challenges:** The authors insightfully discuss the challenges of implementing weak supervision in a federated context, indicating their awareness of the nuances intrinsic to their approach.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limits of expert feedback:** While the paper claims to encode expert supervision, the reliance on an oracle for feedback raises questions about the realism of the experimental setup. It would be beneficial to investigate how WSHFL performs with actual experts whose feedback may be more varied and less certain.

2. **Depth of Analysis:** Although the paper successfully demonstrates the efficacy of WSHFL compared to several baselines, a deeper exploration of why WSHFL performs better than the naive greedy baseline or ablation studies focusing on individual components of the method would strengthen the argument for its contributions.

3. **Societal Impact Considerations:** The paper briefly addresses potential privacy concerns associated with federated learning but could provide a more robust discussion on how the proposed approach mitigates risks associated with sensitive data.

4. **Generalizability:** The scope of the experiments is limited to specific datasets; thus, the generalizability of the findings remains to be shown. Future work could explore more diverse datasets and applications to validate the approach comprehensively.

5. **Comparative Analysis with State-of-the-Art:** The paper could improve its positioning by more effectively contextualizing WSHFL within the current state-of-the-art in federated learning and weak supervision.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the fields of federated learning and weak supervision. It presents a well-structured and innovative approach to an important problem in machine learning. Enhancing the analysis and practical implications of the work, alongside exploring the robustness of WSHFL against real-world feedback, would further solidify its impact. I recommend this paper for acceptance, with minor revisions to address the points mentioned above.
