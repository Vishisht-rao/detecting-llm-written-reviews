OUTPUT:
This manuscript addresses the context of improving Equilibrium Propagation (EP) without strict weight symmetry through the introduction of a concept termed "Jacobian Homeostasis." It tackles a significant challenge in the application of EP and its relevance to biological and analog neuromorphic systems, making a case for its theoretical advances and empirical demonstrations. Below is an overview of the strengths, weaknesses, and overall assessment of the paper.

### Strengths:
1. **Theoretical Contributions**: The paper significantly advances the understanding of the sources of bias in gradient estimation in EP by explicitly distinguishing between the effects of weight asymmetry and finite nudges. The formulation that utilizes complex-differentiable non-symmetric networks to avoid biases via the Cauchy integral is innovative and could pave the way for more accurate gradient estimations in general.

2. **Holomorphic EP Extension**: The adaptation of holomorphic EP to non-symmetric dynamical systems is a crucial extension. It demonstrates the authors' competency in both theoretical development and practical implications for training algorithms.

3. **Practical Implementation**: The empirical results provided are comprehensive, showcasing the efficacy of the proposed homeostatic objective in improving performance on complex tasks such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 32x32. The ability to approach performance levels close to symmetric networks underlines the significance of this research.

4. **Clarity and Depth**: The manuscript is well-organized, leading the reader through the theoretical foundations, experimental settings, and results coherently. The use of illustrations and comparisons enhances clarity.

5. **Robustness to Asymmetry**: The exploration of training dynamics and the robustness against weight asymmetry in different architectures is essential for practical applications and could be a step towards biologically plausible training methods.

### Weaknesses:
1. **Biological Plausibility**: While the theoretical aspects are robust, the paper could expand more on the biological implications of its findings. The oscillation-based learning mechanism described poses questions about practical implementations in biological systems, which could be addressed to enhance the manuscript's appeal to a broader audience.

2. **Comparative Analysis with Existing Methods**: Although the manuscript briefly mentions other alternatives to EP and their limitations, a more detailed comparative analysis highlighting the advantages of the proposed approach could strengthen the manuscript’s position in the context of existing literature.

3. **Efficiency Concerns**: The authors present advancements in estimating gradients, but the computational cost associated with the proposed methods, especially in terms of hardware requirements and time efficiency, could be discussed. The trade-offs between accuracy and computational overhead may be critical for deployment on resource-limited neuromorphic hardware.

4. **Parameter Sensitivity**: The paper could benefit from a more thorough exploration of sensitivity variations in hyperparameters used in the experiments. It would be informative to understand how different settings impact both performance and stability.

### Overall Assessment:
This manuscript represents a meaningful contribution to the field of neural network training paradigms, specifically in the context of biological and neuromorphic computation. The introduction of Jacobian Homeostasis offers a promising direction for future research and highlights the potential for developing more efficient learning algorithms that retain the benefits of gradient-based learning without strict requirements for weight symmetry. 

While there are areas for improvement—particularly regarding biological relevance, comparative robustness, and computational efficiency—the foundational work presented here is compelling and arguably sets the stage for future explorations in the domain. Acceptance of this paper for the conference is recommended, with the condition that the authors address the suggested weaknesses to strengthen their argument further.
