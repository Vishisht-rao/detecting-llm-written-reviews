**Review of "MAPSELECT : SPARSE & INTERPRETABLE GRAPH ATTENTION NETWORKS"**

**Summary:**
This paper addresses the challenge of interpretability in Graph Attention Networks (GATs) by proposing a novel method named MapSelect. The authors introduce a sparse, controllable attention mechanism that aims to improve interpretability while maintaining model performance. The method incorporates two configurations: a local approach (MapSelect-L) that focuses on individual node neighborhoods and a global approach (MapSelect-G) that looks at the graph as a whole. Through comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, the authors demonstrate that MapSelect significantly outperforms several existing baselines in terms of both interpretability and task performance.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach**: The introduction of MapSelect as a fully differentiable sparse attention mechanism presents a significant contribution to the field, particularly in the context of GATs, where dense attention has been criticized for reducing interpretability.
   
2. **Benchmarking and Comparison**: The paper provides a thorough evaluation of five sparse GAT models across various datasets, comparing them against a range of baseline methods. This rigorous benchmarking enhances the credibility of the proposed method.

3. **Trade-off Insights**: The authors establish insights into the trade-offs between sparsity, accuracy, and interpretability, which could guide future research in model design for GNNs.

4. **Application of SparseMAP**: The utilization of SparseMAP to enforce sparsity constraints in a manner that remains differentiable is a notable technical achievement that could be applied in various domains beyond graphs.

5. **Clear Figures and Illustrations**: The inclusion of visual aids (e.g., Figure 1 for the overview of MapSelect and results summary) supports the clarity of the proposed methods and findings.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Generalizability of Results**: While the authors provide convincing results on five datasets, it is essential to evaluate the method on more diverse datasets and tasks, including those outside standard node classification, to validate the generalizability of MapSelect.

2. **Complexity and Computational Efficiency**: The paper could benefit from a discussion surrounding the computational complexity associated with the implementation of MapSelect, particularly in comparison to existing methods. It would be valuable to understand how MapSelect scales with larger graphs or more complex tasks.

3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Although the authors control for hyperparameters in their experiments, it would be beneficial to investigate the sensitivity of MapSelect’s performance to different configurations, as this might impact replicability and practical deployment.

4. **Interpretability Metrics**: The paper relies primarily on fidelity and explanation entropy to measure interpretability. Expanding the evaluation metrics to include complementary methods or qualitative assessments could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of interpretability.

5. **Future Directions**: While the authors mention potential future improvements, such as exploring maximum spanning tree constraints, a more detailed roadmap for extending the capabilities of MapSelect would enhance the paper's contributions.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper presents a valuable advancement in the domain of interpretable graph neural networks by introducing MapSelect. The thorough evaluations and insights into sparsity-interpretability trade-offs make a significant contribution. Addressing the mentioned weaknesses could further bolster the work’s impact and applicability in various machine learning tasks. I recommend acceptance to the conference, contingent on addressing minor issues raised.
