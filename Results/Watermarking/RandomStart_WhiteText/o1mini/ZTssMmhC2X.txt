**Review of "How to Fine-Tune Vision Models with SGD"**

The study examines a critical topic in deep learning: the optimization of vision models during the fine-tuning phase using different optimizers, specifically focusing on Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and AdamW. The authors offer insights on the performance differences between these optimizers when fine-tuning vision models, particularly under distribution shiftsâ€”a commonly encountered scenario in real-world applications.

### Strengths:

1. **Relevance**: The paper addresses a timely issue given the increasing reliance on large pretrained models in various computer vision tasks. Fine-tuning such models effectively is essential for achieving optimal performance, especially when the data distribution changes.

2. **Rigorous Experimentation**: The authors conduct extensive experiments across several state-of-the-art vision architectures (including Vision Transformers and ConvNeXt) and datasets with different types of distribution shifts. The performance comparisons are well-presented and supported by comprehensive statistical analyses.

3. **Novel Insights**: The identification of the role of gradients in the embedding layer during fine-tuning provides a novel contribution to understanding optimizer performance. The freezing of the embedding layer as a simple yet effective modification to SGD is a key finding that offers practical implications for researchers and practitioners alike.

4. **Data Efficiency**: The paper emphasizes the memory efficiency of SGD in comparison to AdamW, making it appealing for environments with limited computational resources. The proposed methods achieve competitive performance with lower memory overhead, which is significant in training large models.

5. **State-of-the-Art Results**: By achieving new state-of-the-art performance on multiple popular distribution shift benchmarks, the study demonstrates the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Generalizability**: While the paper makes a strong case for its specific setting (fine-tuning on specific vision models and datasets), it would benefit from discussions on whether these findings translate to other domains, such as NLP or settings without a distinct embedding layer.

2. **Limited Exploration of Alternatives**: The paper lightly touches upon other optimizers like LARS and LAMB but does not delve deeply into their comparative performance. A more thorough exploration of additional optimizers that utilize layerwise normalization techniques could strengthen the insights presented.

3. **Potential Overfitting**: The authors present comparisons based on average performance across datasets, but it would be valuable to examine variability in performance more deeply, such as analyzing cases where SGD (freeze-embed) does not outperform AdamW. Are there specific scenarios when freezing the embedding does not yield competitive results?

4. **Analysis of Hyperparameters**: The study does well in establishing the importance of the freezing method but could enhance the analysis by exploring the sensitivity of results to hyperparameter settings, particularly for layer-wise learning rates and weight decay.

### Conclusion:

In summary, the paper makes an important contribution to the understanding of optimizer dynamics during fine-tuning of vision models. It presents compelling evidence in favor of freezing the embedding layer during SGD fine-tuning, backed by rigorous experimentation across various modern architectures and benchmarks. While certain aspects could be explored further, the insights offered are timely, practical, and of great relevance to both the academic community and the industry professionals working with large-scale vision models. The paper is recommended for acceptance with the anticipation that the authors consider addressing the mentioned weaknesses for improved clarity and generalizability.
