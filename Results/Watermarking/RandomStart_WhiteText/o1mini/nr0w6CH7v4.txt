**Review of "Quality Diversity Through Human Feedback"**

This manuscript addresses the problem of enhancing quality diversity (QD) algorithms by incorporating human feedback into their optimization processes, presenting a novel framework termed Quality Diversity through Human Feedback (QDHF). The authors suggest that while reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has shown potential in optimizing models based on averaged human preferences, it does not adequately support tasks requiring diverse responses. As a solution, QDHF dynamically infers diversity metrics based on human judgments of similarity among solutions, which they argue enhances exploration and improves the diversity of generated outcomes in complex, open-ended tasks.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach**: The introduction of QDHF is a significant contribution to the field of quality diversity optimization. By leveraging human feedback to derive diversity metrics, the authors provide a compelling alternative to traditional QD algorithms that rely on manually crafted metrics.

2. **Empirical Validation**: The authors present a comprehensive set of empirical studies across various tasks in robotics and reinforcement learning. The results demonstrate that QDHF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in automatic diversity discovery and achieves performance similar to QD methods using manually crafted metrics.

3. **User Studies**: The inclusion of user studies, particularly in the latent space illumination task, adds qualitative support to the findings. The positive feedback regarding the diversity of images generated using QDHF suggests that the approach aligns well with human intuitions about diversity and quality.

4. **Scalability Analysis**: The paper provides a thoughtful exploration of the scalability of the QDHF framework, emphasizing that it can leverage preference models and does not rely solely on human labelers. This aspect is valuable for real-world applications.

5. **Clear Structure and Presentation**: The manuscript is well-organized, with a clear introduction, method section, and results discussion. The graphics and figures effectively illustrate the concepts discussed.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Comparative Analysis**: While the authors compare QDHF to other methods, more detailed discussions on the limitations of existing methods and potential pitfalls of using human feedback as a diversity metric could strengthen the submission. A clear delineation of the contexts where QDHF likely outperforms traditional methods would also be beneficial.

2. **Parameter Sensitivity**: The paper touched upon scalability and the importance of human feedback sample size. However, it may be worthwhile to explore how sensitive the QDHF performance is to parameters, like the margin in the triplet loss or the configuration of the contrastive learning component.

3. **Impact of Latent Space Dimensionality**: The authors suggest that the dimensionality of the latent space can greatly influence performance. A discussion of how to select appropriate dimensionality for various tasks would provide practical insights for researchers attempting to implement this framework.

4. **Generalization to Other Domains**: While the experiments are robust, testing in more diverse and real-world scenarios could provide further evidence of generalizability. It would be useful to know how well QDHF scales to more complex tasks outside the tested domains.

5. **Human Feedback Acquisition**: While the manuscript mentions alternative methods to acquire human-like feedback using models like DreamSim, a discussion on the potential biases this could introduce would be relevant. How do the authors ensure that the models used to simulate human feedback are representative?

**Overall Impression:**

The paper presents a promising and innovative approach to quality diversity optimization that successfully integrates human feedback to enhance the capabilities of QD algorithms. The empirical evidence supports the methodology, and the user studies affirm the approach's alignment with human preferences. Despite some areas for improvement in comparative and scalability discussions, the work is well-justified, and the contributions are substantial, making it a strong candidate for acceptance at ICLR 2024. 

**Recommendation**: Accept with minor revisions. Address the weaknesses noted above for clarity and depth of understanding.
