OUTPUT:
The paper focuses on the key problem of extracting and defining generalizable interaction primitives from deep neural networks (DNNs) to enhance explainability in AI. The proposal addresses the crucial issue of summarizing knowledge encoded within DNNs into interpretable symbolic patterns, making it accessible for human cognition and fostering trust in AI systems.

### Strengths:
1. **Novel Contribution**: The approach presented is significant as it aims to establish a theoretical foundation for defining generalizable interaction primitives that can be shared across different DNNs trained on the same task. This is a substantial improvement over existing methods, which often struggle with generalization and faithfulness in the extraction of interactions.

2. **Theoretical Backing**: The paper builds on previous work (citing Ren et al., 2024) that has provided mathematical proofs for why certain interactions can be considered primitives of DNN inference. The incorporation of these theoretical perspectives gives the paper solid credibility and depth.

3. **Methodological Rigor**: The proposed method is well-outlined, including a clear mechanism to tackle the generalization problem. The authors introduce a row-wise maximum operation on interaction matrices, ensuring that the most salient interactions from multiple models can be extracted in a way that captures common knowledge.

4. **Empirical Validation**: The experiments conducted across various datasets show that the proposed method outperforms traditional extraction techniques in terms of sparsity and generalization power. The results convincingly indicate that interactions shared across different models provide a more reliable basis for understanding DNN outputs.

5. **Visualizations and Clarity**: Figures illustrating the distinctive and shared interactions and their strengths enhance comprehension. The paper provides substantial visual evidence showing the success of the method in extracting shared patterns across DNN architectures.

### Weaknesses:
1. **Complexity and Implementation**: While the paper mentions a practical approach to interaction extraction, the real-world applicability of the proposed method may be impeded by the complexity and computational cost associated with generating the necessary masked samples. Average run-times reported (45.14 seconds per sample for BERT) raise concerns about efficiency, especially for large-scale applications.

2. **Ablation Studies and Parameter Sensitivity**: Although the paper discusses the ablation study on the parameter α in Equation (6), further investigation into how the choice of α influences performance would have been beneficial. The sensitivity of results to this parameter could affect the consistency and reproducibility of the findings.

3. **Potential Overfitting**: The emphasis on extracting shared interactions raises concerns about potential overfitting to specific datasets. The paper could delve deeper into how the method performs across a broader range of tasks and datasets outside those tested.

4. **Theoretical Assumptions**: The reliance on certain assumptions for the universal matching theorem, such as the high-order derivatives of the DNN outputs being zero, may limit the generalizability of the findings. A discussion on the potential implications of relaxing these assumptions could enrich the theoretical framework.

### Overall Assessment:
This paper presents a compelling argument for improving the extraction of explainable interaction primitives from DNNs, contributing significantly to the field of explainable AI. The proposed methodology, underpinned by solid theoretical and empirical validations, offers a promising avenue for further research and application. Future work should focus on optimizing computational efficiency, exploring robustness across various domains, and refining the theoretical underpinnings to make the method more universally applicable.
