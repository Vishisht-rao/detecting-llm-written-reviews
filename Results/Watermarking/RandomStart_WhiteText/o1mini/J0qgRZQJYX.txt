**Review of "An Axiomatic Approach to Model-Agnostic Concept Explanations"**

This study focuses on the problem of providing model-agnostic concept explanations in machine learning, emphasizing the limitations of existing methods that are often model-specific. The authors propose a novel axiomatic framework that satisfies three key axioms: linearity, recursivity, and similarity, to define measures that quantify the influence of concepts on model predictions. Importantly, the paper connects these new measures with established methods, enhancing understanding of their semantic meanings within the context of concept explanations.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Contribution:**
   The introduction of an axiomatic approach to concept explanations is a significant advance. By grounding the proposed measures in clear axioms, the authors provide a solid theoretical foundation that addresses the common limitations of existing methods focused on specific models. 

2. **Model-Agnostic Approach:**
   One of the most compelling aspects is the model-agnostic nature of the proposed measures, which opens the door for wider applicability across various machine learning frameworks. This is especially beneficial in scenarios involving proprietary models where inner workings cannot be inspected.

3. **Comprehensive Experimental Validation:**
   The experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed measures in various contexts, including model selection, optimizer selection, and model improvement through prompt editing. The outcomes effectively demonstrate the practical applicability of the theory and promise for enhancing model interpretability and performance.

4. **Connections to Prior Research:**
   By linking the new measures to existing methodologies such as TCAV and completeness-aware explanations, the paper provides important context for readers and positions the new approach within the current literature. This acknowledgment of related work is crucial for situating the contribution and for future research directions.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity and Clarity:**
   While the theoretical framework is well-articulated, certain sections could benefit from clearer exposition. For instance, the proofs provided in the appendix, while rigorously formal, may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with advanced mathematical concepts. Simplifying the explanations or providing more intuitive illustrations could enhance accessibility.

2. **Experimental Scope:**
   Although the experiments covered a range of applications, it would be beneficial for the authors to include more diverse datasets and models to better illustrate the robustness of their approach. For example, demonstrating the effectiveness on real-world applications beyond standard benchmarks could reinforce the practical implications of the work.

3. **Discussion of Limitations:**
   The authors mention that their method relies on annotated examples for concept relevance detection. An exploration of how the approach can be adapted or function in scenarios without such annotations would add depth to the discussion and broaden its applicability.

4. **Further Research Directions:**
   While the authors outline future directions, it would be advantageous to elaborate further on how these could be operationalized. For example, what specific methodologies might be employed for efficient concept learning and discovery?

**Conclusion:**

Overall, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of interpretable machine learning by providing an innovative axiomatic framework for model-agnostic concept explanations. The theoretical foundation is solid, and the experimental validation supports the proposed approach. With some modifications to enhance clarity and broaden the experimental scope, this work has the potential to be a significant resource for researchers and practitioners alike in the explainable AI community.
