**Review of "Model Selection of Anomaly Detectors in the Absence of Labeled Validation Data"**

The study examines an important context within the field of anomaly detection, particularly focusing on the challenges posed by the absence of labeled validation data. The authors propose a novel framework that employs generative models, specifically diffusion models, to synthesize anomalies for model selection purposes. This approach could be a significant step forward in enabling more reliable evaluation and selection of models in practical scenarios where labeled data is scarce. 

### Strengths:

1. **Relevance and Novelty**: The problem addressed is highly relevant as it reflects a common challenge faced by practitioners in deploying anomaly detection systems. The proposed solution of using synthesized anomalies to perform model selection without requiring labeled data is innovative and fills a much-needed gap in current methodologies.

2. **Framework Clarity**: The authors clearly delineate their approach in multiple steps, from creating a synthetic validation dataset using a small support set of normal samples to evaluating candidate models based on the synthesized anomalies. This structured methodology is easy to follow and implement.

3. **Use of Diffusion Models**: Leveraging diffusion models for generating anomalies is a modern and appropriate choice, given their recent successes in generating high-quality images. The authors' assertion that their method requires no training or fine-tuning adds practical value, making the process accessible for various applications.

4. **Extensive Empirical Study**: The empirical evaluations conducted on diverse datasets (MVTec-AD, CUB, and Flowers) strengthen the validity of the approach. The results showing high correlation between model rankings based on synthetic vs. real validation data enhance the credibility of the proposed framework.

5. **Performance on CLIP Prompt Selection**: The compelling results achieved in selecting prompts for CLIP-based anomaly detection demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of the synthetic anomalies generated by the proposed framework.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Limited Generalization on MVTec-AD**: While the approach shows promise across various datasets, the performance on the MVTec-AD dataset appears to be less effective, particularly in approximating real validation performance. The authors could provide further insights or potential pathways for improvement in future work, especially considering the variety of anomaly types present in such datasets.

2. **Potential for Overfitting**: By relying on a limited support set to generate anomalies, there is a risk of overfitting the models to the specific characteristics of the synthetic anomalies, which may not generalize well to real-world scenarios. A discussion on the limitations and potential risks of this synthetic approach is warranted.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**: The sole reliance on AUROC for evaluating the model selection process might not encapsulate all performance aspects. Incorporating additional metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score) could provide a more nuanced understanding of model efficacy, particularly in real-world applications where anomalies can vary significantly in consequence.

4. **Discussions on Computational Complexity**: While the method specifies that no training is required, the document does not extensively address the computational costs associated with generating synthetic anomalies and evaluating models, which may still be significant in practice.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
- Consider providing a deeper analysis of the shortcomings observed in the MVTec-AD dataset and potential strategies to mitigate these issues or adapt the framework for better performance.
- Expand on the computational complexities associated with generating anomalies and model evaluations in practice; this will help practitioners gauge the operational feasibility of the proposed methods.
- Discuss the implications of potential overfitting when utilizing a small support set for anomaly generation and consider strategies to validate against this risk.

### Conclusion:
Overall, the paper presents a highly relevant and innovative approach to model selection in anomaly detection using synthetic data, with a strong empirical foundation. Despite some limitations, the contributions within this work could significantly impact the field, particularly in situations where labeled data is scarce. With refinements and further exploration of generalizability, this methodology could become a valuable tool for practitioners in anomaly detection across various domains.
