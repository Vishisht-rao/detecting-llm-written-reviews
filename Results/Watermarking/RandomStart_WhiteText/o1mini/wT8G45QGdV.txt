**Review of "CONSISTENT 123: IMPROVE CONSISTENCY FOR ONE IMAGE TO 3D OBJECT SYNTHESIS"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents Consistent123, a novel approach to improving view consistency in 3D object synthesis using large image diffusion models. The authors identify the lack of view consistency in existing diffusion models for image-to-3D translation as a significant limitation impacting performance in downstream tasks such as 3D reconstruction. They propose enhancements to the model architecture, specifically through the introduction of cross-view attention layers and shared self-attention mechanisms, to facilitate improved interactions between synthesized views. Additionally, a progressive classifier-free guidance strategy is introduced to balance texture and geometry quality in the synthesized views. Experimental results indicate that Consistent123 outperforms previous models, such as Zero123, both qualitatively and quantitatively, across multiple benchmarks.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Architecture:** The introduction of cross-view attention layers alongside shared self-attention is a notable improvement that facilitates more robust inter-view interactions, which is critical for achieving consistency in 3D reconstructions.
   
2. **Experimental Validation:** The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method against several baselines. The quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS) demonstrate significant improvements in view consistency and quality with Consistent123.

3. **Diverse Downstream Applications:** By showing improvements across various tasks, including 3D reconstruction and image-to-3D generation, the authors highlight the versatility of their approach and its implications for future research.

4. **Clear Methodology:** The step-by-step explanation of model components and training strategies, including ablation studies, provides clarity on how each aspect of the model contributes to the overall performance.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Discourse on Computational Efficiency:** While the authors mention the potential for arbitrary view sampling and reduced overfitting through shared attention, the computational implications of these improvements are not discussed in detail. Given that diffusion models can be resource-intensive, exploring the efficiency of the training and inference processes would strengthen the contribution.

2. **Ablation Study Depth:** The ablation studies primarily focus on the removal of significant components. A deeper investigation into how different configurations or variations of the proposed attention mechanisms affect performance could provide more insight into their effectiveness.

3. **Generalization Insights:** Although the authors claim that Consistent123 generalizes across various downstream tasks, a more rigorous examination of generalization to unseen object categories beyond the datasets used could further solidify the applicability of their model in real-world scenarios.

4. **Failure Cases:** The inclusion of detailed failure case analyses could provide a more balanced perspective on model limitations. Understanding where models like Consistent123 struggle would be beneficial for guiding future research efforts.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, "CONSISTENT 123: IMPROVE CONSISTENCY FOR ONE IMAGE TO 3D OBJECT SYNTHESIS" presents a valuable contribution to the field of 3D object generation. The proposed model demonstrates a significant advancement in achieving view consistency, which is essential for practical applications in 3D reconstruction and beyond. Despite minor weaknesses regarding computational efficiency and the depth of analysis in ablation studies, the research addresses a critical context within the realm of image-to-3D synthesis and sets a strong foundation for future investigations. I recommend acceptance for presentation at ICLR 2024, with encouragement for the authors to address the aforementioned weaknesses in their final version.
