### Review of "TOWARDS FAITHFUL EXPLANATIONS: BOOSTING RATIONALIZATION WITH SHORTCUTS DISCOVERY"

The research investigates a critical context in machine learning—explainability—by introducing a novel method called Shortcuts-fused Selective Rationalization (SSR) aimed at improving the rationalization of neural networks in natural language tasks. The study convincingly highlights that current selective rationalization methods often leverage shortcuts in the data, which can lead to misleading explanations that do not align with human judgment. By addressing these shortcomings and proposing a framework that incorporates shortcuts more effectively, the authors contribute to a pressing need for more interpretable AI models.

#### Strengths:

1. **Importance of Issue**: The authors tackle the pertinent challenge of interpretability in deep learning models, particularly highlighting the role of shortcuts in compromising the quality of rationales derived from neural networks.

2. **Innovative Approach**: The SSR method introduces a dual-phase training strategy, which involves discovering potential shortcuts and incorporating them thoughtfully into the rationale extraction process. This approach appears well-grounded in the assumptions made and the theoretical framework presented.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The authors present extensive experiments across multiple datasets from the ERASER benchmark, providing robust evidence for the effectiveness of SSR compared to both unsupervised and supervised methods. The use of various performance metrics (task and token-level F1 scores) allows for a nuanced evaluation of the model's capabilities.

4. **Detailed Ablation Studies**: The thorough ablation studies provided in the paper help to elucidate the contributions of various components of the SSR framework, reinforcing the necessity of shared parameters and the introduction of the uniformization constraint in improving model performance.

5. **Potential for Generalization**: The findings suggest that SSR can generalize well to out-of-distribution scenarios, showcasing resilience in the model's predictions. This is particularly valuable as it hints at the model's applicability beyond the training datasets.

#### Weaknesses:

1. **Clarity and Conciseness**: While the paper is methodical in its exposition, certain sections could be more concise to improve clarity. For instance, some of the technical explanations, especially in the methodology sections, could be summarized without losing essential detail.

2. **Human Evaluation**: Although human evaluation is included, the criteria and scoring methods could benefit from a clearer explanation of how raters were chosen and whether they had varying levels of expertise. This could strengthen claims regarding the qualitative improvements in rationales.

3. **Comparison to State-of-the-art**: While the results presented indicate that SSR competes favorably against state-of-the-art methods like AT-BMC, it would be beneficial to include direct quantitative comparisons with other recent models in the literature that were not considered baseline methods, along with a discussion of how they inspired or relate to SSR. 

4. **Limitations and Future Work**: The paper could have been enhanced by discussing the potential limitations of SSR more explicitly. For instance, the reliance on discovering shortcuts through an unsupervised model could be examined for potential biases in shortcut identification. Additionally, suggestions for future work could be more detailed, particularly regarding the application of SSR to real-world scenarios beyond benchmarks.

#### Conclusion:

Overall, the paper presents a significant advance in the field of interpretable machine learning. The proposed SSR method is innovative and the experimental results are compelling, demonstrating that it addresses the critical issues of shortcut exploitation in rationalization. By successfully merging theory and application, the authors have laid a solid foundation for further exploration into accountable and interpretable AI systems. With some improvements in clarity, discussion of limitations, and expanded comparisons to contemporary work, this research could have an even broader impact in the community. I recommend acceptance for presentation at ICLR 2024.
