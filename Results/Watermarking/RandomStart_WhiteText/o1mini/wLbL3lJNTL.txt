**Review of "Joint Representations for Reinforcement Learning with Multiple Sensors"**

**Summary:**
The research investigates the aspect of leveraging multiple sensor modalities, specifically images and proprioception, to enhance representation learning in reinforcement learning (RL) settings. The authors propose a novel approach that combines reconstruction-based and contrastive losses to effectively process heterogeneous sensor inputs. By using Recurrent State Space Models (RSSMs), they aim to create joint representations that yield superior performance compared to traditional methods—such as concatenating image representations with proprioceptive data. The experimental evaluations across diverse tasks demonstrate significant improvements in RL performance, especially in challenging settings with complex environments like distractions and occlusions.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Contribution:** The paper addresses a critical gap in the current RL landscape—utilizing multiple sensor modalities holistically rather than in isolation. The approach of integrating proprioceptive information into the representation learning process is a valuable addition to the field.
   
2. **Robust Methodology:** The proposed combination of reconstruction and contrastive learning objectives is well-justified and carefully evaluated. The systematic analysis of different representation learning paradigms using RSSMs is a strong point, providing a comprehensive understanding of how various losses impact both model-free and model-based RL.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The authors conduct extensive experiments on a variety of tasks, including the DeepMind Control Suite and novel locomotion tasks. This broad evaluation strengthens the validity of their claims about improved performance across complex scenarios, particularly in the presence of noise and distractions.

4. **Clear Presentation of Results:** The results are well-presented, with detailed performance profiles and comparisons against state-of-the-art methods. The use of confidence intervals and performance summaries aids in understanding the reliability of the findings.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Lack of Comparison Against More Baselines:** While the paper includes several contemporary methods for comparison, it could benefit from additional baselines, especially those that employ state-of-the-art contrastive learning techniques outside of the RL framework, to provide a clearer picture of relative performance.

2. **Theoretical Justification:** While the empirical results are compelling, a deeper theoretical exploration of why combining reconstruction and contrastive losses works well in certain contexts and fails in others could enhance the work. Clarifying the scenarios where each loss is beneficial would be helpful for practitioners.

3. **Limitations and Future Directions:** Although the authors mention the limitations in the conclusion, the discussion could be expanded. Insights into how the findings could influence future research directions in multimodal RL or potential applications in practical robotics would enrich the narrative.

4. **Complexity and Scalability:** The paper does not discuss the computational efficiency or scalability of the proposed methods in depth. Understanding computational requirements and potential trade-offs is crucial, especially for real-time applications.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper presents a significant advancement in the domain of reinforcement learning through the innovative fusion of multi-sensor representations. The results indicate practical applicability and potential future exploration paths, making it a valuable contribution to the field. Addressing the highlighted weaknesses could enhance its impact further, but the foundational work and findings are solid and commendable. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions focusing on the theoretical underpinnings and expanded discussion on scalability and complexity.
