### Review of "Amicable Perturbations"

This article addresses a critical area in the application of machine learning (ML) classifiers, specifically focusing on undesirable classifications and how actionable changes in the real world can improve these classifications. The authors propose a new framework termed "amicable perturbations," which aims to provide advice on realistic changes that can enhance the chances of achieving favorable outcomes, differentiating this approach from both counterfactual explanations and adversarial attacks.

#### Key Contributions
1. **Conceptual Novelty**: The introduction of amicable perturbations as a means to find efficient real-world actions to alter undesirable classifications is a significant contribution. The paper effectively highlights the limitations of existing methods, such as counterfactuals, that often do not provide actionable or realistic advice, and adversarial attacks that merely manipulate data.

2. **Framework Development**: The authors present a comprehensive framework that includes actionable sets, cost measures, target sets, and statistical distance measures, providing a structured method for generating amicable perturbations.

3. **Verification Method**: The introduction of a novel verification procedure to ensure that amicable perturbations genuinely affect true class probabilities rather than merely fooling the classifier is a noteworthy advancement. This addresses a common criticism of both adversarial and counterfactual methods.

4. **Empirical Validation**: The paper includes extensive empirical results across multiple datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of amicable perturbations compared to traditional methods. The results are convincingly presented and support the claims made in the methodology.

#### Strengths
- **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is well-structured, with a logical flow from the introduction to the details of the framework, followed by empirical validation. This makes it accessible to readers from diverse backgrounds in machine learning and statistics.
  
- **Thorough Comparisons**: The comparison of amicable perturbations with counterfactuals and adversarial examples is thorough and well-articulated, providing a clear understanding of the benefits and unique aspects of the proposed method.

- **Applicability**: The framework is shown to have broad applicability across different domains, such as healthcare, finance, and education, making it an important contribution to the field.

#### Weaknesses
- **Complexity of Implementation**: While the theoretical framework is well-presented, the complexity involved in implementing the actionability and coherence constraints may pose a practical challenge. Guidance on how to tackle these complexities in real-world scenarios could enhance usability.

- **Generalization Concerns**: The paper could benefit from a discussion on the generalizability of amicable perturbations to new, unseen data distributions. While the results are promising, it remains to be seen how robust these perturbations are outside the tested datasets.

- **Limited Exploration of Causality**: The authors mention potential future work on incorporating causal relationships into their framework, which is a critical aspect to improve the reliability of the suggestions made by amicable perturbations. Expanding on this in the current work could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the changes suggested.

#### Suggestions for Improvement
1. **Implementation Guidelines**: Providing a clearer pathway or step-by-step approach for implementing amicable perturbations in practice could be beneficial for practitioners.

2. **Broader Dataset Evaluation**: Testing the framework on a wider variety of datasets, including more varied distributions and conditions, could help validate the framework's robustness.

3. **Integration of Causal Models**: Further exploration of integrating causal relationships into the framework could enhance the practical implications of amicable perturbations.

#### Conclusion
Overall, this paper presents an innovative approach that addresses a significant gap in the field of machine learning, offering practical solutions for users facing undesirable classifications. The groundwork laid by the authors offers the potential for valuable future research and applications. The proposal of amicable perturbations marks a noteworthy step forward in providing actionable insights into improving classification outcomes through realistic changes. I recommend the acceptance of this paper with minor revisions focusing on the points discussed above.
