OUTPUT:
The manuscript investigates an important issue in multi-modal machine learning, specifically the challenge of test-time adaptation (TTA) under conditions of reliability bias. This bias arises when different modalities (e.g., visual and audio) experience distinct distribution shifts, leading to information discrepancies that complicate effective multi-modal fusion and ultimately degrade performance. 

### Strengths:
1. **Novel Contribution**: The authors introduce the concept of "reliability bias," which is a significant advancement in understanding the dynamics of multi-modal TTA, and propose a methodology—RELiable fusion and robust ADaptation (READ)—to address this challenge. This is a timely addition to the literature, given the increasing reliance on multi-modal systems in various applications.

2. **Innovative Approach**: The READ methodology includes two key innovations: 
   - Self-adaptive attention-based fusion that dynamically modulates the attention between modalities according to their reliability. 
   - A novel conﬁdence-aware objective function that amplifies the contributions of confident predictions while mitigating the effects of noisy predictions. This paradigm shift is particularly valuable as it moves away from conventional reliance on normalization layers, which have limitations in multi-modal contexts.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluations**: The authors provide extensive empirical validation through well-structured benchmarks (Kinetics50-C and VGGSound-C) and demonstrate the superiority of READ over existing state-of-the-art methods across various noise conditions. The inclusion of results across different modalities and severities strengthens the paper.

4. **Clear Presentation**: The manuscript is well-organized and clearly addresses the research questions. The figures and tables effectively illustrate the results and the proposed approach, making the complex concepts more understandable.

### Weaknesses:
1. **Limited Range of Modalities**: While the benchmarks include audio and video, additional modalities (such as text or sensor data) could be incorporated in future work to generalize the findings further. This would provide more insights into the performance of READ in more complex multi-modal scenarios.

2. **Theoretical Underpinnings**: Although the authors provide empirical validation for their approach, a more thorough theoretical discussion regarding the behavior of their conﬁdence-aware loss function, primarily the rationale behind its design and expected advantages over traditional loss functions, could strengthen the manuscript. 

3. **Computational Complexity**: The manuscript discusses efficiency and compares READ's GPU time with other methods. However, a more comprehensive analysis of computational complexity in relation to scalability and deployment in real-world scenarios would be beneficial.

### Conclusion:
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of multi-modal TTA by not only identifying a critical challenge—reliability bias—but also offering a viable and innovative solution. The proposed methods are well-supported by experiments, showing promising results that surpass existing benchmarks. The authors should consider addressing the highlighted areas for improvement, which would enhance the robustness and applicability of their findings. I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it paves the way for future research addressing multi-modal adaptation challenges.
