**Review of the paper "SimTeG: A Frustratingly Simple Approach Improves Textual Graph Learning"**

This paper investigates an important aspect of the burgeoning field of representation learning for Textual Graphs (TGs) by proposing a simple yet effective method called SimTeG. The authors focus on enhancing the state of textual embeddings, which has traditionally relied on engineering-heavy methods, and suggest that improving these embeddings can lead to increased performance in downstream Graph Neural Network (GNN) tasks. The method is evaluated primarily on node classification and link prediction tasks using three popular benchmark datasets—OGBN-Arxiv, OGBN-Products, and OGBL-Citation2—showing competitive results compared to complex GNN architectures.

**Strengths:**

1. **Clear Contribution**: The paper clearly elucidates its contribution of enhancing textual embeddings to improve GNN performance without necessitating complex architectures. This addresses a significant gap in existing literature, where traditional feature extraction methods often limit GNN capabilities.

2. **Empirical Results**: The authors present extensive experiments demonstrating that their approach, SimTeG, consistently outperforms established baselines and complex GNN models, suggesting robustness and scalability of the methodology. Notably, achieving state-of-the-art performance on OGBN-Arxiv with a simple two-layer GraphSAGE architecture is noteworthy.

3. **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**: The empirical findings regarding the utility of PEFT for fine-tuning language models (LMs) are insightful, demonstrating that it can alleviate overfitting issues while retaining the modeling power of LMs.

4. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The paper not only evaluates SimTeG on multiple datasets but also provides ablation studies and sensitivity analyses regarding the choice of LMs, which enrich the understanding of the method's performance.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity in Interpretability**: While the method is termed "frustratingly simple," the paper may benefit from a more detailed discussion on the implications of using advanced text features. Specifically, while improvements in performance are shown, the relationship between text quality and GNN efficacy could be unpacked further.

2. **Limited Discussion on Limitations**: Although there is mention of performance variability depending on the dataset, a more profound exploration of why certain datasets show less improvement with the method would strengthen the paper. For instance, the text attributes of OGBN-Products did not leverage the LMs to the same extent as OGBN-Arxiv.

3. **Impact of Supporting Text**: The augmentation of node representations with supporting text from LLMs raises questions around the scalability and generalizability of the method. How this impacts real-world applications or general dataset types could be explored.

4. **Generalization to Other Domains**: The focus on TGs is a niche aspect within natural language processing and graph learning. While the method is impactful within the evaluated benchmarks, further analysis or examples of applicability in other domains would enhance its relevance.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the work presents a valuable contribution to the field of textual graph representation learning. By simplifying the process of generating node embeddings with a focus on few key techniques, it opens avenues for further exploration in utilizing LMs for graph-based tasks. Future work could focus on refining the interpretability of the approach, examining its limitations, and ensuring the findings can be extrapolated to other settings within graph learning. The anticipated release of code and node features will allow for reproducibility and further investigation by the community. 

The paper is recommended for acceptance pending minor revisions, particularly in expanding on the implications of the findings and exploring the method’s applicability across various domains.
