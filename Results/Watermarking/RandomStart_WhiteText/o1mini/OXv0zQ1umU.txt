### Review of "EVOKE: EVOKING CRITICAL THINKING ABILITIES IN LLMs VIA REVIEWER-AUTHOR PROMPT EDITING"

#### Summary
This manuscript explores the aspect of enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through a novel framework named Evoke, designed for automatic prompt refinement. The authors propose an author-reviewer paradigm where the LLM serves two distinct roles: one for generating and editing prompts (LLM-Author) and one for scoring the quality of these prompts (LLM-Reviewer). Additionally, they introduce a data selection strategy that focuses on "hard" samples to improve LLM performance in various natural language tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that Evoke significantly outperforms existing auto prompt engineering methods across multiple tasks, particularly logical fallacy detection, achieving noteworthy accuracy levels.

#### Strengths
1. **Innovative Approach**: The author-reviewer framework is a creative solution to the challenges faced by traditional prompt engineering methods. The iterative feedback mechanism is a valuable addition that allows for continuous improvement.
  
2. **Robust Experimental Validation**: The authors provide extensive experimental results spanning multiple tasks from well-established datasets. The performance comparisons with both human-curated prompts and existing automatic prompt generation methods effectively highlight the advantages of Evoke.
  
3. **Clear Writing and Structure**: The paper is well-organized, with clear sections that facilitate understanding. The introduction effectively sets the context for the proposed work, and the methodology is detailed enough to allow for replication.

4. **Focus on Critical Thinking**: The paper addresses the important aspect of prompting LLMs to evoke deeper understanding and critical thinking rather than mere surface-level responses. This is highly relevant as LLMs are increasingly applied in educational contexts and require more than just rote processing.

5. **Data Selection Strategy**: The emphasis on utilizing hard samples demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of model learning processes and the nature of LLMsâ€™ capabilities.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Lack of Theoretical Insights**: While the authors present strong empirical results, a more robust theoretical analysis of why the author-reviewer paradigm effectively enhances prompt quality would provide deeper insights into the mechanisms driving these improvements.

2. **Limited Discussion on Generalization**: The experiments primarily focus on specific tasks from two datasets. Future work should address how Evoke generalizes across a wider range of applications and diverse datasets, especially in real-world scenarios.

3. **Scalability Concerns**: The approach may introduce computational overhead with two instances of the LLM working sequentially. A discussion on the computational efficiency of this method compared to traditional approaches would be valuable.

4. **Ambiguities in "Hard" Sample Selection**: While hard samples are emphasized for training, the criteria for selecting these samples should be more clearly defined to understand their impact on the model's learning curve.

5. **Handling of Biases and Errors**: The paper does not extensively address potential biases or systematic errors the Evoke framework might inherit from the LLMs used or from the datasets on which it is trained. It is crucial to consider how these factors could affect the applicability of the proposed method.

#### Conclusion
Overall, the manuscript presents a compelling and innovative approach to prompt engineering in LLMs through the Evoke framework. The strengths of the work lie in its empirical validation and structured methodology, though it would benefit from enhanced theoretical foundations and broader applicability discussions. If the authors address the weaknesses identified, particularly related to generalization and resource efficiency, this research could significantly contribute to the field of natural language processing and the effective use of LLMs in critical thinking applications. 

#### Recommendation
I recommend acceptance of the paper with minor revisions to clarify the theoretical insights, address scalability and generalization issues, and expand the discussion on biases in model training.
