**Review of "The Importance of Feature Preprocessing for Differentially Private Linear Optimization"**

**Summary**
The article focuses on the key area of differentially private machine learning, specifically investigating whether differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) is sufficient on its own to achieve good minimizers under privacy constraints. The authors demonstrate that feature preprocessing plays a vital role in optimizing performance for linear classification tasks in a differentially private setting. They present a new algorithm, DPSGD-F, which combines DPSGD with feature preprocessing, and offer both theoretical analysis and empirical validation of their findings.

**Strengths**
1. **Theoretical Contributions**: The authors provide a clear theoretical framework demonstrating the necessity of feature preprocessing in obtaining optimal minimizers. They present a counter-example illustrating the shortcomings of DPSGD without preprocessing and subsequently prove that their proposed method, DPSGD-F, improves the optimality gap by focusing on the dataset's feature diameter rather than the maximum norm. This contribution adds valuable insights to the current state of the art in differentially private optimization.

2. **Practical Validation**: The empirical results presented on standard datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-100) effectively demonstrate the advantages of the DPSGD-F algorithm over traditional DPSGD. The reported accuracy improvements substantiate their theoretical claims and show the algorithm's applicability in real-world scenarios.

3. **Comprehensive Literature Review**: The paper includes an extensive survey of related work in differential privacy and suggests directions for future research, highlighting the ongoing discussions in the field. This contextualization is significant for readers who may be less familiar with the nuances of differential privacy.

**Weaknesses**
1. **Complex Presentation**: While the paper presents important theoretical concepts, the presentation could benefit from clearer explanations of some of the more complex ideas, especially for readers who may not have a strong background in differential privacy and optimization. Breaking down the algorithms and the theoretical implications in simpler terms could enhance accessibility.

2. **Generalization Beyond Linear Models**: The study primarily focuses on linear classification tasks. The authors acknowledge the need for future research to explore how their findings may extend to non-linear models or more extensive datasets. An added discussion on potential strategies for applying DPSGD-F to more complex scenarios would strengthen the paper's conclusions.

3. **Privacy Budget Allocation**: The paper discusses dividing the privacy budget between the preprocessing and the DPSGD phases. However, a clearer guideline on how to optimally allocate this budget would be beneficial to practitioners wanting to apply the algorithm in real-world scenarios.

**Conclusion**
This paper makes a noteworthy contribution to the field of differentially private machine learning by establishing the critical role of feature preprocessing in enhancing the efficacy of DPSGD. The theoretical insights, complemented by experimental validation, provide a solid foundation for future work. However, the accessibility of the presentation and exploration of broader applications could be improved. Overall, this paper is a valuable addition to the literature and deserves consideration for acceptance at ICLR 2024.
