**Review of "Long-Tailed Recognition on Binary Networks by Calibrating a Pre-Trained Model"**

This manuscript focuses on a critical issue in the realm of deep learning: the deployment of efficient models in real-world scenarios characterized by long-tailed data distributions. The authors propose a novel framework called CANDLE (Calibrate and Distill) that leverages pre-trained full-precision (FP) models as teachers for distilling resource-efficient binary neural networks. The approach addresses the dual challenges of long-tailed recognition and computational efficiency, which is increasingly relevant as deep learning models are deployed in constrained environments.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Framework**: The proposed CANDLE framework is innovative, combining calibration of pre-trained models with knowledge distillation to enhance the performance of binary networks on long-tailed datasets. This approach provides a clear pathway for utilizing existing FP models, making it scalable and practical.

2. **Comprehensive Empirical Evaluation**: The paper conducts extensive experiments on 15 datasets, which is one of the largest benchmarks for long-tailed recognition reported in the literature. This thorough evaluation adds significant credibility to the findings of the research.

3. **Significant Performance Improvements**: The results indicate that CANDLE consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by substantial margins, particularly in tail and median class accuracy. The authors provide detailed comparisons with various baseline methods, highlighting the effectiveness of their approach.

4. **Ablation Studies**: The inclusion of ablation studies to analyze the contribution of each component of the CANDLE framework strengthens the argument for its efficacy. The observed incremental improvements across different setups provide insights into best practices for long-tailed recognition.

5. **Addressing Real-World Challenges**: By focusing on binary networks suitable for edge deployments, the paper addresses a critical societal need for efficient and effective models that can operate in resource-constrained environments.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity of the Method**: While the proposed method is evidently effective, the complexity of the calibration and adversarial balancing components might hinder its implementation in practice. A clearer and more concise explanation of these processes, possibly with visual aids, could enhance understanding and applicability.

2. **Dependency on Pre-trained Models**: The reliance on large FP models as teachers raises concerns regarding the accessibility of such resources. Investigating how well the method performs when faced with limited or non-standard teacher models could broaden the practical implications of this research.

3. **Limited Discussion on Ethical Implications**: Although the authors acknowledge potential biases in deploying deep models, a more in-depth discussion on the ethical implications surrounding the use of AI in high-stakes domains would improve the manuscript. This includes considerations of how choices made during the calibration and distillation processes might affect model fairness.

4. **Results on Highly Imbalanced Datasets**: While the paper claims significant improvements, the performance metrics on extremely skewed datasets (with high imbalance ratios) could be elaborated. Understanding the model's limitations under severe class imbalance is critical for users who may deploy it in real-world scenarios.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the manuscript presents a timely and valuable contribution to the field of long-tailed recognition using binary networks. The proposed CANDLE framework not only addresses key challenges but also sets a strong foundation for future research in developing efficient models for imbalanced data environments. By improving clarity around method implementation and expanding on ethical discussions, the manuscript could become an even more impactful resource for researchers and practitioners alike. I recommend accepting this paper after a minor revision to address the outlined weaknesses.
