**Review of the Paper: "RELU TO THE RESCUE: IMPROVE YOUR ON-POLICY ACTOR-CRITIC WITH POSITIVE ADVANTAGES"**

**Summary:**
This research focuses on a critical topicâ€”the intersection of approximate Bayesian inference and on-policy actor-critic methods within the field of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The authors propose a method called VSOP (Variational [b]ayes, Spectral-normalized, On-Policy reinforcement learning), which introduces three modifications to the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm. These modifications include applying a ReLU function to advantage estimates, spectral normalization of actor-critic weights, and using dropout as a Bayesian approximation for neural networks. The authors assert that these strategies enhance exploration in non-stationary environments and optimize policy updates under positive advantage conditions.

**Strengths:**

1. **Theoretical Contributions**: The paper provides solid theoretical grounding for the methods introduced. The proof establishing that restricting policy updates to positive advantages optimizes the value function is a commendable addition to the literature. Additionally, the connection drawn between spectral normalization and the Lipschitz constant of the value function provides interesting insights that could benefit future research.

2. **Empirical Validation**: The extensive empirical evaluations across a diverse range of benchmarks, particularly in MuJoCo and ProcGen environments, bolster the claims made by the authors. Their results demonstrate significant performance improvements over established algorithms like PPO, SAC, and TD3, which is indicative of the potential practical impact of VSOP.

3. **Addressing Exploration**: The consideration of uncertainty-aware exploration is a crucial aspect in reinforcement learning. By combining dropout with Thompson sampling, the paper proposes a method for state-aware exploration, which could enhance learning efficiency in dynamic and unobserved environments.

4. **Algorithm Robustness**: The ablation studies indicating that no single proposed mechanism contributes more than the collective effect of all changes suggest a well-rounded and comprehensive approach. This adds robustness to the methodology.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Clarity and Readability**: The paper is quite dense in places, particularly in the method sections, where the algorithm details are presented alongside complex equations. It might be beneficial for the authors to simplify some explanations or provide more intuitive discussions on certain concepts, especially for readers who may not be deeply familiar with Bayesian methods or the theoretical underpinnings of reinforcement learning.

2. **Limitations of Dropout Use**: The assumption that dropout can perfectly approximate Bayesian inference in neural networks may be an oversimplification. The authors should discuss potential limitations or situations where dropout might fail to approximate the desired posterior distribution. Further deconstructing this would enhance the reader's understanding of the applicability of their method.

3. **Generalization of Results**: While the empirical results are promising, the authors could expand on the generalizability of their method to a wider array of environments, particularly in non-standard settings that differ from those tested. More discussion on how the proposed approach could be adapted to other variants of reinforcement learning environments or tasks would be valuable.

4. **Performance in Parallelization**: The results regarding the performance drop of VSOP with increased parallelization raises questions about its scalability for real-world scenarios. A more exhaustive exploration of the performance trade-offs in highly parallel settings could be insightful for practitioners.

**Conclusions:**
In summary, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of deep reinforcement learning with its proposal of VSOP and the underlying theoretical justification. The empirical results are compelling, and the approach to enhancing exploration through a Bayesian lens is innovative. However, clearer explanations and further analysis on certain limitations and generalizability could strengthen the paper. Overall, I believe this work will be beneficial for researchers and practitioners looking to improve state-of-the-art on-policy actor-critic methods in DRL. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions addressing the aforementioned points.
