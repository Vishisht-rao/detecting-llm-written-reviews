**Review of "DOUBLE EQUIVARIANCE FOR INDUCTIVE LINK PREDICTION FOR BOTH NEW NODES AND NEW RELATION TYPES"**

The study examines an important problem in the field of knowledge graph embeddings and link prediction, specifically focusing on the challenge of inductively predicting relationships in graphs with unseen nodes and new relation types. This problem is particularly relevant as real-world knowledge graphs evolve and expand, often introducing novel entities and relations that models trained on existing data cannot handle effectively. 

### Summary of Contributions

The paper makes several noteworthy contributions:

1. **Conceptual Framework**: The authors introduce the formal definitions of doubly inductive link prediction, double permutation-equivariant representations, and distributionally double equivariant positional embeddings. This theoretical groundwork is critical for enabling models to generalize across different knowledge graph domains.

2. **Model Propositions**: The development of ISDEA+, a double equivariant graph neural network architecture, is a significant advancement. The architecture is explicitly designed to capture the relationship between nodes and edges under permutation actions, making it robust for the proposed tasks.

3. **Experimental Validation**: The authors validate their claims through extensive empirical experiments, demonstrating that ISDEA+ outperforms existing models like InGram, especially when trained on diverse knowledge graphs.

4. **Original Datasets**: The introduction of the PediaTypes and WikiTopics datasets offers valuable benchmarks that focus on the double inductive link prediction task without additional context, aligning well with the real-world application of this research.

### Strengths

- **Theoretical Depth**: The incorporation of group theory within the framework of graph neural networks is an innovative approach that could have implications for other areas of machine learning.
- **Practical Relevance**: The focus on practical implications, particularly zero-shot learning capabilities and self-supervised tasks, speaks to the evolving needs of knowledge representation in AI.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The empirical results are well-founded, showcasing performance across various metrics (Hits@N, MRR) and experimental setups. The heatmaps and detailed analysis of different training scenarios illustrate the robustness of the proposed methodologies.

### Weaknesses

- **Complexity and Scalability**: While ISDEA+ presents significant improvements, the authors acknowledge issues related to computational complexity. Future work should prioritize optimizing the model for real-world applications, especially considering large-scale graphs.
  
- **Limitations in Expressivity**: The paper addresses limitations concerning expressivity in the presented models. While the discussion acknowledges the challenge, it may benefit from a deeper exploration of potential solutions or directions to enhance representation capabilities without sacrificing model performance.

- **Result Presentation**: The number of tables and figures can overwhelm readers. A more concise presentation, perhaps with integrated visual summaries or fewer incremental results, could improve clarity.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. Consider adding a section explicitly discussing potential optimizations for ISDEA and ISDEA+ to address the scalability limitations reported.
   
2. A thorough comparative analysis with newer inductive approaches not limited to knowledge graphs could enrich the discussion, providing clearer positioning within the broader machine learning landscape.

3. Enhance the explanation of the framework's expressivity limitations, possibly articulating future research directions or alternative architectures that could mitigate these challenges.

### Conclusion

Overall, the paper presents a substantial contribution to the field of knowledge graph representation and link prediction through its theoretical innovations and empirical validations. It opens up important avenues for further research and application in dynamic and complex knowledge domains. I recommend the paper for acceptance with considerations for the aforementioned improvements, as it lays a strong foundation for future work in this crucial area of AI.
