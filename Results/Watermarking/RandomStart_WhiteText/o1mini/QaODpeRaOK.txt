**Review of "DON’T THROW AWAY YOUR VALUE MODEL! GENERATING MORE PREFERABLE TEXT WITH VALUE-GUIDED MONTE-CARLO TREE SEARCH DECODING"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel approach, PPO+MCTS, which integrates Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based language models to enhance the quality of generated text. The authors argue that the value model, a byproduct of PPO training, can be effectively used during decoding to navigate the output space more intelligently than traditional greedy or sampling methods. The results indicate that incorporating the value-guided MCTS into text generation significantly improves the preferability of the outputs across four diverse tasks: sentiment steering, toxicity reduction, knowledge introspection, and chatbot alignment, outperforming existing baselines.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Integration:** The combination of MCTS with PPO-trained models effectively highlights the potential underutilization of value models in language generation tasks. The proposal is not only innovative but also timely, given recent trends in large language model training and evaluation.
   
2. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The authors evaluate the proposed method across four distinct tasks, providing solid experimental results. The reported improvements in metrics like sentiment steering success rates, toxicity reduction, and downstream task performance for QA are compelling and suggest broad applicability.

3. **Clear Methodology:** The methodology sections are well-structured and articulate, particularly the explanation of how MCTS is adapted to work with PPO's policy and value models. The introduction of modifications such as initializing Q-values from the value model presents a thoughtful approach to balancing exploration and exploitation.

4. **Empirical Results:** The empirical results, including human evaluations and various ablation studies, effectively support the claims made in the paper. The comparative analysis with baseline methods is extensive and convincing.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Inference Time Overhead:** While the authors acknowledge the computational overhead introduced by the MCTS, they could provide more detailed empirical analysis regarding the practical implications of this increase in inference time. It is essential for practical deployments to present how much slower PPO+MCTS is compared to simpler decoding methods.

2. **Generalizability Concerns:** The paper demonstrates impressive results across four specific tasks, but it would be beneficial to discuss how well these methods generalize to other text generation scenarios or against more arbitrary prompts. The limitations of the model's robustness in diverse real-world applications warrant consideration.

3. **Ethical Considerations:** The authors mention ethical concerns regarding potential harmful outputs when utilizing the value model. A more in-depth exploration of the ethical implications and methods for mitigating harmful outputs would enhance the paper's substantive impact in the NLP community.

4. **Potential Alternatives:** While the authors justify their choice of MCTS as superior to alternatives like best-of-n decoding, the discussion could be broadened to include more diversified techniques and considerations for other search algorithms. Even a brief comparative analysis of these alternatives might strengthen the argument for using MCTS.

**Conclusions:**
The study addresses a key problem in text generation by harnessing the power of value-guided search algorithms to improve output quality in language models. The approach is novel, the experiments are thorough, and the findings are significant. With a few areas identified for improvement—such as addressing the computational overhead and ethical implications—the paper presents a valuable contribution that holds promise for future research in the intersection of reinforcement learning and natural language processing.

**Overall Recommendation:** Accept with minor revisions.
