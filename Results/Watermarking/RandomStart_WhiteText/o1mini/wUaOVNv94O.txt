**Review of "Automatic Neural Spatial Integration"**

The study investigates the problem of efficiently estimating spatial integrations, which are critical for applications in scientific computing and computer graphics, particularly in solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). The authors propose a novel methodology that combines the strengths of Monte Carlo methods and neural networks to achieve fast, unbiased estimations of spatial integrals, a challenge that has historically plagued computational approaches in these fields.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach**: The idea of using neural networks as control variates to enhance the performance of Monte Carlo methods is a significant contribution to both the fields of computational mathematics and machine learning. This synthesis of techniques addresses the known limitations of each method, particularly the bias in neural approximations and the high variance in Monte Carlo estimates.

2. **Theoretical Foundation**: The paper provides a solid theoretical basis for combining Monte Carlo methods with neural approximations. The derivation of the training objective that minimizes the variance of the new estimator is clearly articulated and presents a sound mathematical framework for the proposed approach.

3. **Empirical Results**: The preliminary experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing variance while providing unbiased results in solving Laplace and Poisson equations. This is especially relevant for practical applications where computational efficiency and accuracy are paramount.

4. **Explicit Architecture Details**: The authors thoughtfully discuss the architecture choices and their implications for model expressiveness, which provides practical guidance for researchers interested in replicating or building upon their work.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity of Implementation**: While the proposed method shows promise, its implementation appears to be quite complex, particularly due to the need for multiple differentiations and the resulting computational graph size. This could limit accessibility for broader applications or for practitioners with limited computational resources.

2. **Trade-offs in Computational Cost**: The authors acknowledge that the use of control variates introduces additional computational overhead, which could negate some benefits in simpler settings. A more thorough exploration of the computational efficiency trade-offs in various scenarios would enrich the discussion and provide clearer guidance to practitioners.

3. **Limited Scope of Experiments**: While the preliminary results are promising, they are predominantly focused on specific PDEs. Further experiments across a wider range of integrands and integration domains, as well as comparisons against other state-of-the-art methods in diverse settings, would strengthen the validation of the proposed framework.

4. **Numerical Stability**: The concerns regarding numerical stability due to division by the Jacobian in the loss function are significant. The paper would benefit from discussing potential strategies to mitigate these issues, as they could pose complications in real-world applications.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, this paper represents a thoughtful and significant contribution to the integration of machine learning with numerical methods for spatial integration. The combination of neural networks with Monte Carlo techniques not only provides theoretical insights but also practical applications that could advance many computational tasks in science and engineering. While there are challenges to address, particularly in terms of computational efficiency and implementation complexity, the proposed approach holds considerable promise for future research. I recommend this paper for acceptance at ICLR 2024, with suggestions for the authors to expand their empirical validation and clarify certain practical constraints.
