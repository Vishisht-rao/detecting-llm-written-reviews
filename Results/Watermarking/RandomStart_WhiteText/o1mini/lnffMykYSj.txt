**Review of "ON THE LONG RANGE ABILITIES OF TRANSFORMERS"**

**Summary:**
This manuscript examines the key problem of transformers' sub-optimal performance on long-range tasks, which has been identified as a significant bottleneck in the field of deep learning. The authors propose a modified transformer architecture, called Local and Smooth Attention (LaS-Attention), that integrates principles such as smoothness and locality to enhance the long-range capabilities of standard transformers. The results indicate that the proposed method not only improves performance on the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark but also narrows the performance gap with other specialized architectures designed for long-range tasks.

**Strengths:**
1. **Significance of the Problem:** The issue of capturing long-range dependencies is vital across multiple domains, including NLP, time-series analysis, and beyond. The manuscript clearly articulates the importance of addressing this problem, making it a relevant and timely contribution to the field.

2. **Conceptual Contribution:** The introduction of LaS-Attention offers a novel perspective on incorporating inductive biases into transformer architectures. The paper successfully explains the importance of smoothness and locality in obtaining better performance for long-range tasks, which has been an issue previously overlooked.

3. **Empirical Validation:** The experimental results provide strong evidence that LaS-Attention outperforms several existing transformer architectures on the LRA benchmark and other datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed modifications. The authors also present comprehensive ablation studies that reinforce the significance of the introduced design elements.

4. **Clarity and Structure:** The manuscript is well-organized and clearly outlines the motivations, methodology, and implications of the research. The use of visual aids and tables enhances the reader's understanding and makes the results more accessible.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Comparison with State-of-the-Art Long-Range Models:** While the authors provide a comparison with various transformer variants, the performance gap with global convolution-based layers like MEGA and S4 is noteworthy. More in-depth analysis could help contextualize these results, including discussions on potential reasons for these differences and whether the proposed architecture can be further improved to close this gap.

2. **Generalization to Other Tasks:** The paper focuses primarily on benchmarks that assess long-range capabilities. It would strengthen the work to include evaluations of LaS-Attention in other real-world tasks to further validate its applicability across varied contexts and data types.

3. **Potential Limitations of Design Choices:** The discussion of the inductive biases (smoothness and locality) could be expanded to consider any trade-offs or limitations these principles might impose. Additionally, more exploration into how varied hyperparameters (like the decay rates) influence performance would provide a deeper understanding of the model's behavior.

4. **Effectiveness in Bidirectional Contexts:** The authors mention the success of bidirectional architectures in competing methods. A deeper investigation into the implications of allowing LaS-Attention to operate in a bidirectional manner could offer insights into its potential for further improving performance on long-range tasks.

**Overall Evaluation:**
This manuscript presents a significant contribution to the understanding and enhancement of transformers for long-range sequence modeling. With its clear articulation of the problem, intuitive modifications to the attention mechanism, and consistent empirical support, the work stands to benefit researchers and practitioners alike. Addressing the identified weaknesses could enhance the overall impact of the paper. I recommend acceptance of this paper for presentation at ICLR 2024, contingent upon addressing the concerns raised above.
