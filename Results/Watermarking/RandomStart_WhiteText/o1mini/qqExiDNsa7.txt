**Review of "Which Pre-Trained Model is Effective for Speech Separation?"**

This research focuses on a critical issue in the field of speech processing: the effectiveness of pre-trained models in enhancing speech separation performances, especially when dealing with contaminated audio. The authors build upon previous research by Huang et al. (2022), which indicated that general audio pre-trained models provide minimal performance benefit for speech separation tasks due to the domain mismatch caused by training on clean datasets. This paper addresses the hypothesis that pre-training on contaminated audio may yield better feature representations for downstream speech separation tasks.

**Strengths:**

1. **Originality and Relevance**: The exploration of using contaminated datasets for pre-training represents a valuable and novel approach to improving speech separation models. This contribution is timely and relevant given the increasing need for robust speech processing systems in noisy environments.

2. **Clear Hypothesis and Objectives**: The authors formulate clear hypotheses regarding the improved performance of models trained on contaminated versus clean datasets, as well as the impact of feature representation types (Fourier vs. time-domain). This sets a solid foundation for the experimental work.

3. **Comprehensive Methodology**: The proposed unsupervised speech separation method using deep modularization is well-structured and innovative. The methodology for evaluating different pre-training regimes is thorough, including detailed experiments with both Fourier-transformed inputs and raw waveforms. The authors provide clear definitions and justifications for their model configuration and loss functions.

4. **Results and Findings**: The findings illustrate significant improvements in speech separation metrics (SI-SNRi and SDRi) when using the proposed methods. The distinctions made between different pre-training approaches and their impact on downstream tasks are well-supported by results, effectively demonstrating the advantages of using contaminated data for pre-training.

5. **Clarity and Structure**: The writing is generally clear and well-organized, making complex topics approachable. The logical flow of the paper, from introduction to results, facilitates comprehension and highlights the contributions effectively.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Discussion of Results**: While the results section provides numerous metrics and comparisons, there is a lack of deeper analysis regarding the implications of the findings. The authors could strengthen their discussion by providing context on how these results contribute to existing literature and practices in speech separation.

2. **Comparative Analysis**: Although comparisons are made with existing speech separation tools, more detailed insights into where their model excels or fails compared to others would benefit the reader. Particularly, discussing the computational efficiency or complexity of their approach in comparison to established methods could provide a more rounded evaluation.

3. **Dataset Limitations**: The reliance on specific datasets (e.g., WSJ0 and LibriMix) for training and evaluation may limit the generalizability of the findings. A discussion on the challenges and limitations of transferring these results to other datasets or real-world scenarios would benefit the paper's practical implications.

4. **Lack of Extensive Experimentation**: While the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, including comparative results across various metrics, additional experiments (e.g., with different types of noise or reverberation) could bolster the claims and provide a fuller picture of the model's robustness.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, this paper offers a significant contribution to the field of speech separation with its innovative approach to using contaminated audio data for pre-training. The potential improvements in embedding quality and downstream task performance are promising. However, expanding on the discussion of implications, limitations, and providing more extensive experimental context would greatly enhance the overall impact of the research. I encourage the authors to address these aspects before final publication. This work holds great potential for advancing the usability of speech separation systems in practical, noisy environments.
