**Review of "Physics Informed Neurally Constructed ODE Networks (PINECONEs)"**

The manuscript explores an important problem at the intersection of machine learning and scientific computing, specifically the application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in approximating the solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). The authors propose a novel architecture termed "PINECONEs," which blends the concept of neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with physics-informed constraints, aiming to improve upon the traditional PINN framework by mitigating some of its known challenges.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Contribution:** The introduction of the PINECONE architecture is a fresh approach that potentially addresses key limitations of current PINN methods, particularly in handling training difficulties associated with stiffness in gradient flows and the memory requirements of traditional optimizers.

2. **Clear Problem Motivation:** The paper effectively highlights the motivation for integrating neural ODEs with physics-informed learning, presenting the stiffness and optimization challenges faced by traditional PINNs. This context helps underscore the relevance and potential impact of the proposed method.

3. **Empirical Evaluation:** The authors provide a solid empirical evaluation using canonical PDEs, such as the transport equation and Burger's equation. The results suggest that PINECONEs achieve higher accuracy with fewer training iterations compared to traditional PINN methods, which is a significant advantage for practical applications.

4. **Comprehensive Background:** The paper presents a thorough background on existing methods, including a detailed explanation of PINNs and neural ODEs, making it accessible to readers with varying levels of familiarity with the topic.

5. **Implementation Transparency:** The manuscript is commendable for its detailed description of the implementation, including the specific libraries used (JAX, Equinox, Diffrax, and Optax) and the rationale behind design choices for hyperparameters and architectures.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Scope of Experiments:** While the presented experiments show promise, they are limited to only two benchmark problems. Future work should extend the evaluation to a wider range of PDEs, including more complex problems and potentially high-dimensional systems, to better showcase the robustness and applicability of PINECONEs.

2. **Insight into Training Dynamics:** The discussion on the dynamic training behavior of PINECONEs compared to PINNs is somewhat superficial. A more detailed analysis of training dynamics, such as convergence rates and loss landscape exploration, would provide valuable insights into the mechanics of the proposed method and its advantages over incumbent approaches.

3. **Sensitivity Analysis:** Although the paper mentions the use of forward sensitivity equations, it would be beneficial to include a sensitivity analysis that quantitatively assesses the influence of design choices (e.g., activation functions, layer sizes) on the performance of PINECONEs.

4. **Broader Implications:** While the authors briefly touch upon the broader applicability of PINECONEs, a more comprehensive exploration of potential applications and implications beyond the tested benchmark problems would strengthen the overall impact of the work.

5. **Comparison Metric Clarity:** The metrics used to evaluate performance (minimum, mean, and maximum relative errors) are reported, but it would be advisable to provide more context around these choices. Specifically, how do these metrics reflect overall solution fidelity in practice?

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of scientific machine learning. By proposing PINECONEs, the authors introduce an innovative framework that addresses some key limitations of current PINN methods. With minor refinements in experimental breadth and deeper analytical insights, the work could significantly advance our understanding and capabilities in physics-informed learning. I encourage the authors to address the points raised in this review to enhance the clarity and impact of their research.
