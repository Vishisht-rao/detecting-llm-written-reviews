**Review of "Cascading Reinforcement Learning"**

This paper addresses the key issue of expanding the existing framework of cascading bandits to a more comprehensive model known as cascading reinforcement learning (Cascading RL). The authors aim to incorporate user state information and state transitions, which significantly affects the recommendation process and the accuracy of predicted user behavior in environments like personalized recommendation systems and online advertising.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Relevance:** The introduction of Cascading RL is a relevant advancement in the realms of machine learning and recommender systems. By acknowledging user states and their transitions, the proposed framework stands to offer improvements in both performance and applicability in real-world scenarios.

2. **Theoretical Contributions:** The paper provides a thorough theoretical foundation. The authors derive regret bounds for the proposed algorithms and offer sample complexity guarantees that are shown to be optimal up to logarithmic factors. The introduction of the oracle BestPerm for efficiently generating optimal permutations from a combinatorial action space is a notable contribution.

3. **Experimental Validation:** The experimental section offers comparative performance metrics that demonstrate the efficiency of the CascadingVI and CascadingBPI algorithms against naive adaptations of existing RL algorithms. The authors provide a thoughtful analysis of their results, showcasing the advantages of their approach in terms of computational and sample efficiency.

4. **Clarity of Presentation:** The paper is well-organized, with clear definitions, structured sections, and a logical flow from the introduction to the conclusions. The mathematical rigor is balanced with adequate explanations of the proposed methods, making it accessible even to those who may not specialize in this subfield.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Implementation Complexity:** While the theoretical contributions are comprehensive, the practical implementation details of the algorithms, especially concerning the tuning of parameters such as exploration bonuses, could be discussed in greater depth. More information on how practitioners can adapt or fine-tune the proposed methods in diverse real-world applications would be beneficial.

2. **Limitation Discussions:** The authors could improve the discussion regarding the limitations of their approach. For example, handling cases with highly dynamic user preferences or extreme states could prove challenging, and the paper does not seem to address how these scenarios would be managed within the Cascading RL framework.

3. **Broader Implications:** Although the experimental results are promising, a broader discussion on the implications of this work in various domains (beyond the tested MovieLens dataset) and how it can influence future research directions in machine learning applied to user-centric applications would be valuable.

**Overall Impression:**
The paper presents a significant step forward in the field of reinforcement learning by effectively generalizing the cascading bandit model to include user-specific states and transitions. With its solid theoretical underpinnings and compelling experimental results, it offers a strong contribution that could spur further research in Cascading RL and its applications. The minor weaknesses identified can be addressed to enhance the paper's overall impact and utility. I recommend it for acceptance at the conference, given its potential to influence both academic research and practical implementations in recommendation systems.
