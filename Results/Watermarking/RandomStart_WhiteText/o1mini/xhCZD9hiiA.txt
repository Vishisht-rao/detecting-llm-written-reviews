**Review of the Paper Titled "Towards Training Without Depth Limits: Batch Normalization Without Gradient Explosion"**

The manuscript explores an important context in deep learning, specifically the challenges posed by increasing the depth of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). The authors address two critical problems: the phenomenon of gradient explosion that occurs with batch normalization (BN) and the rank collapse issue that can inhibit effective training in deeper networks. They present novel theoretical results and empirical evidence supporting their proposed solutions, thus contributing substantially to the literature on the optimization of deep neural networks.

### Summary of Contributions

1. **Theoretical Framework**: The authors develop a rigorous non-asymptotic theory based on Weingarten calculus, providing a foundation for understanding the behavior of gradients in deep MLPs with orthogonal weight initialization and batch normalization. They show that with their specific construction of an MLP, the gradients remain bounded for linearly independent input samples, a significant improvement over existing models that experience gradient explosion.

2. **Orthogonal Weight Initialization**: The use of orthogonal random matrices for weight initialization contrasts with conventional Gaussian initializations, which the authors demonstrate leads to performance gains by avoiding gradient explosion while maintaining optimal signal propagation characteristics through the layers.

3. **Activation Shaping**: The development of an activation shaping scheme addresses the limitations posed by nonlinear activations while ensuring that the network retains its effective training properties. The authors empirically validate that this scheme stabilizes training and enables deeper architectures without suffering from issues related to gradient explosion.

4. **Empirical Validation on Standard Benchmarks**: The authors provide thorough empirical studies on popular datasets (CIFAR10, MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR100). They effectively show the practical applicability of their theoretical findings by demonstrating improved training behavior and performance stability across varying depths due to their architecture modifications.

### Strengths

- **Innovative Approach**: The exploration of alternative weight initializations and the comprehensive treatment of batch normalization's effects are both innovative contributions that advance the understanding of network depth limitations in MLPs.
  
- **Rigorous Theory**: The authors provide a solid theoretical underpinning that complements their empirical findings, bridging the gap between practical considerations in deep learning and theoretical constructs in neural network optimization.

- **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is well-structured, with clear sections delineating the introduction, theoretical foundation, results, and conclusions. The figures and experimental results are clearly presented, allowing for easy comprehension of the significance of the findings.

### Weaknesses

- **Restrictions in Theory**: The manuscript acknowledges that the theory is limited to simplified BN modules and linear activations, which may limit generalizability to more complex scenarios that frequently use nonlinear activations without loss of effectiveness.

- **Scope of Experiments**: While the experiments are effective in illustrating the proposed methods, further testing with more complex networks, including convolutional networks and variations of transformer architectures where applicable, could provide a more rounded understanding of the methods' effectiveness across different architectures.

- **Discussion of Limitations**: Although the authors do a commendable job of discussing the limitations of their theoretical contributions, a more in-depth exploration of the implications of these limitations in real-world applications or future research directions might enhance the impact of the paper.

### Conclusion

Overall, this manuscript makes a noteworthy contribution to the field of deep learning by addressing significant challenges associated with training deeper neural networks while incorporating batch normalization. The theoretical advances coupled with empirical validation provide a compelling case for their approach. Future research could extend these findings to more complex settings and explore their implications in practical applications. I recommend this paper for acceptance, as it offers valuable insights that could inspire further developments in deep learning optimization strategies.
