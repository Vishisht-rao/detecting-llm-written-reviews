**Review of "UNCERTAINTY-AWARE DISTRIBUTIONAL OFFLINE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING"**

This research addresses the key context of offline reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in safety-critical applications, where online exploration may present serious risks. The authors propose a novel algorithm, Uncertainty-aware offline Distributional Actor-Critic (UDAC), which aims to simultaneously address both epistemic uncertainty (associated with the model) and aleatoric uncertainty (originating from environmental stochasticity). The emphasis on risk-averse decision-making in the training of policies is particularly salient given the increasing reliance on RL in real-world applications.

### Strengths:
1. **Dual Uncertainty Handling:** The distinction and dual treatment of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty are commendable. Most existing frameworks often focus on only one aspect, and recognizing both improves the robustness of learned policies.

2. **Innovative Use of Diffusion Models:** The integration of diffusion models for behavior policy modeling is a significant advancement over earlier variational autoencoder (VAE) approaches. This contributes to modeling complexities that traditional methods struggle to capture, enhancing both expressiveness and performance under stochastic conditions.

3. **Extensive Empirical Validation:** The authors validate their proposed UDAC through extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including risk-sensitive D4RL scenarios and risky robot navigation tasks. The results consistently show that UDAC outperforms or matches the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods, underscoring the method's effectiveness.

4. **Clear Methodological Framework:** The paper presents a well-structured methodology, elaborating on the actor-critic architecture, the incorporation of risk-distortion functions, and the training algorithm. The mathematical treatments and formulations are well-documented, providing clarity for reproducibility.

5. **Acknowledgment of Limitations and Future Work:** The authors recognize the need for further research into optimizing the diffusion model's sampling speed and exploring other risk objectives, showcasing a reflective understanding of the limitations in their work.

### Weaknesses:
1. **Complexity of Implementation:** While the algorithm is theoretically strong, the complexity involved in implementing diffusion models and ensuring appropriate training across different environments may pose a barrier to practical adoption. Additional details on the implementation setup would benefit practitioners.

2. **Performance in Risk-Neutral Scenarios:** Although UDAC maintains competitive performance in risk-neutral tasks, its design is said to focus primarily on risk-sensitive scenarios. This specialization could limit its versatility; an approach that blends performance in both domains would be desirable.

3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The hyperparameter tuning, particularly the management of the perturbation parameter Î», may hinder usability since optimal values appear context-dependent. Providing default settings or automated tuning suggestions could help mitigate this limitation.

4. **Lack of Theoretical Guarantees:** While the empirical results are strong, the paper lacks theoretical guarantees regarding the convergence and robustness of the proposed method under various settings. Additional discussions related to the underlying theoretical framework of the distributions being learned would enhance the contribution.

5. **Limited Comparison with Behavioral Cloning:** The discussion surrounding the behavioral cloning approach could be expanded. A more in-depth exploration of its limitations within the paper in comparison to UDAC would provide readers with better insights into the advantages of the proposed method.

### Conclusion:
Overall, the manuscript presents a significant contribution to the field of offline reinforcement learning by addressing the dual uncertainties inherent in RL environments. The use of diffusion models and thorough experimental validation build a compelling case for the viability of UDAC in risk-sensitive applications. Nevertheless, there are opportunities to enhance clarity in implementation guidance and expand theoretical discussions. Addressing these concerns may further bolster the paper's impact in both academia and practical applications. 

I recommend accepting this paper for publication after minor revisions.
