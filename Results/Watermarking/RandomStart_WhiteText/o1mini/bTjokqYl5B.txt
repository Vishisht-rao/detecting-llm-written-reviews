OUTPUT:
The research examines the problem of robust overfitting in the context of adversarial training (AT), a crucial area in the field of machine learning and neural networks. The authors focus on uncovering the fundamental mechanisms that contribute to robust overfitting, which has been a persistent obstacle in enhancing the adversarial robustness of neural networks.

The paper is well-structured, beginning with a solid introduction that outlines the significance of adversarial training and the challenges posed by robust overfitting. The authors succinctly summarize previous work in this domain, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of robust overfitting, which they seek to address through their analysis.

A notable strength of the paper is the introduction of factor ablation adversarial training, which allows the authors to dissect the contributions of normal data and adversarial perturbations to robust overfitting. By demonstrating that normal data is a key factor, the authors provide a novel perspective on the origins of robust overfitting, which is a critical advance in this area. Their exploration of non-effective features and the robustness gap between training and test sets is insightful and well-grounded in empirical evidence.

The proposed measures—attack strength and data augmentation—show promise as techniques to mitigate robust overfitting. The experiments conducted across benchmark datasets (CIFAR10 and CIFAR100) and various network architectures provide robust support for their findings. The results clearly indicate that their approaches can enhance adversarial robustness, and the correlations drawn between the degree of non-effective features and robust overfitting are compelling.

However, there are some areas that could benefit from clarification or expansion. The paper primarily focuses on empirical results without delving deeply into the theoretical underpinnings of the claims made regarding the connections between non-effective features and robust overfitting. A stronger theoretical foundation could enhance the impact of their findings and provide a more rigorous framework for understanding the observed phenomena. Additionally, the implications of their findings for different types of adversarial training algorithms could be addressed further.

Moreover, the discussion around computational complexity, while relevant, could be more detailed. The authors correctly mention the increased computational cost introduced by their methods, but a more thorough analysis of the trade-offs involved would benefit readers, especially practitioners aiming to apply these techniques.

In terms of writing and presentation, the paper is generally clear and organized, with appropriate use of figures and tables to illustrate key points and results. However, minor proofreading is needed in certain areas to enhance readability and ensure that the messages are conveyed effectively.

In conclusion, this study makes a valuable contribution to the understanding of robust overfitting in adversarial training. The identification of normal data as a factor contributing to this phenomenon, along with the proposed mitigation strategies, is a noteworthy advancement. With some revisions to strengthen theoretical foundations and respond to potential concerns regarding computational complexity, this paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field. I recommend acceptance for presentation at ICLR 2024.
