OUTPUT:
The article investigates the key issue of extending large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) to the audio domain through a novel method known as Acoustic Prompt Tuning (APT). This approach addresses an important gap in current machine learning research, as most existing models have been primarily focused on visual or linguistic modalities, leaving the audio domain underexplored. The authors propose a flexible training paradigm that employs soft prompting to adapt existing models, thereby providing significant contributions to the fields of audio understanding and reasoning.

### Strengths:

1. **Innovation**: The introduction of Acoustic Prompt Tuning is a noteworthy contribution, as it allows LLMs and VLMs to process audio alongside text without extensive retraining. This is a significant advancement given the prevalent data scarcity in the audio domain.

2. **Comprehensive Methodology**: The authors detail a well-structured methodology, including a novel multi-task learning strategy that formulates audio tasks in a sequence-to-sequence format. This aspect enhances the model's capability to handle diverse tasks, like few-shot audio classification and audio reasoning.

3. **Variety of Applications**: The proposed model, APT-LLM, is validated on multiple tasks, including audio tagging, captioning, and a new task for natural language audio reasoning (NLAR). This broad range of applications showcases the versatility and robustness of the proposed approach.

4. **Comparative Performance**: The experiments demonstrate that APT-LLM achieves competitive performance against expert models, indicating that it is a viable option for audio tasks. The model's success in the A VQA (audio-visual question answering) task further illustrates its effectiveness in multi-modal contexts.

5. **Clarity of Contributions**: The paper clearly summarizes its contributions, breaking down the framework of the proposed APT method, which aids in understanding its innovations and implications.

### Areas for Improvement:

1. **Experimental Details**: While the paper provides thorough experimental results, the specific datasets used for training and evaluation should be elaborated upon to inform the reproducibility of the results. Additionally, the paper should discuss any potential biases in the datasets that could affect the model’s functionality.

2. **Limitations Discussion**: The authors mention limitations towards the end, particularly concerning the model's performance on speech and music data. A more detailed exploration of these limitations and how they might be addressed in future research would enhance the paper's impact.

3. **Quantitative Analysis**: The paper could benefit from a more detailed quantitative analysis of the various tasks. For instance, including confidence intervals for performance metrics or an analysis of error types for NLAR could provide deeper insights into model performance.

4. **User Study**: Incorporating a user study to evaluate the model’s qualitative performance—in terms of user satisfaction or perceived accuracy—could augment the presented quantitative findings and give context to the results.

5. **Long-term Goals**: The conclusion hints at future research directions, such as instruction tuning and music comprehension. A more detailed roadmap of these future directions would provide clarity on how researchers intend to build upon their findings.

### Conclusion:

Overall, the paper presents a compelling case for Acoustic Prompt Tuning as an innovative method for expanding the capabilities of LLMs and VLMs into the audio domain. The contributions made through this research pave the way for further advancements in multi-modal understanding, and address gaps in current capabilities. However, to maximize the impact and usability of the APT framework, more detailed explorations of limitations and future directions, as well as an improved discussion of methodological rigor, would be beneficial.
