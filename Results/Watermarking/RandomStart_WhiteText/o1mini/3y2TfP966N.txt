**Review of "T-Rep: Representation Learning for Time Series Using Time-Embeddings"**

The research focuses on a critical area: the representation learning of multivariate time series data—an increasingly important challenge given the diverse applications in domains like healthcare, finance, and climate science. The authors propose T-Rep, a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that effectively incorporates time-embeddings to improve the extraction of temporal features in time series. This is a promising approach, considering that the temporal aspect of data is often neglected in existing SSL frameworks, particularly those relying on contrastive learning methodologies.

### Strengths:

1. **Novelty and Contribution**: 
   - The introduction of time-embeddings in pretext tasks for SSL is a significant contribution. Previous models primarily treated time as a passive input without leveraging its properties for enhanced representation learning, which T-Rep addresses effectively. This inclusion leads to fine-grained temporal representations capable of capturing trends, seasonality, and irregular patterns.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: 
   - The authors provide a robust evaluation of T-Rep across various downstream tasks, including classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection. The comparison with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models such as TS2Vec, T-Loss, and others demonstrates the effectiveness of T-Rep in multiple scenarios while using a lower-dimensional latent space.

3. **Robustness to Missing Data**: 
   - The emphasis on resilience to missing data is particularly relevant given the real-world applications of time series data. The experiments effectively illustrate that T-Rep maintains high performance even when faced with significant data gaps, outpacing established methods in this regard.

4. **Latent Space Interpretability**: 
   - The visualization of the latent space and the assertion of learned representations being interpretable adds to the overall value of the work. This capability is crucial, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare.

5. **Well-Structured Manuscript**: 
   - The paper is logically structured, presenting a clear flow from introduction through methodology to results and discussion. The inclusion of thorough experimental details enhances reproducibility.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Limited Hyperparameter Tuning**: 
   - The decision to use consistent hyperparameters across diverse tasks without tuning may limit the potential performance gains of T-Rep. A discussion of how differently tuned models might perform could strengthen the paper's findings.

2. **Comparison to Baselines**: 
   - While the authors do compare T-Rep to existing models, the breadth of models in certain sections could be expanded—especially in anomaly detection. Including a wider array of SOTA methods could provide a more comprehensive benchmarking.

3. **Theoretical Justification**: 
   - A more in-depth theoretical discussion of why time-embeddings enhance performance over traditional contrastive learning methods would bolster the justification for this approach. The mechanisms by which time-embeddings facilitate smoother latent trajectories could benefit from clearer exposition or theoretical support.

4. **Applicability Beyond Time Series**: 
   - The study heavily focuses on time series applications, while the potential applicability of the proposed methods to other domains or types of sequential data (like video sequences) is not addressed. Discussing this could broaden the paper’s impact.

### Overall Impression:

Overall, "T-Rep: Representation Learning for Time Series Using Time-Embeddings" presents a compelling and innovative approach to a significant problem in machine learning. The contributions are well-grounded in both practical applications and theoretical constructs, and the results are promising. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on addressing the weaknesses discussed, particularly around hyperparameter tuning and theoretical underpinning. The paper has the potential to influence future research in time series representation learning and beyond.
