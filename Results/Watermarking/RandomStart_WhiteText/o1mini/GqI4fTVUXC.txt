**Review of "On the Disconnect Between Theory and Practice of Overparametrized Neural Networks"**

This study focuses on an important context within the field of machine learningâ€”specifically, the theoretical framework surrounding the neural tangent kernel (NTK) and its applicability to large-scale, overparametrized neural networks (NNs). This paper raises a critical concern about the relevance of existing theories of NNs, particularly in optimization, uncertainty quantification, and continual learning, when applied to architectures commonly used in practice. 

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty of Findings**: The authors present compelling empirical evidence that suggests a disconnect between theoretical predictions based on the NTK and the actual behavior of practical NN architectures. This kind of critical examination is valuable and highlights potential overestimations in the generalizability of theoretical insights.

2. **Rigorous Analysis**: The paper offers a systematic investigation into three major areas (optimization, uncertainty quantification, and continual learning) using well-defined empirical experiments. Each section is documented with supportive data and figures that clearly demonstrate the shortcomings of NTK predictions in practical settings.

3. **Call for Improved Theory**: The paper effectively conveys a call to action for the research community to reconsider the theoretical frameworks that inform algorithmic designs. It emphasizes the need for theories that are more aligned with the realities of contemporary NN architectures, which is an important message for future research.

4. **Detailed Visualization and Results**: The inclusion of figures that show empirical results aids in the clarity of the presented data. The graphical representation of findings across multiple experiments enhances the understanding of the disconnect between prediction and observed realities.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Scope of Empirical Validation**: While the empirical results are informative, they largely focus on specific neural network architectures. The generalization of the findings to a broader range of architectures beyond those examined could strengthen the conclusions drawn in the paper.

2. **Limited Perspective on Future Research Directions**: Although the paper emphasizes the need for improved theoretical frameworks, it could benefit from a more detailed discussion of potential pathways for such development. Suggesting concrete research directions or methodologies for building more applicable theories would enhance the value of the paper.

3. **Complexity of Presentation**: The paper is dense and may be challenging for individuals who are not deeply familiar with the theoretical aspects of NNs or the nuances of the NTK. Simplifying some sections or adding more explanatory context could broaden the accessibility of the work.

4. **Descriptive vs. Prescriptive Analysis**: The paper focuses predominantly on the discrepancies between theory and practice without offering specific new theoretical frameworks or model adjustments that could bridge the gap. Suggesting a means of reconciling theory with practice could provide more constructive contributions.

**Conclusion**: 

Overall, this paper delivers valuable insights into the disconnect between theoretical models and practical applications of deep neural networks. It serves as a significant reminder of the necessity to align theoretical frameworks with real-world practices in NN research. While the empirical results are robust, further exploration of a wider range of architectures and more actionable next steps for theoretical development would make this work even stronger. The field would benefit greatly from subsequent works that tackle these issues head-on, inspired by the findings presented in this study.
