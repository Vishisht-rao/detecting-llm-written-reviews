**Review of "Learning with Temporal Label Noise"**

**Summary:**
This paper addresses the critical issue of label noise in sequential classification problems, specifically temporal label noise, which varies over time due to various factors. The authors correctly identify that many existing methods primarily focus on static noise assumptions, which may not effectively handle practical scenarios where label quality fluctuates over time. The proposed method, named TENOR (Temporal Noise Robust objective), aims to learn a robust classifier in these challenging settings by estimating the temporal label noise function directly from the data.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Importance of the Problem:**
   The identification and formalization of the problem of temporal label noise is a significant contribution to the field. This work fills an existing gap in the literature, as current methods inadequately address temporal dependencies in label noise. 

2. **Methodological Contributions:**
   The introduction of two robust loss functions and the TENOR framework for learning temporal noise functions are well-articulated. The theoretical proofs supporting the efficacy of these approaches are a valuable addition, providing a solid foundation for the proposed methods.

3. **Extensive Empirical Evaluation:**
   The experiments include a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets, showcasing the method's effectiveness across different types of temporal noise. Results demonstrate that TENOR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy and noise function estimation.

4. **Real-World Applications:**
   The potential applicability of this work in domains such as human activity recognition, mental health assessments, and clinical settings adds significant real-world relevance to the research.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity and Clarity:**
   While theoretically sound, the paper could benefit from clearer explanations of certain concepts, particularly the formal definitions and the mechanics of the proposed temporal noise function. Some readers may find the mathematical formulation dense and challenging to interpret without a solid background in advanced probabilistic models.

2. **Limitations of the Assumptions:**
   The reliance on certain assumptions (e.g., independence between labels) in sequential modeling may limit the real-world applicability of the proposed methods. The authors should discuss potential circumstances under which these assumptions may be violated and how this could affect the results.

3. **Comparative Analysis:**
   Although the paper compares TENOR with several existing methods, further experimentation with a broader range of baseline approaches, particularly those conjectured to handle temporal dynamics (even if indirectly), could strengthen the empirical claims. 

4. **Implementation Details:**
   While some implementation details are provided, a more in-depth description of the architecture, hyperparameter tuning, and training process would help others reproduce the work more effectively. Sharing code in an open repository would be beneficial.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper presents a compelling approach to understanding and mitigating the effects of temporal label noise in sequential classification tasks. The contribution is both timely and relevant, addressing an underserved area in the machine learning community. With some revisions to enhance clarity and address the highlighted weaknesses, this work has the potential to make a significant impact on the field. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
