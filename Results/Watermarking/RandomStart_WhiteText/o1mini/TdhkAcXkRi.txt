#### Review of “Momentum Benefits Non-IID Federated Learning Simply and Provably”

The manuscript addresses an important topic in the field of machine learning, specifically federated learning (FL), where participants share model updates rather than raw data to maintain privacy. In this work, the authors propose new algorithms that incorporate momentum mechanisms to improve the performance of existing algorithms like FEDAVG and SCAFFOLD—two foundational approaches for FL—in scenarios characterized by non-IID data distributions, unreliable connections, and partial client participation.

### Summary of Contributions
The primary contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:
1. **Incorporation of Momentum**: The authors present momentum-enhanced versions of both FEDAVG and SCAFFOLD, denoted as FEDAVG-M and SCAFFOLD-M, respectively. This modification aims to alleviate the effects of data heterogeneity and improve convergence without relying on the assumption of bounded data heterogeneity.
   
2. **Provable Guarantees**: The paper provides theoretical analyses that demonstrate how incorporating momentum allows both algorithms to converge under more relaxed conditions compared to previous methods, which required bounded heterogeneity assumptions or diminishing learning rates.

3. **Variance-reduced Algorithms**: The authors develop variance-reduced versions of their momentum algorithms, FEDAVG-M-VR and SCAFFOLD-M-VR, which claim to achieve state-of-the-art convergence rates under the same relaxed assumptions.

4. **Empirical Validation**: Extensive experiments across different datasets (CIFAR-10 and MNIST) showcase the practical efficacy of the proposed algorithms, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods, particularly under severe heterogeneity.

### Strengths
- **Timely and Relevant Topic**: The need for robust and efficient algorithms in federated learning is ever-increasing, especially with growing privacy concerns. The paper addresses real-world challenges faced in federated settings effectively.
  
- **Clarity and Structure**: The manuscript is well-structured and logically organized, with a clear introduction that lays out the background and motivation for the study, followed by rigorous methodological details and analyses.

- **Strong Theoretical Framework**: The theoretical contributions, particularly in expanding the convergence guarantees of momentum-based techniques in the context of FL, are commendable. The removal of the bounded heterogeneity assumption is a significant advancement in the field.

- **Comprehensive Experiments**: The empirical validation is thorough, encompassing a variety of settings, including comparisons against existing methods, which strengthens the claims made by the authors.

### Weaknesses
- **Limitations in Experimental Scope**: While the experiments cover CIFAR-10 and MNIST, further validation on additional datasets or with a broad range of varying client distributions could provide a more comprehensive assessment of the proposed algorithms.

- **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Although the authors discuss the impact of the momentum coefficient beta on performance, a more in-depth analysis of hyperparameter sensitivity (such as learning rates and batch sizes) would enrich the paper and provide practical guidelines for implementers.

- **Scalability Concerns**: Although the paper suggests improvements in scenarios with partial participation, the scalability of the proposed algorithms when faced with a significantly larger number of clients or data heterogeneity in more complex setups remains to be explored.

### Conclusion
Overall, this paper makes a noteworthy contribution to the domain of federated learning with its novel momentum-based algorithms that demonstrate both theoretical and empirical benefits. The findings are significant given the increasing importance of privacy-preserving machine learning. However, expanding the scope of experimental validation and considering scalability could further enhance the work's impact. I recommend acceptance of this paper for presentation at ICLR 2024 after addressing the aforementioned weaknesses.
