OUTPUT:
The manuscript investigates the key issue of Knowledge Graph (KG) Completion through the lens of Reinforcement Learning (RL), proposing a novel approach termed Reinforcement Learning agent Guided by Multi-relation Graph Neural Networks (RGMG). This research is timely and relevant, particularly with the growing complexity and scale of KGs, which significantly impacts the efficiency and effectiveness of automated knowledge reasoning.

### Summary:

The authors present an innovative method that combines RL with a Multi-relational Graph Attention Network (MGAT) to enhance an agent's ability to navigate through KGs. The proposed architecture aims to overcome the limitations of existing methods by integrating multi-relation connectivity in KGs and utilizing a Query-aware Action Embedding (QAE) module to optimize action decisions based on contextual information.

### Strengths:

1. **Novelty and Significance**: The integration of GNNs with RL for KG reasoning is a notable contribution. By addressing the challenge of multi-relation connectivity, the proposed RGMG model fills a critical gap in existing KG completion methodologies.

2. **Robust Experimental Results**: The experiments demonstrate that RGMG outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets (FB15K-237, WN18RR, and NELL-995) in terms of both query answering and fact prediction tasks. These results showcase the practical effectiveness of the proposed architecture.

3. **Clear Structure and Presentation**: The paper is well-structured, with a coherent flow from problem motivation through methodology to experimental validation. The use of illustrative figures (like Figure 1) aids in understanding the proposed method.

4. **Ablation Studies**: The inclusion of ablation studies strengthens the validation of the proposed constructs (MGAT and QAE), providing insights into their contributions to the overall performance of RGMG.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Clarity and Depth of Some Sections**: While the manuscript is generally well-written, certain sections could benefit from additional clarity. For example, a more detailed explanation of the algorithm's parameters and hyperparameters, along with their selection process, would enhance replicability and understanding.

2. **Limited Exploration of Related Work**: The related works section briefly mentions existing approaches without deeply analyzing their limitations or contrasting them with RGMG. A more thorough discussion here would contextualize the contributions of the proposed model and highlight its advancements.

3. **Scalability Considerations**: While the authors argue that the MGAT component generates high-quality embeddings efficiently, it would be valuable to discuss potential scalability issues with larger KGs and how the proposed method might handle increased complexity or denser graphs.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**: The manuscript focuses primarily on Hits@1, Hits@3, Hits@10, and MRR for evaluation. Although these are standard metrics, exploring additional metrics such as precision, recall, or F1 score could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.

### Conclusion:

Overall, the paper presents a compelling and well-researched approach to KG completion using RL and GNNs, contributing valuable insights to the field. With minor revisions addressing clarity, depth in the related works section, scalability discussions, and expanded evaluation metrics, the manuscript has the potential to make a significant impact. The approach taken by the authors paves the way for future research in enhancing knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities, making it worthy of consideration for publication at ICLR 2024.
