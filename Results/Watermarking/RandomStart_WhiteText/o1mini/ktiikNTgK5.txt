### Review of "COMPRESSO : STRUCTURED PRUNING WITH COLLABO- RATIVE PROMPTING LEARNS COMPACT LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS"

The research addresses a critical aspect of deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained hardware: the need for effective model compression techniques beyond traditional quantization. Specifically, the paper presents a novel framework called "Compresso," which combines structured pruning with collaborative prompting to optimize the training and pruning process of LLMs, ultimately producing smaller models that maintain or even exceed the performance of their larger counterparts.

#### Summary of Contributions
The authors make several significant contributions:
1. **Novel Pruning Paradigm**: The introduction of Compresso sets a new direction in structured pruning by allowing LLMs to actively participate in the pruning process through a collaborative prompt.
2. **Integration of LoRA and L0 Regularization**: By incorporating Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with L0 regularization, the authors effectively reduce the number of trainable parameters and GPU memory requirements during the pruning process.
3. **Benchmarks and Results**: The experiments demonstrate that Compresso can prune the LLaMA-7B model down to a size of 5.4B parameters while outperforming established one-shot pruning baselines across various benchmarks, including commonsense reasoning, reading comprehension, and few-shot learning tasks.

#### Strengths
- **Innovative Approach**: The idea of utilizing collaborative prompting to improve the training-based pruning process showcases innovative thinking and has practical implications for LLM deployment in low-resource environments.
- **Comprehensive Experiments**: The paper includes extensive experiments that analyze various sparsity ratios and model sizes, highlighting the model's robustness. The comparison to multiple baselines strengthens the claims made by the authors.
- **Significant Results**: The ability of Compresso to not only maintain performance but often exceed that of the original LLaMA-7B model is a noteworthy achievement and is well-supported by the data presented.

#### Weaknesses
- **Scalability Concerns**: While the authors mention testing Compresso on larger models (i.e., LLaMA-13B and discussions around LLaMA-33B), there is limited information on scalability and practical feasibility for very large models in real-world applications.
- **Dependency on Data Quality**: The emphasis on high-quality instruction-tuning datasets for pruning raises concerns about dataset availability and the potential variability in performance based on data selection, which might limit the method's generalizability.
- **Fine-Tuning Requirements**: While Compresso reduces the pruning performance drop compared to traditional methods, there still is reliance on post-pruning fine-tuning, which could be resource-intensive.

#### Additional Comments
The paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion on the theoretical underpinnings of the collaborative prompt and its design. Explaining how this prompt was constructed and how it specifically enhances the interaction between the pruning algorithm and the LLM could provide valuable insights for future work in this area.

#### Conclusion
Overall, this paper presents a compelling and timely contribution to the field of LLM compression. Compresso's innovative approach to structured pruning through collaborative learning not only shows promise for improving model efficiency but also maintains strong performance across a range of tasks. While there are scalability and data dependency considerations, the results make a strong case for the potential of Compresso in future applications of LLMs in resource-constrained environments. I would recommend this paper for acceptance, as it could spark further research and advancements in the area of model pruning and efficiency.
