**Review of "Simplifying GNN Performance with Low-Rank Kernel Models"**

The research examines the context of semi-supervised node classification (SSNC) within the sphere of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The authors present a thought-provoking argument that many contemporary GNN architectures may be unnecessarily complex and propose a shift towards leveraging simpler, traditional nonparametric estimation techniques applied in the spectral domain. This discourse is timely, as the GNN landscape is saturated with intricate models that often prioritize architectural complexity over interpretability and performance.

**Strengths:**

1. **Conceptual Novelty:** The notion of simplifying GNN designs by employing classical statistical methods is innovative. The authors effectively challenge the prevailing narrative in the literature that champions increasingly elaborate models as the only route to achieving state-of-the-art performance.

2. **Empirical Results:** The authors provide empirical evidence demonstrating that their simplified models not only perform comparably but, in some instances, surpass current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, particularly on directed networks like Chameleon and Squirrel. The reported improvements of +5% and +20% over existing spectral methods are significant and suggest that the authorsâ€™ approach merits further investigation.

3. **Evaluation of Practices:** The discussion surrounding changes in SSNC evaluation conventions is particularly compelling. The authors articulate how different train-test splits can influence reported model performances, thereby providing a thoughtful analysis that can guide future research practices. 

4. **Ablation Study:** The comprehensive ablation study on various hyperparameters of GNN spectral filtering techniques adds depth to the work, allowing for insights into the critical factors affecting model performance.

5. **Accessibility and Reproducibility:** The authors pledge to publicly share the code for replicating their experiments, which is a commendable step towards ensuring transparency and reproducibility in research.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Breadth of Experiments:** While the results are promising, the experiments are primarily focused on only a few datasets, particularly directed networks. Expanding the evaluation to a broader array of graph types could enhance the generalizability of their findings.

2. **Interpretability of Results:** The paper would benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the underlying mechanisms that allow simpler models to achieve comparable or superior results. For example, elucidating why certain spectral kernels perform better on specific datasets could shed light on the model's interpretability.

3. **Overhead of Simplicity:** Although the simplification of model hyperparameters is a crucial contribution, the authors do not adequately address the potential trade-offs, such as the loss of model flexibility or the risk of underfitting in more complex graph structures.

4. **Clarity of Writing:** Some sections, particularly in the introduction and methodology, could be clearer. Jargon-heavy phrasing and complex sentence structures may hinder comprehension for readers who are not already well-versed in the field.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper presents an advantageous perspective by advocating for simplicity in GNN architecture, supported by solid experimental results. The proposed low-rank kernel models and the critical evaluation of benchmarking practices contribute valuable insights to the SSNC and GNN domains. The work bears potential for significant impact if the authors can address the identified weaknesses in their methodology and presentation. Future work could expand upon these findings by applying the proposed techniques across a wider variety of datasets and exploring the theoretical underpinnings of their performance improvements. 

**Recommendation:** I recommend acceptance of this paper for presentation at ICLR 2024, provided that the authors address the outlined concerns to bolster clarity and comprehensiveness.
