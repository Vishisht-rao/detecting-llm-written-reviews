**Review of "Jointly Training Large Autoregressive Multi-Modal Models"**

**Overview**  
The paper titled "Jointly Training Large Autoregressive Multi-Modal Models" presents a significant advancement in the quest for effective integration of language and image generation models. The authors, Emanuele Aiello et al., introduce the Joint Autoregressive Mixture (JAM) framework, which seeks to combine large language models (LLMs) with autoregressive text-to-image models to produce high-quality multimodal outputs. The paper asserts that their proposed framework represents a novel architecture capable of seamless interleaved text and image generation, which is positioned as a critical enhancement in the domain of multimodal AI.

**Strengths**  
1. **Innovation in Model Fusion**: The paper successfully introduces methods for fusing text-to-image and language models in a unified framework, demonstrating both theoretical groundwork and empirical validation.
2. **Data Efficiency**: The authors highlight an innovative instruction-tuning strategy that utilizes significantly less data than conventional methods, which is commendable from both a resource management and environmental impact perspective.
3. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The extensive experimental section provides a robust evaluation of the models under various settings. The rigorous ablation studies effectively demonstrate the contribution of each component of the model, enhancing the paper's scientific rigor.
4. **Quality of Outputs**: The qualitative results showcased in generated samples underline the capabilities of the JAM-Cross model, with coherent alignment between generated images and text. Direct comparisons with existing models, such as GILL, further illustrate the model's advantages.

**Weaknesses**  
1. **Ambiguity in Configuration Details**: While the architectural details are furnished, the discussions around model hyperparameters and training settings could benefit from further clarification to enhance reproducibility.
2. **Evaluation Metrics**: The reliance on perplexity as a performance metric, particularly for the image-text modality, might not capture the full essence of multimodal generation capabilities. Incorporating additional qualitative and human-centered evaluations would strengthen the findings.
3. **Theoretical Application**: While the authors claim that their model can coherently generate interleaved text and images, the practical applications of this technology in real-world scenarios warrant further exploration. Expanding on use cases and suggesting implications would provide a broader context for the advances made.

**Conclusion**  
Overall, the paper presents a substantial contribution to the field of multimodal AI through the introduction of the JAM framework. By showcasing innovative methods for integrating disparate model architectures and developing efficient training mechanisms, it lays valuable groundwork for future explorations in joint text-image generation. Despite some areas needing enhancement, particularly in evaluation and application discussions, this work is poised to facilitate exciting developments in multimodal generation technologies. 

**Recommendation:**  
I recommend acceptance of this paper for the ICLR 2024 conference, given its innovative contributions and the potential impact on the field. Further refinements related to clarity in methodology and practical implications should be encouraged for the final submission.
