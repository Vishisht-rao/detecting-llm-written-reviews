**Review of "Benchmark Study on Calibration"**

The article examines the aspect of model calibration in deep neural networks (DNNs), a topic of considerable importance given the increasing complexity of these models and their deployment in safety-critical applications. The authors, Linwei Tao and colleagues, undertake a large-scale study utilizing the NATS-Bench search space to analyze the calibration properties of 117,702 unique neural networks across multiple calibration metrics. The paper addresses several pertinent research questions, contributing significantly to the understanding of calibration in the context of neural architecture search (NAS).

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Dataset Creation:** The authors have created a comprehensive model calibration dataset, representing a substantial advance in the field. By leveraging the NATS-Bench, they enable a thorough evaluation of architectures' calibration performance across various datasets and metrics, which is a much-needed contribution given the limited previous studies on this topic.

2. **Detailed Analysis of Calibration Metrics:** The thorough investigation of calibration metrics, including bin-based and statistical measures, provides insights into their reliability and efficacy. The paper presents a well-structured analysis that demonstrates the correlation between various metrics, enhancing our understanding of their interdependencies.

3. **Outline of Key Research Questions:** The study importantly addresses long-standing questions in calibration research, such as generalizability across datasets and the comparison of calibration methods. This focus illuminates critical gaps in the literature and paves the way for future research directions.

4. **Impact of Architectural Design:** The authors provide valuable insights on how architectural decisions affect calibration, challenging some previous notions about model complexity and calibration performance. This finding could inform future design choices in neural network architecture.

5. **Extensive Empirical Results:** The empirical observations derived from the dataset provide a robust foundation for the conclusions drawn. The paper presents a systematic exploration of the relationship between calibration and accuracy, which is crucial for practical applications.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Theoretical Exploration:** While the empirical focus is commendable, the paper could benefit from a more robust theoretical framework interpreting the observed calibration phenomena. The authors suggest the need for deeper theoretical investigations, and this should be explicitly emphasized as a potential direction for future work.

2. **Generalizability Beyond Image Classification:** The findings are primarily based on image classification tasks, which may limit their applicability to other domains. Discussing potential implications or adaptations for different types of neural networks or tasks could enhance the paper's relevance.

3. **Clarity and Conciseness:** The paper is quite dense and, at times, could be clearer in presenting complex information. Simplifying terminology or including diagrams to illustrate key concepts could help in making the information more accessible to a broader audience.

4. **Diverse Datasets in Future Work:** While the analysis of calibration across different datasets is a strength, it would also be beneficial to explore calibrations across a wider variety of datasets beyond CIFAR and ImageNet, perhaps incorporating real-world datasets to assess calibration performance under diverse conditions.

5. **Conclusion Discussion:** The conclusion sections could be expanded to emphasize the implications of the findings more explicitly, particularly how practitioners might apply these insights in real-world settings or during the design process of deep learning systems.

**Overall Evaluation:**

This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of deep learning and calibration, highlighting critical insights into the calibration properties of deep neural networks using a novel dataset within the NAS framework. The findings will be of great interest to researchers and practitioners focusing on model reliability and performance, especially in contexts demanding high confidence levels in predictions. With some improvements in clarity and emphasis on theoretical aspects, this research can serve as a cornerstone for future investigations into calibration in deep learning models. 

**Recommendation:** Accept with minor revisions.
