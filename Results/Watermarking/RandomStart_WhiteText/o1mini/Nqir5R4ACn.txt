**Review of "Simple Data Sharing for Multi-Tasked Goal-Oriented Problems"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel approach to tackling the Contextual Goal-Oriented (CGO) problems using a framework that combines offline reinforcement learning (RL) with data sharing techniques. The authors propose a Simple Data Sharing (SDS) method, which leverages both unsupervised dynamics datasets and supervised context-goal pairs to create an effective learning strategy for multi-task agents. The primary contribution is demonstrating that SDS can provably achieve near-optimal policies under certain conditions, primarily relying only on positive data. The authors provide theoretical guarantees and empirical validation through simulation experiments that show SDS outperforming conventional offline RL baselines.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Framework:** The proposal of CGO problems as a specialized framework for multi-task decision making is pertinent given the increasing complexity of real-world applications in robotics, logistics, and gaming. The definition is clear and facilitates understanding the underlying problem structure.
   
2. **Provable Guarantees:** The authors provide a strong theoretical foundation for their approach, articulating conditions under which their method is guaranteed to yield near-optimal solutions. The use of concepts like "coverage" in data distribution is a valuable contribution to the understanding of sample efficiency inoffline learning.

3. **Rich Empirical Results:** The experiments span various simulated environments and rigorously compare the performance of SDS with state-of-the-art (SOTA) offline RL methods designed for unlabeled data. The comprehensive evaluation and clear demonstration of performance advantages enhance the credibility of the proposed method.

4. **Practical Implications:** While the experiments are limited to simulated low-dimensional environments, the paper argues convincingly for the potential application of SDS in real-world contexts such as robotics. This is a significant aspect of the work that could facilitate future research toward practical implementations.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Real-World Application:** The experiments primarily focus on simulations, leaving an important gap in understanding how the method would perform in more complex and dynamic real-world settings. The authors should address this limitation and suggest a pathway for further research which considers real-world applications.

2. **Quality and Assumptions on Data:** While the authors specify the assumptions regarding dataset quality, it may be beneficial to discuss potential limitations when working with imperfect or biased datasets. Real-world applications may involve noisy or skewed data, which could affect the applicability of the proposed SDS technique.

3. **Complexity of Augmented MDP:** The construction of an action-augmented Markov Decision Process (MDP) aims to reconcile data from two different sources, which can add complexity to implementation. Further elaboration on practical considerations when implementing SDS in real systems could enhance understanding and adoption.

4. **Clarification Needed on Learning Dynamics:** Although the theoretical contributions focus on generalization and coverage, more nuanced discussions on the implications of model-specific factors on learning dynamics might benefit readers and practitioners looking to implement the work.

**Overall Evaluation:**
The study explores the context of multi-tasking in goal-oriented decision making through a clear and structured approach. The theoretical and empirical contributions provide a significant advancement in offline reinforcement learning frameworks, making the findings highly valuable for both practical applications and further academic inquiry. However, the work would benefit from addressing the potential challenges in real-world application and improving its robustness against data imperfections. Overall, this is a promising contribution and I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions focusing on addressing a few of the limitations outlined above.
