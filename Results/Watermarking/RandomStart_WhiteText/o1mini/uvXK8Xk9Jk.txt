OUTPUT:
The study examines the topic of deep neural network (DNN) training through the lens of activation functions that induce sparsity, particularly focusing on the behavior of such activations during the initialization phase. The authors argue that achieving high sparsity in hidden layer activations can significantly enhance the computational efficiency of DNNs, an increasingly important consideration as neural networks grow in size and complexity. 

The paper approaches the challenge of training DNNs with sparsifying activation functions, specifically investigating shifted ReLU and soft thresholding. The authors introduce an instability that arises in the training of networks using these activation functions when initialized in the so-called Edge-of-Chaos (EoC) regime, where the correlation map's condition leads to the exponential growth of variance across layers. This instability is a notable contribution to the understanding of how activation functions influence propagation dynamics in deep networks.

To counteract the identified instability, the authors propose a solution involving the clipping of the activations' magnitudes. This simple modification is shown to effectively stabilize the training process, enabling the networks to maintain high levels of activation sparsity (up to 85% in DNNs and 70% in convolutional neural networks) without significant losses in accuracy. The theoretical analysis is supported by numerical experiments that highlight the practical advantages of using the proposed clipped activations.

The results presented are compelling and suggest that carefully designed activation functions can not only enhance sparsity but also retain trainability in deep networks, which is a critical finding for the ongoing development of more efficient neural network architectures. The paper is well-organized, with a clear structure that guides the reader through the theoretical background, methods, results, and implications for future work.

However, some aspects of the study could benefit from further clarification or expansion. For example, while the authors identify and analyze the instability in the sparsifying activations, a more thorough exploration of the underlying reasons for the divergence and how it can be universally mitigated across different network architectures could strengthen the paperâ€™s contribution. Additionally, more extensive empirical validation on larger and more diverse datasets would bolster the claims made regarding the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

In summary, this paper provides a significant contribution to the field of deep learning by addressing the sparsity in activations and the accompanying training dynamics. The proposed modifications offer practical insights that could lead to more efficient training of deep networks. I recommend the paper for acceptance, with some minor revisions to enhance clarity and expand upon certain points.
