OUTPUT:
This article explores an important issue in the field of reinforcement learning (RL) by investigating the potential of temporally-aware reinforcement learning algorithms. The paper argues that existing RL algorithms often overlook the impact of the total training horizon on the learning process. This is an important aspect as humans naturally adapt their learning strategies based on time, a concept often absent from RL algorithms. 

The authors propose two new algorithms, Temporally-Adaptive Learned Policy Gradient (TA-LPG) and Temporally-Adaptive Learned Policy Optimization (TA-LPO), which incorporate temporal information into the RL objective functions. They demonstrate that these new algorithms outperform their non-temporally aware counterparts in various environments and training horizons. 

Key strengths of this paper include its clear motivation, where the authors highlight the limitations of current meta-learning methods that fail to adapt over varying training timelines. The combination of meta-gradient and evolutionary strategies for optimizing these temporally-aware algorithms is novel, and the results are impressive in showing the significant performance improvement, particularly when tested on out-of-distribution environments.

The paper also provides a comprehensive analysis of the learned algorithms, offering insights into how these algorithms dynamically adjust their learning rules to balance exploration and exploitation effectively over the agentâ€™s lifetime. The experiments are well-designed, with thorough evaluations across multiple tasks, and the authors offer a clear breakdown of their methodology.

However, one limitation the paper acknowledges is the challenge of achieving strong theoretical robustness guarantees, particularly for the LPG model. This could be an important avenue for future work to address potential deployment issues in real-world applications.

In conclusion, the paper contributes significantly to the field by introducing a framework for creating more flexible and robust RL algorithms that adapt to the available training time, an aspect that has often been neglected in prior research. The findings suggest that incorporating temporal awareness could be key to overcoming some of the limitations of traditional RL approaches, especially in complex environments and varied training settings.
