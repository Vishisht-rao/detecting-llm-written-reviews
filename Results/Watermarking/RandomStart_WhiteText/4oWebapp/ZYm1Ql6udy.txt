### Review of "Bayesian Bi-Clustering of Neural Spiking Activity with Latent Structures"

This paper presents a novel bi-clustering method for analyzing neural spiking activity, which clusters both spatially (neuron clusters) and temporally (state clusters) according to the latent structures inherent in the data. The method addresses a critical gap in the analysis of large-scale neural data, leveraging Bayesian nonparametric techniques to model complex spatiotemporal interactions and recover hidden dynamic patterns in neural activity.

#### Strengths:
1. **Innovative Approach**: The paper introduces a bi-clustering framework that combines spatial clustering (neural populations) with temporal clustering (state dynamics) to provide a more comprehensive understanding of neural activity over time. The use of low-dimensional latent trajectories to define clusters is an insightful contribution, allowing for a more interpretable representation of neural spiking data.
   
2. **Methodological Rigor**: The non-parametric approach, based on the mixture of finite mixtures model (MFMM) and sticky Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (sticky-HDP-HMM), offers flexibility in determining the number of clusters without the need for pre-specification. The use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for posterior sampling ensures robust inference.

3. **Simulations and Real-World Application**: The authors validate their method with synthetic datasets, demonstrating its ability to recover true clustering structures and latent trajectories. Furthermore, they apply the method to real-world data from multi-regional neural recordings from a mouse brain, providing valuable insights into the functional interactions between neural populations.

4. **Scientific Insights**: By considering both spatial and temporal clustering structures simultaneously, the proposed method yields unbiased and consistent estimates of latent structures, which could significantly enhance the understanding of neural dynamics under different experimental conditions.

5. **Potential Beyond Neuroscience**: While the primary focus is on neuroscience, the method’s applicability to other large-scale time series data, such as gene expression or financial markets, is highlighted, offering broad relevance in data science.

#### Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:
1. **Model Complexity**: The proposed method is computationally intensive, particularly in real-world applications involving long-term recordings. While the MCMC algorithm is efficient, further improvements in computational efficiency, possibly through variational inference, could make the method more accessible for larger datasets.

2. **Assumptions on Latent Dynamics**: The method assumes that temporal state dynamics can be adequately captured by linear models (e.g., LDS or SLDS). Although this assumption may hold for many tasks, more complex nonlinear dynamics could potentially require extensions to the model, which the authors acknowledge as a potential area for improvement.

3. **Overfitting Risk**: The model’s non-parametric nature allows for flexibility, but there is a risk of overfitting, particularly when the number of states or subjects is large. More rigorous model selection criteria or regularization methods could be explored to mitigate this.

4. **State Duration Modeling**: The sticky-HDP-HMM framework used for state clustering assumes a geometric distribution for state durations, which may not always reflect the true dynamics of the neural system. Incorporating models that can better handle state duration variability, such as Hidden Semi-Markov Models (HDP-HSMM), could improve temporal clustering results.

#### Conclusion:
This paper presents a highly valuable contribution to the field of neural data analysis, offering a sophisticated method to uncover spatiotemporal patterns in neural spiking activity. The bi-clustering approach is not only innovative but also provides a foundation for more interpretable and robust clustering in complex datasets. While there are areas for refinement, particularly in terms of computational efficiency and handling more complex dynamics, the method's application to real-world data demonstrates its potential for advancing neuroscience research. The approach is promising and could be adapted for a wide range of scientific applications, making it an important step forward in neural data analysis and large-scale time series modeling.
