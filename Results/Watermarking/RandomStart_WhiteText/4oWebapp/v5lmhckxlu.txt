This article investigates a critical problem in machine learning: the challenge of providing interpretable explanations for model predictions, particularly focusing on the balance between linear and nonlinear influences in feature attribution. The authors propose a novel approach, the Linear-Nonlinear Explanation (LNE) method, which combines the advantages of both linear and nonlinear models to offer a more comprehensive understanding of how input features impact model predictions.

The primary contribution of this paper lies in its methodical approach to feature attribution. It tackles the issue of feature interactions in a way that is both robust and interpretable. By dividing the explanation into two components—linear and nonlinear—the authors address both independent and collaborative feature influences. The linear aspect is derived using traditional additive models that assume feature independence, while the nonlinear aspect is captured through an analysis of feature interactions.

The method's strength is its ability to combine these two aspects into a single, unified feature importance score, which preserves the desirable properties of existing models like SHAP (local accuracy, missingness, and consistency) while also capturing the complex interdependencies between features. This integrated approach results in more accurate and human-intuitive explanations for model predictions, as demonstrated in the experiments.

The experimental section of the paper is thorough. The authors validate their method by comparing the performance of LNE against other well-established model explanation methods such as LIME and SHAP. The results show that LNE provides a more consistent alignment with human intuition, making it a promising candidate for real-world applications, particularly where model explainability is crucial for understanding biases and errors.

Moreover, the user study conducted on bias detection in classifiers highlights another important advantage of LNE: its ability to uncover biases in machine learning models. The study reveals that LNE can help users identify when models rely on spurious correlations, such as a watermark in images, thus improving the trustworthiness of model predictions.

Overall, the paper makes a strong contribution to the field of explainable AI. It introduces a novel approach that effectively balances the strengths of linear and nonlinear methods, providing a more nuanced and reliable explanation of feature importance. The experimental results and user study provide strong evidence of its effectiveness. However, one potential area for improvement is the computational cost associated with the nonlinear aspect, which could be a barrier for scaling to very large models or datasets. Nevertheless, the method's potential for improving transparency and trust in machine learning models is significant.
