OUTPUT:
This article addresses the problem of generating natural language explanations for the behavior of intelligent agents, particularly in real-world, safety-critical applications. The authors propose a model-agnostic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate these explanations, even for agents whose decision-making process is based on deep neural networks (DNNs). The novelty of this approach lies in the use of behavior representations, which are distilled from the agent's policy into a decision tree. These representations allow the LLM to provide interpretable and plausible explanations with minimal hallucination.

The three-step process of distilling the policy, generating behavior representations, and using LLMs for explanation is clearly described and effectively demonstrated in the context of a multi-agent search-and-rescue task. By adopting this method, the authors show that explanations produced by their framework are preferred over alternative methods, including those generated by human experts. This is particularly valuable in scenarios where laypeople, rather than experts, need to understand the agent's reasoning. The ability for users to interact with the explanations and ask clarification or counterfactual questions further enhances the usefulness of the approach.

The quantitative results are strong, demonstrating that the proposed method yields more accurate and interpretable explanations than baseline approaches. Furthermore, the study highlights the significant reduction in hallucinations, which is a known challenge when using LLMs for reasoning tasks. The authors' findings are supported by extensive user studies, which show that participants find the interactive explanations both helpful and intuitive, regardless of the level of hallucination present.

However, the approach does have limitations. It requires distilling the agentâ€™s policy into a decision tree, which may not be feasible for all types of agent behaviors or models, particularly those with dense or highly complex policies. The authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest that future work could focus on more advanced behavior representations to handle such cases.

Overall, the paper presents a compelling and innovative solution to the problem of explaining agent behavior in a way that is both understandable to humans and accurate in reflecting the agent's decision-making process. The combination of model-agnostic explanations, low hallucination rates, and interactive features makes this approach a significant step forward in the field of explainable AI.
