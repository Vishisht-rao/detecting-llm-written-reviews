The manuscript examines an important aspect of copyright protection in the context of text-to-image generative models. It addresses the growing concerns about generative models potentially infringing on copyrighted content by proposing the ©Plug-in Market framework. This framework offers a solution for proper attribution of copyrighted works, facilitating a more transparent and fair distribution of credit to original creators.

The authors introduce three core operations—addition, extraction, and combination—within the ©Plug-in Market, utilizing LoRA-based techniques. These operations are designed to address specific challenges in the management of copyright data and to ensure that both content creators and users benefit from this market structure. The paper also introduces innovative techniques such as the "inverse LoRA" approach for extracting copyrighted concepts and a "data-free layer-wise distillation" method for combining plug-ins. These technical advancements offer a novel approach to enabling copyright attribution and preventing infringement, with clear applications in both artistic and intellectual property domains.

The experiments conducted in the paper effectively demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed operations, particularly in the context of style transfer and cartoon IP recreation. The results show significant improvements in both the extraction of specific artistic styles and the combination of multiple IPs, providing evidence that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches like concept ablation and Erased Stable Diffusion (ESD).

However, while the proposed framework is promising, there are some limitations and open questions. For instance, managing the growing number of plug-ins in the market and ensuring backward compatibility when base models are updated may pose challenges. Additionally, the impact of excessive extraction operations on the overall performance of the non-infringing model remains underexplored, and further evaluation would be beneficial to understand the scalability and long-term viability of this approach.

Overall, this paper presents a compelling solution to the attribution problem in generative models, providing a balance between technical innovation and practical application. It contributes meaningfully to the ongoing discourse on AI-generated content and its interaction with copyright law, offering a framework that could potentially transform the way generative models handle intellectual property.
