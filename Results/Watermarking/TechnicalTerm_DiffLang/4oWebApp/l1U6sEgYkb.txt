**Review of "DV-3DL ANE: END-TO-END MULTI-MODAL 3D LANE DETECTION WITH DUAL-VIEW REPRESENTATION"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents DV-3DLane, a novel end-to-end framework for multi-modal 3D lane detection that integrates both perspective view (PV) and bird's-eye view (BEV) representations. By leveraging the strengths of LiDAR data and visual information from cameras, DV-3DLane addresses the limitations of existing monocular approaches, which struggle with depth perception and environmental variations.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Dual-View Representation:** The proposed dual-view architecture effectively capitalizes on the unique advantages of both PV and BEV representations. This is a significant advancement in 3D lane detection that could improve robustness in varying environmental conditions, which is essential for autonomous driving applications.

2. **Robust Feature Fusion Mechanisms:** The introduction of bidirectional feature fusion (BFF) demonstrates a well-conceived mechanism for combining features from different modalities. Moreover, the 3D dual-view deformable attention adds a layer of sophistication that aids in effectively sampling features relevant for accurate lane detection.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The authors provide extensive experimental results on the OpenLane benchmark dataset. Achieving state-of-the-art performance with notable improvements in F1 scores and significant reductions in localization errors establishes DV-3DLane's effectiveness and efficiency. 

4. **Clear Experimental Setup:** The paper delineates a thorough experimentation methodology, including implementation details, datasets used, and evaluation metrics, which enhances the reproducibility of results.

5. **Contribution to the Field:** By directly addressing the integration of LiDAR and image data and focusing on dual-view representations, this work significantly contributes to the field by pushing the boundaries of existing systems and methodologies for 3D lane detection.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity and Computational Cost:** While the proposed structure is innovative, it introduces additional complexity that might affect real-time performance. The authors could provide insights on the computational overhead incurred when employing this dual-view approach compared to existing models.

2. **Limited Analysis of Modality Impact:** Although the authors claim to have improved performance through multimodal data, further insights on how each modality specifically contributes to the overall performance would enrich the findings. A detailed analysis showing the trade-offs between using only LiDAR, only cameras, and their combination would be beneficial.

3. **Qualitative Results:** While the paper includes a qualitative comparison with existing methods, additional visual comparisons would augment understanding of improve prediction robustness and accuracy across diverse scenarios.

4. **Formal Definition of Lane Representation:** The paper could benefit from a more formal definition of lane representation and how the 3D lane detection context fits into broader autonomous driving tasks. This clarity could help readers understand the implications of the presented work in practical applications.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

- An exploration of the trade-offs between the proposed architecture's complexity and potential latency in real-time applications could provide further context for its applicability in real-world scenarios.
  
- Consider providing more extensive comparative analysis and visualization of results across various driving situations—e.g., sharp turns, different weather conditions—to establish robustness beyond average performance metrics.

- Including a discussion on the limitations of the current study and potential areas for future work could make the paper even more impactful in guiding future research.

**Conclusion:**
The paper "DV-3DLane" provides a commendable contribution to the field of autonomous driving through its innovative approach to 3D lane detection. The authors effectively address vital challenges associated with combining LiDAR and camera data, showcasing promising results on a significant benchmark. Despite some areas needing further improvement and clarification, the work represents a significant step forward in the pursuit of safer autonomous navigation. With minor revisions and additional insights, this paper can serve as a robust reference for ongoing research in multi-modal 3D lane detection.
