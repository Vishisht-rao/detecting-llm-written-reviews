**Review of the Paper: "Can Language Agents Be Alternatives to PPO? A Preliminary Empirical Study on OpenAI Gym"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents an intriguing investigation into the potential of language agents, specifically large language models (LLMs), as alternatives to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agents in sequential decision-making tasks. The authors propose a framework called TextGym by transforming OpenAI Gym environments into text-based representations, allowing for effective comparisons between PPO and language agents across various decision-making scenarios. The study introduces a novel explore-exploit-guided language agent (EXE) and evaluates its performance against traditional PPO agents through comprehensive experiments.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty and Relevance:** The exploration of language agents as alternatives to established reinforcement learning methods like PPO is both timely and relevant, given the increasing capabilities of LLMs in various tasks. The integration of language models into decision-making processes opens new research avenues in AI.

2. **Innovative Framework:** The introduction of TextGym, which adapts standard OpenAI Gym environments to be more compatible with language agents, is a significant contribution. This framework demonstrates the authors' creative approach to bridging the gap between traditional reinforcement learning and language models.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper performs rigorous numerical experiments, including ablation studies and various scenario levels that examine the influence of domain knowledge on the performance of language agents. This thorough evaluation strengthens the findings and provides insights into the capabilities and limitations of language agents.

4. **Publicly Available Code:** The authors have made their code available publicly, enhancing the reproducibility of the study and providing a valuable resource for future research in this domain.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Clarity and Presentation:** While the paper provides a wealth of information, the presentation could benefit from improved clarity and structure. Some sections are densely written and could be more concise. Simplifying complex terminologies or concepts would enhance reader comprehension, particularly for those less familiar with reinforcement learning and language models.

2. **Limited Scope of Environments:** The choice of environments primarily from OpenAI Gym could be seen as limiting. While these environments are popular and widely used, the paper might benefit from including additional, more complex environments to better assess the performance of language agents. This could help in analyzing their effectiveness in real-world scenarios that exhibit more complex dynamics and decision-making challenges.

3. **Future Work:** The authors emphasize that their work is a preliminary study; however, they could more explicitly outline potential directions for future research. A clearer discussion on how subsequent research could build upon their findings would provide a roadmap for the community.

4. **Overreliance on Scenario Levels:** While the hierarchical domain knowledge framework is insightful, the paper may place excessive emphasis on domain knowledge levels. It might be valuable to explore more nuanced areas where language agents can adapt or learn effectively without heavily relying on pre-defined knowledge levels.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper presents a compelling exploration into the capabilities of language agents in sequential decision-making tasks, proposing a novel framework and methodology. While it has notable strengths, including its innovative contributions and rigorous evaluation, there are areas where improvements could enhance clarity and applicability. This work undoubtedly paves the way for further research into the integration of natural language processing with reinforcement learning, and I encourage the authors to refine their presentation and expand their exploration of environments in future iterations. 

**Recommendation:** Accept with minor revisions.
