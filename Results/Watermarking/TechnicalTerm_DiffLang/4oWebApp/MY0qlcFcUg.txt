**Review of "Denoising Task Routing for Diffusion Models"**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces Denoising Task Routing (DTR), an innovative architectural improvement for diffusion models aimed at enhancing their performance through explicit multi-task learning (MTL) strategies. By selectively activating subsets of channels tailored to individual denoising tasks, DTR aims to address the negative transfer problem often encountered in MTL scenarios. The authors provide a detailed theoretical foundation for their approach, demonstrating its effectiveness across various image generation tasks without increasing the model's parameter count.

**Strengths:**
1. **Relevance and Timeliness:** The focus on enhancing diffusion models, which have surged in popularity for image synthesis tasks, is particularly timely. The use of explicit MTL strategies addresses an important gap in existing research.

2. **Methodological Innovation:** DTR's architectural modifications, which incorporate task affinity and task weights based on task proximity in time, represent a novel approach that effectively leverages insights from prior works. This targeted channel activation leads to improved performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

3. **Extensive Experiments:** The authors validate DTR with comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets (FFHQ, ImageNet, MS-COCO) and generative tasks (unconditional, class-conditional, text-to-image). The results statistically support the effectiveness of DTR, showcasing significant performance boosts without additional parameters or substantial computational overhead.

4. **Compatibility with Existing Techniques:** The ability to integrate DTR with existing MTL loss weighting techniques highlights its flexibility and potential to be adopted in diverse applications, thereby broadening its impact.

5. **Detailed Analyses:** The paper includes thoughtful analyses of hyperparameter effects (α and β) and extensive ablation studies, providing a well-rounded understanding of the model’s behavior and the effects of its architectural choices.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Lack of Novelty in Task Routing:** While the methodology presents a novel application of task routing to diffusion models, the concept of task routing itself is not entirely new and has been explored previously. The paper could benefit from a clearer articulation of how DTR distinguishes itself from existing task routing approaches in terms of contributions and uniqueness.

2. **Limited Exploration of Limitations and Future Work:** Although the authors briefly discuss future work focusing on optimizing task-specific masks, there is a lack of in-depth exploration of potential limitations in their approach. For instance, how the fixed routing masks could potentially restrict adaptability when faced with variable or dynamic task requirements could be elaborated on.

3. **Quality of Visual Results:** The qualitative results provided are somewhat limited in visual comparisons. Including a more extensive set of qualitative results would help demonstrate DTR's advantages more effectively, especially where performance improvements might be subtle.

4. **Theoretical Justification:** While the empirical results are strong, the theoretical justification for the advantages of DTR (e.g., in mitigating negative transfer) could be articulated more rigorously. A deeper investigation into the underlying mechanisms may strengthen the claims made.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, "Denoising Task Routing for Diffusion Models" presents a valuable contribution to the field of generative models and diffusion techniques. The proposed DTR offers a competitive advantage in performance while maintaining efficiency, promoting further research into MTL applications within this context. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in articulating the novelty and implications of their work, the paper is well-structured and convincingly executed. It is poised to have a meaningful impact on future developments in diffusion models and multi-task learning strategies. 

**Recommendation:** Accept, with minor revisions to address the identified weaknesses and enhance clarity in presentation.
