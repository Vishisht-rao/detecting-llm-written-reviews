### Review of "On Penalty Methods for Nonconvex Bilevel Optimization and First-Order Stochastic Approximation"

#### Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive study of first-order algorithms for bilevel optimization (BO) problems where both upper- and lower-level objectives are smooth but potentially nonconvex. The authors explore penalty methods that combine the objectives into a single weighted sum and establish a connection between the penalty function and the hyper-objective. They also develop algorithms to find ɛ-stationary solutions for the penalty formulation, providing convergence results and oracle complexity bounds.

#### Strengths
1. **Novelty**: The work addresses a significant gap in the literature regarding algorithms for nonconvex bilevel optimization. The strong connection established between penalty methods and the structure of the hyper-objective is a valuable contribution.
2. **Theory**: The theoretical results are well-founded and provide explicit conditions under which the gradients of the penalty function and the hyper-objective are close. The development of the proximal-error-bound condition is an important aspect of this analysis.
3. **Algorithmic Contributions**: The proposed algorithms are innovative, especially the transition from double-loop to a fully single-loop manner with improved oracle complexity. This is particularly beneficial for practical applications where computational efficiency is critical.
4. **Comprehensive Analysis**: The paper thoroughly investigates various aspects of the optimization landscape and provides detailed sections on the algorithm's convergence. The use of a range of assumptions and conditions offers a well-rounded framework for understanding the main results.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Complexity and Clarity**: The paper is quite dense and may be difficult for readers without a strong background in optimization theory to follow. Some sections could benefit from clearer explanations and more intuitive motivations behind certain theoretical results.
2. **Limitations**: The assumptions made in the paper, while necessary for theory, may limit the practical applicability of the methods proposed. Discussions on the relaxations or applicability of these assumptions could enhance the findings.
3. **Algorithm Implementation**: While the theoretical analysis is strong, practical implementation issues (such as choice of penalty parameter schedules) could be highlighted more thoroughly to help translate the theoretical findings into practical applications.

#### Additional Observations
- The presentation of the results might be improved by including more illustrative examples that can help clarify how the theoretical outcomes manifest in practical scenarios.
- The paper would benefit from a comparison with existing methods, especially in terms of performance on benchmark bilevel optimization problems. This could provide context and emphasize the advantages or shortcomings of the proposed methods in practice.
- A discussion section that synthesizes the theoretical results and presents potential future directions for research would be beneficial. For instance, exploring different types of penalty methods or other algorithmic approaches to further broaden the scope of bilevel optimization could be a fruitful line of inquiry.

#### Conclusion
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of bilevel optimization by providing theoretical insights and practical algorithms. The combination of strong theoretical results with novel algorithmic approaches positions this work as a substantial addition to the literature on first-order optimization methods for complex problems. However, clarity in presentation and practical applicability could be enhanced, making the results more accessible to a broader audience in the optimization community.
