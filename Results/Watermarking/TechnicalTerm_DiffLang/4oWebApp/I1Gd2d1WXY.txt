**Review of "Adaptive Resolution Residual Networks"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel architecture termed Adaptive Resolution Residual Networks (ARRNs), which aims to resolve the challenges associated with fixed-resolution training and inference in deep learning models for various signal types. The authors introduce two key components: Laplacian Residuals, which enable efficient computation at different signal resolutions, and Laplacian Dropout, which enhances robustness during training by introducing a form of dropout. The work claims substantial improvements in computational efficiency and adaptation time, along with empirical results demonstrating the performance advantages of ARRNs over traditional models.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Contribution**: The introduction of ARRNs is a meaningful advancement in the adaptive architecture space, addressing a crucial limitation in conventional neural network approaches. The proposed adaptation to various resolutions without the need for retraining is particularly notable.
   
2. **Theoretical Foundation**: The paper provides a solid theoretical grounding for both major components of ARRNs. The connection established between Laplacian pyramids and residual networks is interesting and well-articulated, making the approach credible.

3. **Experimental Validation**: The authors conduct thorough empirical evaluations across multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, and STL10). The results demonstrate that ARRNs can maintain performance across varying resolutions while also reducing computational costs, which supports the main claims of the paper.

4. **Robustness to Low-Resolution Inputs**: The explicit focus on robustness, achieved through the introduction of Laplacian Dropout, is appealing as many practical applications require models to perform effectively on input data of varying quality and resolution.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity and Clarity**: While the theoretical foundations are strong, some sections may benefit from clearer explanations and visuals. The complex nature of Laplacian residuals could be simplified for better comprehension, especially for readers who may not be familiar with the intricacies of signal processing and Laplacian pyramids.

2. **Scope of Experiments**: Although the empirical results are promising, they are primarily focused on image classification tasks. It would strengthen the paper to include evaluations on a wider range of tasks or domains, such as audio signals or volumetric data, to demonstrate the versatility of the proposed architecture.

3. **Low-Resolution Performance Context**: The paper discusses performance at low resolutions but does not sufficiently address how ARRNs would fare against models specifically designed for such conditions. Comparing with lightweight models or those designed for low-resolution inputs might provide critical insights.

4. **Computational Cost Analysis**: While the adaptation time is claimed to be negligible, a more detailed analysis on the computational cost at varying network sizes and resolutions is warranted. Understanding the trade-offs of using ARRNs versus traditional methods in terms of both memory and compute resources would be beneficial.

**Overall Evaluation:**
The paper presents a novel and promising approach to dealing with adaptive resolution challenges in deep learning. The theoretical justification and experimental results are solid, showcasing the practical applicability of the methods. However, it would benefit from greater clarity, an expanded range of applications, and a more comprehensive computational cost analysis. Overall, this work has the potential to make a significant impact in the field and deserves serious consideration for acceptance at ICLR 2024.
