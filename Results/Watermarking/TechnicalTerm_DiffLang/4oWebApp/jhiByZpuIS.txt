# Review of "MS FUSION: ENABLING COLLABORATIVE TRAINING OF LARGE MODELS OVER RESOURCE-CONSTRAINT PARTICIPANTS"

## Summary

The paper presents MSfusion, a novel collaborative learning framework aimed at training large models in resource-constrained environments through model splitting. It addresses the challenges posed by limited computational and memory resources in a decentralized setting, employing a unique double shifting model splitting scheme, adaptive model overlapping, and contrastive loss functions to ensure training efficiency and effectiveness. The results of extensive experiments across diverse datasets (both image and NLP) suggest that MSfusion outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) federated learning methods in performance, computational efficiency, and scalability.

## Strengths

1. **Novel Contributions**: The introduction of the double shifting model splitting scheme (DSS) is a significant contribution to the literature. It effectively allows participants to train different subsets of model parameters, optimizing local computations while managing resource constraints.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The paper provides an extensive evaluation of MSfusion against multiple SOTA methods across various datasets. The comparisons made are thorough and illustrate the advantages of the proposed framework.

3. **Clear Problem Specification**: The authors effectively outline the challenges of training large models in decentralized settings, including computational efficiency, data and model heterogeneity, and scalability. This context helps readers understand the necessity of the proposed framework.

4. **Methodological Rigor**: The theoretical underpinnings for the proposed methods, including the distinctions between inter-participant and inter-round gaps and how they enhance model coverage, are clearly articulated. This adds credibility to the proposed approach.

5. **Scalability and Efficiency**: The claim that MSfusion demonstrates strong scalability, with decreased computational costs per participant as the number of participants increases, is convincingly supported by the experimental results.

6. **Practical Implications**: The paper addresses a relevant real-world problem where companies with resource constraints need to collaboratively train models without centralization, expanding the applicability significantly.

## Weaknesses

1. **Clarity and Readability**: The manuscript is dense and could benefit from a more structured presentation. For example, separating the introduction of concepts (like model splitting and overlap aggregation) into clearer subsections would enhance comprehension.

2. **Limited Discussion on Limitations**: Although the results are promising, there is minimal discussion of potential limitations or assumptions that may affect the generalizability of the results. Addressing issues such as the stability of performance with diverse participants or the impact of different network topologies would strengthen the contribution.

3. **Ablation Studies**: While the paper comprises several ablation studies, discussing the implications of these results in terms of practical deployment and user scenarios would provide greater insight into the proposed methods' effectiveness.

4. **Replicability**: While the authors describe their experiments, the details provided could be further strengthened by explicitly stating the parameters used for configurations and experiments, allowing others to replicate their results. A summary table listing all hyperparameters for ease of reference would be valuable.

5. **Comparative Analysis**: The comparison with prior works focuses heavily on performance metrics. Inclusion of other metrics such as convergence rate, communication costs over time, and sensitivity analysis to the proposed parameters would provide a more rounded evaluation.

## Conclusion

"MS FUSION: ENABLING COLLABORATIVE TRAINING OF LARGE MODELS OVER RESOURCE-CONSTRAINT PARTICIPANTS" presents a timely and innovative approach to training large-scale models in decentralized, resource-constrained settings. The contributions regarding model splitting and the insights obtained from empirical results significantly advance the field of collaborative and federated learning. While the paper is generally strong, improvements in readability, deeper explorations of limitations, and broader discussions regarding practical implications will enhance its impact. Overall, I recommend publication after addressing the listed points.
