**Review of "Saliency-Guided Hidden Associative Replay for Continual Learning"**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces the Saliency-Guided Hidden Associative Replay for Continual Learning (SHARC), aiming to address the crucial challenge of catastrophic forgetting in Continual Learning (CL) by drawing inspiration from human memory processes. The proposed SHARC framework innovatively combines associative memory with replay-based strategies, focusing on efficient and selective storage of salient data segments rather than entire data samples. The authors claim that SHARC not only enhances memory efficiency but also offers near-perfect recall, thereby improving the model's performance across various continual learning settings.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Contribution:** The integration of saliency and associative memory presents a fresh perspective in handling the catastrophic forgetting challenge in CL. By focusing on salient features instead of complete data points, the framework aligns more closely with human memory processes.
   
2. **Theoretical Grounding:** The authors effectively leverage related work from neuroscience and relate it to artificial systems, providing a robust theoretical foundation for their approach. The parallels drawn between human memory systems and SHARC enhance the paper's credibility.
   
3. **Comprehensive Experiments:** Experiments are conducted across multiple benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Mini-ImageNet), and the results demonstrate that SHARC outperforms various state-of-the-art replay-based methods consistently.
   
4. **Clear Presentation:** The paper is well structured, with a logical flow from problem formulation to proposed methodology and experimental results. Diagrams and figures help illustrate the methodology and experimental setup effectively.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity of Implementation:** While the methodology is innovative, the complexity of the implemented associative memory may pose challenges in real-world applications. The paper does not sufficiently address how the performance of SHARC scales with increasing numbers of tasks or varying dataset sizes.
   
2. **Empirical Validation Limitations:** Although the experimental results are promising, the study might benefit from further empirical validation in more diverse scenarios, including varying noise levels, real-time data streams, or tasks with highly dynamic distributions, to better understand the generalizability of the SHARC framework.
   
3. **Sensitivity Analysis:** The sensitivity analysis concerning the masking threshold (Qµ) reveals different trends in Task-IL and Class-IL settings, yet it lacks a deeper discussion regarding the implications of these findings on model performance and robustness.

4. **Limited Comparison Depth:** While the paper effectively compares SHARC to various methods, it would be beneficial to include a more in-depth ablation study to identify the contributions of each component in the SHARC framework, and how they interact with each other.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
- Expand upon the implications of using associative memory in real-world applications to elucidate practical limitations and considerations.
- Conduct additional experiments to reinforce the robustness of SHARC against diverse and challenging tasks, such as those involving noisy or incomplete data.
- Provide a more comprehensive analysis of the individual components in SHARC through ablation studies to better quantify their contributions.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a significant advancement in the area of Continual Learning with SHARC. The proposed framework possesses considerable promise and addresses an important challenge in the domain. With minor revisions and additional clarification, particularly around practical implementability and robustness, the work could represent an important contribution to the field. I recommend acceptance pending these revisions.
