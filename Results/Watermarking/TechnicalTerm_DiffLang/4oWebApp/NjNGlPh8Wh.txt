**Review of "THE EXPRESSIVE POWER OF TRANSFORMERS WITH CHAIN OF THOUGHT"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a detailed examination of how intermediate token generation, specifically through mechanisms like "chain of thought" (CoT), augments the reasoning capabilities of decoder-only transformer architectures. It juxtaposes these enhanced transformers against standard transformers to evaluate their expressive power concerning various complexity classes. The authors propose that while standard transformers have limitations with certain sequential reasoning problems, allowing intermediate steps—especially linear or polynomial ones—significantly elevates their computational capabilities. In particular, they establish a hierarchy of capabilities based on the number of decoding steps: logarithmic steps slightly extend power, linear steps enable recognition of regular languages, and polynomial steps allow recognition of all polynomial-time solvable problems.

**Strengths:**
1. **Theoretical Contribution:** The paper offers a valuable theoretical framework linking transformer architectures to established complexity classes. The clear delineation of capabilities based on the number of intermediate steps is a novel contribution that adds depth to the understanding of transformer performance.
   
2. **Methodological Rigor:** The use of formal definitions, theorems, and rigorous proofs lends credibility to the claims made regarding the performance of transformers under various configurations. The authors succeed in conveying complex ideas in a well-structured manner, which will be accessible to readers with a relevant background.

3. **Comprehensive Literature Review:** The authors provide a solid review of prior work in the field, effectively contextualizing their contributions against existing research. This helps situate the current work within the broader landscape of transformer research.

4. **Potential Applications:** The findings suggested in this paper could have significant implications for practical applications of transformers in sequential reasoning tasks, particularly as they offer insights on enhancing model design to tackle complex problems.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Practical Implementation:** While the theoretical results are robust, the paper lacks discussion regarding the practical implications and feasibility of employing these theoretically powerful transformers in real-world applications. The authors should address potential challenges and limitations when modifying existing models to integrate the proposed intermediate steps.

2. **Learning Theoretic Analysis:** The paper largely focuses on computational expressiveness but does not provide in-depth insights into how transformers can effectively learn to utilize intermediate decoding steps in practice. A consideration of learning dynamics and the efficiency of training these enhanced models would significantly enrich the work.

3. **Clarification on Overhead Complexity:** The paper makes several claims about the efficiency of these models based on high-level computational complexity. However, a more granular exploration of the overhead introduced by intermediate steps in actual transformer architectures would offer a more balanced viewpoint.

4. **Incorporation of Real-World Examples:** While theoretical implications are well covered, including concrete examples or empirical results showcasing the effectiveness of the chain of thought approach in practice would strengthen the paper's arguments.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the manuscript provides a substantial theoretical investigation into the expressive power of transformer architectures enhanced by intermediate token generation. It opens avenues for both further research and potential innovative applications in complex reasoning tasks. However, addressing the practical feasibility and training dynamics would enhance the impact and applicability of their findings. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on the aforementioned points.
