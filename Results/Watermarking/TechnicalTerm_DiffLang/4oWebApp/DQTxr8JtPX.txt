**Review of the Paper: “Detecting Influence Structures in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning”**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel approach to quantifying interactions among agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) settings by introducing metrics for measuring influence, specifically the Total Impact Measurement (TIM) and the State Impact Measurement (SIM). The authors aim to provide a unified framework for understanding and detecting the influence structures among agents in MARL, particularly in the average reward setting, which has been less explored in prior literature. The proposed influence measures are validated through theoretical and empirical analyses, demonstrating effectiveness in identifying influence structures across complex interactions.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Contributions:** The introduction of TIM and SIM as methods to quantify influence among agents is significant and fills an important gap in the existing research on MARL. The framework is applicable to various reward settings, which broadens its usability.
   
2. **Theoretical Rigor:** The paper offers a detailed theoretical analysis concerning the stability and convergence of the proposed approximation algorithms. This theoretical grounding enhances the credibility of the proposed measures.

3. **Empirical Validation:** The authors validate their approach through extensive empirical studies, comparing results across different environments—including a randomly generated MARL environment and a coin game simulation. The evaluation metrics seem robust, showing gradual reduction in approximation errors over time.

4. **Decentralized Algorithms:** The fully decentralized nature of the proposed algorithms, relying solely on observing the actions of other agents without requiring their internal information, is a significant advantage in practical applications.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity of Implementation:** While the theoretical components are well-articulated, practical implementation details could be more comprehensively outlined. For practitioners interested in applying the methods, the learning algorithms and their configurations should be more clearly specified.

2. **Empirical Results Presentation:** The results section, while thorough, could benefit from clearer visualizations. Figures 1 and 2 present useful data but could be expanded upon to highlight key findings visually and interpretatively. Adding clarity on how different scenarios affect TIM and SIM could enrich the discussion.

3. **Limited Scope of Applications:** Although the metrics are theoretically robust, more real-world applications or scenarios would enhance their applicability. Discussing potential implications or use cases in diverse MARL domains would strengthen the paper's contribution.

4. **Relation to Previous Work:** The related work section identifies gaps but could benefit from a more in-depth comparison to similar existing metrics in the MARL literature. Highlighting how TIM and SIM contrast with previous approaches could elucidate the advantages of the proposed framework more effectively.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. Provide detailed pseudocode or algorithms for the TIM and SIM techniques to facilitate implementation by researchers or practitioners.
2. Consider including additional experimental scenarios that utilize these measures in varied real-world contexts, thereby showcasing flexibility and robustness.
3. Elaborate on the discussion regarding the implications of findings from the empirical studies—this could include recommendations for tuning parameters based on observed results.
4. A refined discussion of limitations, particularly with respect to reliance on certain assumptions in multi-agent environments, would provide a more nuanced analysis of the findings.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper contributes significantly to the understanding of influence structures in MARL by proposing TIM and SIM. With minor improvements in clarity and scope, it can serve as a foundational contribution to ongoing research in this domain. The combination of theoretical analysis and empirical validation strengthens its potential impact within the community. I recommend acceptance with revisions addressing the identified weaknesses.
