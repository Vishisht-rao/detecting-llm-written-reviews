Title: Review of "RTFS-Net: Recurrent Time-Frequency Modelling for Efficient Audio-Visual Speech Separation"

**Summary**
The paper presents a novel approach to audio-visual speech separation through the introduction of the Recurrent Time-Frequency Separation Network (RTFS-Net). This method leverages time-frequency domain modeling rather than traditional time-domain approaches to effectively capture both audio and visual features for improved speech separation quality. The authors claim that RTFS-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing model complexity and computational requirements.

**Strengths**
1. **Novel Approach**: The introduction of a time-frequency domain model addresses a key limitation of existing methods that usually rely on time-domain frameworks. The paper effectively identifies several shortcomings in existing techniques, justifying the need for a new approach.

2. **Experimental Validation**: The authors conduct comprehensive experiments using well-established datasets (LRS2, LRS3, VoxCeleb2) and provide a detailed analysis of the results. The comparison against multiple baseline methods reinforces the claims of superior performance.

3. **Parameter Efficiency**: The reduction in model parameters (90%) and MACs (83%) while achieving competitive performance is a significant achievement and demonstrates a thoughtful approach towards model efficiency.

4. **Clear Presentation**: The structure of the paper is generally clear and well-organized. The use of figures to illustrate the model architecture and method flow is beneficial for comprehension.

**Weaknesses**
1. **Complexity of the Model**: While the model achieves impressive results, the description of the RTFS Blocks and the attention mechanisms may be too complex for some readers, especially those less familiar with advanced neural network architectures. A clearer explanation or simplification of these components would enhance accessibility.

2. **Limited Variety in Datasets**: Although the use of established datasets is a strength, the paper could have benefitted from applying the proposed method on additional or more diverse datasets to validate the robustness of RTFS-Net and its generalizability across different real-world scenarios.

3. **Ablation Studies**: While ablation studies are presented, the impact of each component on the overall model performance could be further highlighted. This would help to quantify the significance of innovations such as the Cross-dimensional Attention Fusion Block.

4. **Detailed Analysis of Limitations**: The discussion on the limitations of the current approach is minimal. Addressing potential shortcomings or situations where RTFS-Net may not perform as well would provide a more balanced view of the methodology's applicability.

**Conclusion**
Overall, the paper makes a notable contribution to the field of audio-visual speech separation by introducing RTFS-Net, which shows a compelling balance between performance and computational efficiency. Despite minor weaknesses, particularly related to complexity and dataset diversity, the paper's strengths, particularly in novel contributions and experimental thoroughness, position it well for acceptance at the ICLR 2024 conference. A few refinements in clarity and an expanded discussion on limitations would elevate the manuscript further. 

**Recommendation**
I recommend accepting the paper with minor revisions to enhance clarity and depth of analysis on limitations and ablation studies.
