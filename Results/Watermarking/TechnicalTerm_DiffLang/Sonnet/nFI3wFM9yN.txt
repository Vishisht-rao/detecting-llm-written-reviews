OUTPUT:
This paper introduces Fed-GO-UCB, a novel algorithm for federated bandit optimization with generic nonlinear objective functions.  The authors address a significant limitation of existing federated bandit methods, which are largely restricted to simpler function classes.  The core contribution is a communication-efficient approach that leverages a two-phase strategy: uniform exploration followed by optimistic exploration using carefully constructed confidence sets.

The theoretical analysis is a strength of the paper.  The authors provide rigorous proofs showing sublinear rates for both cumulative regret and communication cost under mild conditions. The reliance on a distributed regression oracle and the novel confidence set construction are key technical innovations.  The theoretical bounds are clearly stated and appear to be a significant advancement in the field.  However, the complexity of the theoretical analysis makes it challenging for a casual reader to fully grasp all the nuances.  A more intuitive explanation of the key steps and assumptions would improve accessibility.

The empirical evaluation is less convincing. While the results on synthetic datasets show Fed-GO-UCB outperforms baselines in terms of regret, the communication cost is significantly higher.  The authors acknowledge this trade-off, but a more thorough discussion of the practical implications is needed.  The results on real-world datasets provide further support, but the limited detail regarding dataset pre-processing and experimental setup reduces their impact.  More extensive experiments, perhaps with a wider variety of datasets and parameter settings, would strengthen the empirical claims.

The paper is well-written and generally easy to follow, though the technical details in sections 4 and 5 are dense.  The related work section adequately covers existing literature, highlighting the novelty of the proposed approach.  However, the description of the relationship between Fed-GO-UCB and the centralized GO-UCB algorithm could be strengthened.

In summary, the paper presents a significant theoretical contribution to the field of federated bandit optimization.  The proposed Fed-GO-UCB algorithm addresses a crucial gap in the literature by handling generic nonlinear functions with provable communication efficiency.  However, the empirical evaluation needs strengthening to fully validate the practical benefits of the proposed method.  Addressing the high communication cost and providing more detailed experimental results would significantly improve the impact of this work.  Despite these minor shortcomings, the theoretical contributions alone make this a valuable addition to the ICLR 2024 conference.
