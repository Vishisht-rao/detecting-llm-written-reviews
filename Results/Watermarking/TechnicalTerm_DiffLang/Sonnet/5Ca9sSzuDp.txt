OUTPUT:
This paper presents a compelling approach to interpreting CLIP's image representation through text-based decomposition. The authors cleverly leverage CLIP's architecture and its inherent vision-language space to decompose the image representation into interpretable elements attributed to individual attention heads and image locations.  The proposed TEXTSPAN algorithm is a particularly strong contribution, effectively labeling latent directions within each attention head with text descriptions, revealing specialized roles for many heads.  The demonstration of property-specific heads (e.g., shape, color, location) is insightful and well-supported by visualizations.

The application of these findings to improve downstream tasks is also impressive.  The success in mitigating spurious correlations on the Waterbirds dataset and the creation of a state-of-the-art zero-shot image segmenter demonstrate the practical value of the proposed methodology.  The visualizations effectively communicate the findings, and the quantitative results are clearly presented and convincingly support the claims.

However, the paper could benefit from addressing some limitations. The focus on direct effects, while understandable given the complexity of the model, limits the scope of the interpretation.  Exploring indirect effects and information flow between layers would significantly enrich the analysis.  The acknowledgment that not all attention heads exhibit clearly defined roles is important, and further investigation into the reasons for this (e.g., head collaboration, limitations of the description pool) would strengthen the conclusions.

The related work section is comprehensive, effectively positioning the contribution within the broader context of vision model interpretability and contrastive vision-language models.  The writing is clear and concise, making the paper accessible to a wide audience.

Overall, this is a strong and impactful paper that makes significant contributions to our understanding of CLIP. The proposed methodology is novel, the results are impressive, and the findings have clear practical implications.  Addressing the identified limitations would further enhance the paper's contribution.  I recommend acceptance.
