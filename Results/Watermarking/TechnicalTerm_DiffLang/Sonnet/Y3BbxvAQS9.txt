OUTPUT:
This paper presents DECOMP OPT, a novel method for structure-based molecular optimization using a controllable and decomposed diffusion model.  The authors address a significant limitation of existing 3D generative models in drug discovery: the inability to reliably generate molecules with desired properties beyond those present in the training data.  The proposed approach cleverly combines diffusion models for learning molecular grammar with an iterative optimization process to directly target desired properties.

The decomposition of ligands into substructures (arms and scaffold) is a key strength, allowing for fine-grained control and local optimization. This approach is well-motivated and effectively addresses the challenge of controllable generation, encompassing both de novo design and tasks like R-group optimization and scaffold hopping.  The use of SE(3)-equivariant neural networks for encoding arm and subpocket information is a technically sound choice, leveraging recent advances in geometric deep learning.  The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark for de novo design and showing promising results in controllable generation tasks.

However, some aspects could be strengthened. The description of the multi-objective optimization score could be more detailed.  While Z-scores are mentioned, the specific weighting scheme and the rationale behind the chosen weights are not explicitly clarified.  Further clarification on the re-docking procedure and its impact on the overall performance would also be beneficial.  The ablation studies provide valuable insights, but additional experiments might be considered. For instance, a more thorough comparison of different optimization algorithms within the DECOMP OPT framework could further elucidate the contribution of the chosen optimization strategy.

The paper's presentation is generally clear, but some figures could benefit from improved clarity and labeling.  The visualizations of R-group optimization and scaffold hopping, while illustrative, could be enhanced to more clearly highlight the changes introduced during the optimization process.


Overall, this is a strong paper that presents a significant contribution to the field of structure-based drug design. The proposed method addresses a critical challenge and demonstrates compelling results.  Addressing the minor suggestions mentioned above would further enhance the paper's impact and clarity.  The work is well-positioned for publication at ICLR 2024.
