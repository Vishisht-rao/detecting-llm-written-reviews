OUTPUT:
This paper introduces RepCodec, a novel speech representation codec for semantic speech tokenization.  The core idea is to use a neural codec to learn a vector quantization codebook for reconstructing speech representations from encoders like HuBERT or data2vec, aiming to minimize information loss during discretization compared to traditional k-means approaches.  The authors evaluate RepCodec on downstream tasks of decoder-only ASR and unit-to-speech resynthesis, demonstrating significant improvements in WER over k-means and VQ baselines across various speech encoders and even multiple languages.

Strengths:

* The core idea of using a neural codec to reduce information loss during speech tokenization is innovative and well-motivated.  The problem of information loss in existing methods is clearly articulated.
* The experimental results are compelling, showing consistent improvements over strong baselines across multiple settings (different encoders, languages, and downstream tasks).  The inclusion of EnCodec as a baseline is relevant and provides a useful comparison.
* The paper is well-written and generally easy to follow. The architecture is clearly described, and the methodology is transparent.  The ablation study on the loss weights provides additional insight.
* The analysis section, exploring the relationship between PNMI, reconstruction loss, and WER, is insightful and challenges the common assumption that higher PNMI directly correlates with better downstream performance.  This adds value to the work beyond simply demonstrating improved WER.

Weaknesses:

* The paper lacks a thorough discussion of the computational cost of RepCodec compared to k-means. While the authors mention computational demands of high bitrate acoustic tokens, a direct comparison of RepCodec's training and inference time with k-means would strengthen the argument for its practicality.
* More detail on the choice of hyperparameters for the codec (e.g., number of layers, residual units) and the optimization procedure (e.g., learning rate schedule) would enhance the reproducibility of the results.  Appendix B provides some details, but a more comprehensive description in the main body would be beneficial.
* The analysis on the relationship between PNMI and WER is interesting, but could be further strengthened with a more formal analysis or theoretical justification. The current discussion is largely observational.
* While the multilingual experiments are a positive contribution, a more in-depth analysis of performance across different languages would be valuable.  Simple WER differences don't fully capture the nuances of cross-lingual performance.

Overall:

This is a strong paper that addresses an important problem in speech processing. The proposed method, RepCodec, shows promising results and offers a potentially valuable contribution to the field.  Addressing the weaknesses mentioned above, particularly concerning computational cost and a more rigorous analysis of the PNMI/WER relationship, would further solidify the paper's impact.  I recommend acceptance, pending minor revisions to address these points.
