OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the problem of multi-model forgetting in one-shot neural architecture search (NAS).  The authors propose Orthogonal Gradient Learning (OGL), a novel training paradigm that updates the weights of overlapping structures in a direction orthogonal to the gradient space of previously trained architectures.  This is intended to mitigate the overwriting of well-trained weights, a key issue in weight-sharing NAS approaches.

The paper is well-structured and clearly presents the problem, the proposed solution, and the experimental results. The introduction effectively contextualizes the work within the existing literature on one-shot NAS and multi-model forgetting, highlighting the limitations of previous approaches like weight plasticity loss and disturbance-immune methods.  The proposed OGL method is described clearly, including a theoretical analysis with a proof of Lemma 1 and Theorem 1.  The inclusion of these theoretical arguments strengthens the paper.  The design of the gradient space using PCA is a practical contribution, addressing the potential issue of projector attenuation observed in previous work.

The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, covering CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.  The comparison with a range of state-of-the-art baselines and other multi-model forgetting techniques is thorough. The results demonstrate that OGL effectively mitigates multi-model forgetting, leading to improved test accuracy and a more reliable architecture ranking.  The visualization of discovered cells is helpful.  However,  the discussion of computational costs could be improved. While the paper mentions slightly higher FLOPs and lower search costs, a more detailed analysis comparing the overall computational budget of OGL with other methods is warranted.

A minor weakness lies in the lack of detail regarding the implementation of PCA in the gradient space construction.  Clarification on the choice of dimensionality reduction and its impact on performance would strengthen this aspect.  Additionally, the supplementary materials are referenced extensively but not included in the submitted version.  The completeness of the paper would be significantly improved with their inclusion.

Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of one-shot NAS. The proposed OGL method is well-motivated, clearly described, and supported by strong empirical evidence.  While minor improvements to the clarity and detail of certain sections are recommended, the paper is well-written and presents a valuable contribution to the community.  I recommend acceptance, pending the inclusion of the supplementary materials and a more thorough discussion of computational trade-offs.
