OUTPUT:
This paper proposes a novel approach to algorithmic recourse that addresses the challenge of generating feasible and actionable counterfactual explanations without relying on prior knowledge of the underlying structural causal model (SCM) or causal graph.  The core idea is to model algorithmic recourse as manipulating exogenous noise in the data-generating process, leveraging nonlinear independent component analysis (ICA) to identify and constrain the variation of this noise.  Two methods, AR-L2 and AR-Nuc, are introduced, constraining the L2 norm and nuclear norm of the exogenous noise variations, respectively.

The paper's strengths lie in its originality and ambition.  The proposed approach is a significant departure from existing methods that often require inaccessible SCMs or causal graphs. The theoretical framework, connecting algorithmic recourse to ICA and providing theorems on the identification and constraint of exogenous noise variations, is well-developed and provides a strong foundation for the proposed methods.  The experimental evaluation on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of AR-L2 and AR-Nuc in improving the feasibility of counterfactual explanations while maintaining validity and proximity. The comparison to various baselines, including those with partial or full causal knowledge, highlights the advantages of the proposed approach.  The authors also address the scalability issue by showing that their methods are more efficient than baselines in high-dimensional settings.

However, there are also some weaknesses. The assumptions underlying the theoretical framework, particularly the causal sufficiency assumption, are quite strong and limit the applicability of the method to real-world scenarios where unobserved confounders are likely present. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of these limitations and potential ways to relax these assumptions.  While the experimental results are encouraging, a more thorough ablation study would strengthen the paper.  For example, the impact of different hyperparameters, the choice of the algorithmic recourse model (CVAE), and the details of the ICA implementation could be explored more extensively. The clarity of some parts of the theoretical analysis could also be improved, potentially with more intuitive explanations or supplementary materials. Finally, a discussion of the computational cost of the proposed methods, especially in high-dimensional settings, would be beneficial.


Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of algorithmic recourse.  The proposed approach is novel, theoretically well-grounded, and empirically supported.  Addressing the aforementioned weaknesses would further enhance the paper's impact.  The paper is suitable for acceptance to ICLR 2023, pending minor revisions to clarify some aspects of the methodology and to further address the limitations of the proposed approach.
