OUTPUT:
This paper introduces Robust Policy Improvement (RPI), a novel algorithm for reinforcement learning (RL) that blends imitation learning (IL) and RL to improve sample efficiency and robustness.  The core idea is to interleave IL and RL based on an online estimate of their relative performance, using IL for exploration in the early stages and transitioning to RL as the learned policy improves.  The algorithm incorporates two key components: Robust Active Policy Selection (RAPS) and Robust Policy Gradient (RPG).

The paper is well-written and clearly explains the algorithm. The theoretical analysis, while building on previous work, provides a useful lower bound on the performance of RPI, showing improvement over existing methods.  The empirical evaluation on eight diverse tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite and Meta-World is comprehensive and demonstrates the superior performance of RPI compared to several strong baselines, including MAMBA and MAPS.  The ablation studies further support the effectiveness of RPI's key components.  The visualization of the active switching between IL and RL (Figure 4) provides valuable insight into the algorithm's behavior.

However, some aspects could be improved.  While the paper mentions that RPI handles suboptimal and black-box oracles, a more detailed discussion on the types of suboptimality handled and the sensitivity to oracle quality would be beneficial.  The choice of hyperparameters, particularly the confidence threshold Γs, seems somewhat arbitrary.  A more thorough sensitivity analysis of this parameter would strengthen the results.  Additionally, the comparison to MAPS, while acknowledging differences in experimental setup, could be made more rigorous by using a common evaluation protocol.  The appendix provides additional information, but some of the discussions, like those on the limitations of prior art, could be integrated more seamlessly into the main body of the paper.


Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of robust policy improvement.  The proposed RPI algorithm is well-motivated, theoretically sound, and empirically validated. The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow.  However, addressing the minor shortcomings mentioned above would significantly enhance the paper's impact.  I recommend acceptance to ICLR 2024.
