OUTPUT:
This paper tackles the important and timely problem of strategic classification, extending existing work by considering imitative strategic behaviors with unforeseeable outcomes.  The authors introduce a novel probabilistic model within a Stackelberg game framework, capturing both manipulation and improvement behaviors in a more realistic way than previous approaches.  The key contribution lies in the probabilistic modeling of outcomes and costs, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in real-world scenarios where individuals may not perfectly foresee the consequences of their actions.

The decomposition of the objective difference between strategic and non-strategic decision-makers into three interpretable terms (benefit from successful improvement, loss from failed improvement, loss from manipulation) is a significant strength. This provides valuable insights into the decision-maker's preferences and allows for the introduction of a general strategic decision-maker with adjusted preferences.  The analysis of how adjusting these preferences affects the optimal policy, individual best responses, and algorithmic fairness is insightful and well-supported by theoretical results (Theorems 2.3, 4.1, 4.5, 4.6, Propositions 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, and Corollary 4.7).  The theorems and propositions clearly articulate the conditions under which manipulation can be disincentivized and fairness improved.

The experimental validation on both synthetic and real (FICO) data strengthens the claims.  The results demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed framework and support the theoretical findings. The inclusion of both synthetic and real-world data sets enhances the paper's credibility.

However, some limitations should be addressed. The assumptions made (e.g., Assumptions 2.1 and 2.2) should be further discussed regarding their applicability in different real-world settings.  The challenge of accurately estimating the model parameters (q and ϵ) in practice is acknowledged, but a more detailed discussion of the robustness of the results to parameter estimation errors would be beneficial.  Furthermore, the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive discussion of the computational complexity of finding the optimal strategic policy under adjusted preferences, especially in high-dimensional feature spaces.

Overall, this paper makes a solid contribution to the field of strategic classification. The proposed framework is novel, the theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the empirical results are convincing.  Addressing the aforementioned limitations would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact.  The paper is well-written and clearly presented, making it accessible to a broad audience.  I recommend acceptance.
