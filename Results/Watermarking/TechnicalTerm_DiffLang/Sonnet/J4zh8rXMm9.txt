OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the significant problem of forgetting in federated learning (FL), particularly under severe data heterogeneity.  The authors convincingly demonstrate that forgetting occurs in both local and global update phases, a nuanced understanding often overlooked in previous work.  The proposed forgetting metric, Ft, provides a granular measurement of per-class accuracy drops, effectively capturing forgetting without being masked by concurrent knowledge gains. This is a valuable contribution, improving upon previous coarser-grained metrics.

The Flashback algorithm, employing dynamic knowledge distillation, is a novel approach to mitigate this forgetting.  The dynamic adjustment of the distillation loss based on label counts is particularly insightful and addresses the imbalance inherent in heterogeneous datasets.  The algorithmic description is clear, and the rationale behind the design choices is well-justified.

The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, covering multiple datasets and heterogeneity levels.  The results strongly support the paper's claims, showing significant improvements in convergence speed and stability compared to several strong baselines, including FedAvg, FedDF, FedNTD, FedProx, FedReg, and MOON.  The up to 88.5x speedup is impressive and highlights the effectiveness of Flashback. The visualization of per-class accuracy changes further strengthens the argument by visually demonstrating the reduction in forgetting.

However, the paper could benefit from further discussion on the computational overhead introduced by the dynamic distillation. While the authors mention that the additional cost is less than an extra local epoch and comparable to FedNTD, quantifying this precisely would strengthen the analysis.  Additionally, the assumption of a public dataset, albeit small in some cases, needs a more thorough justification and discussion of its limitations. Exploring scenarios with no public data or variations in public data distribution would enhance the robustness of the findings.

The related work section adequately covers existing FL algorithms and those addressing forgetting, clearly positioning Flashback within the current literature.  The comparison with FedReg and FedNTD is particularly insightful, highlighting the unique contributions of Flashback in addressing forgetting holistically.

Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of federated learning. The thorough analysis of forgetting, the novel Flashback algorithm, and the comprehensive experimental results strongly support the paper's claims.  Addressing the minor points mentioned above would further strengthen the paper and solidify its impact on the community.  I recommend acceptance to ICLR 2024.
