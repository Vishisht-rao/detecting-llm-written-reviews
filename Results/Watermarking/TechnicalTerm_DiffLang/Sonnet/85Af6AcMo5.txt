OUTPUT:
This paper introduces SciRE-Solver, a novel sampling algorithm for diffusion models.  The core contribution is the Recursive Difference (RD) method for efficiently estimating derivatives of the score function, a crucial step in many fast sampling algorithms based on solving diffusion ODEs.  The authors build upon existing ODE solvers like DPM-Solver, incorporating RD to improve both efficiency and stability, particularly when using a small number of score function evaluations (NFEs).

The paper is well-structured and generally easy to follow, although the mathematical derivations in sections 3.1 and 3.2 are quite dense and could benefit from more intuitive explanations or illustrative examples. The notation is somewhat heavy, which might make it challenging for readers unfamiliar with the intricacies of numerical ODE solvers and diffusion models.

The experimental results are strong and convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of SciRE-Solver. The achieved FID scores are state-of-the-art for several benchmark datasets and model configurations, especially at low NFEs.  The ablation studies comparing RD to finite difference methods and the comparison to DPM-Solver are valuable in highlighting the specific contributions of the proposed method.  The inclusion of results on text-to-image generation further broadens the scope and impact of the work.

However, some aspects could be strengthened.  The theoretical analysis, while present, could be more rigorous.  The convergence order guarantee in Theorem 3.2 feels somewhat underdeveloped, lacking a detailed proof and relying on several assumptions (Assumptions F.1-F.3).  A more detailed explanation of these assumptions and their implications would be beneficial.  Additionally, the paper lacks a comprehensive discussion of the computational cost of SciRE-Solver relative to other methods. While the authors mention the negligible cost of computing rNSR(·), a more thorough comparison of the overall computational complexity would strengthen the claims of improved efficiency.

Finally, the paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of limitations.  Are there specific types of diffusion models or datasets where SciRE-Solver performs less well?  What are the potential drawbacks of the RD method, and how might these be addressed in future work?

Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of diffusion model sampling. The proposed SciRE-Solver, with its RD method, achieves impressive empirical results and opens up promising avenues for future research.  Addressing the points raised above regarding theoretical rigor, computational cost analysis, and limitations would further enhance the paper's impact.  I recommend acceptance, pending minor revisions.
