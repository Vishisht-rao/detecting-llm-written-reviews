OUTPUT:
This paper presents LaMo, a framework for offline reinforcement learning that leverages pre-trained language models (LLMs). The core idea is to initialize a Decision Transformer (DT) with an LLM, then fine-tune it using a parameter-efficient method like LoRA.  The authors also introduce non-linear MLP transformations for embeddings and an auxiliary language prediction loss.

The paper's strengths lie in its clear motivation, well-defined methodology, and comprehensive experimental evaluation.  The ablation studies effectively demonstrate the contribution of each component of LaMo. The results show state-of-the-art performance on sparse-reward tasks and a closing of the gap between value-based methods and DTs on dense-reward tasks, particularly in low-data regimes.  The authors clearly articulate the benefits of using LLMs for their inductive biases and generalization abilities in data-scarce scenarios.  The availability of code and a project website further enhances the paper's impact.

However, some weaknesses should be addressed.  While LaMo shows significant improvements over DT and Wiki-RL, its advantage over strong value-based methods like CQL is less consistent, especially in dense-reward, high-data scenarios. The paper acknowledges this, but a deeper discussion of why value-based methods still hold an edge in certain settings would strengthen the analysis. The auxiliary language prediction loss seems to be most beneficial in sparse-reward tasks; further investigation into its broader applicability and impact is needed.  The reliance on GPT-2, while justified by its computational affordability, limits the exploration of the potential of larger, more powerful LLMs. The authors mention this limitation, and future work exploring larger models would be valuable.  Finally, some of the supplementary figures are difficult to interpret without further explanation.


Overall, this is a well-written and impactful paper that makes a valuable contribution to the field of offline reinforcement learning. The proposed framework, LaMo, demonstrates the potential of LLMs in addressing the data limitations inherent in offline RL.  Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further enhance the paper's quality and impact.  I recommend acceptance to the conference, pending minor revisions to clarify certain aspects of the experimental results and further discuss the limitations in relation to existing value-based methods.
