OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the challenging problem of fairness in human decision-making, a crucial area often overshadowed by the focus on algorithmic fairness.  The authors propose a novel approach centered on "relative fairness," comparing decision sets rather than defining absolute fairness standards. This is a significant contribution, as absolute fairness definitions are often context-dependent and contradictory.

The definition of relative fairness as difference parity, using statistical tests (Welch's t-test and Cohen's d) to compare decision differences across sensitive groups, is clear and well-motivated. The authors correctly highlight the subjective nature of absolute fairness measures and the benefits of their relative approach in revealing biases and preferences between decision-makers.

The proposed machine learning-based algorithms, "biased bridge" and "unbiased bridge," are innovative attempts to overcome the limitation of requiring overlapping decisions. These algorithms offer a method for assessing relative fairness even when decisions are made on different datasets for the same task.  The theoretical analysis supporting these algorithms, however, could be strengthened.  The assumptions underlying the methods, especially the independence and identical distribution of errors, need more rigorous justification and discussion of potential violations.

The experimental design is reasonable, utilizing both synthetically biased data and a real-world dataset with human ratings. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed metrics and, to a large extent, the biased bridge algorithm. The authors are transparent about the limitations of their approach.  However, the small number of experimental runs (only one due to computational cost) raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings.  More extensive experimentation, possibly with bootstrapping or cross-validation, is recommended to bolster the conclusions.

While the paper is well-written and the core idea is strong, some areas could be improved.  The discussion of related work could be more comprehensive, incorporating a broader range of perspectives on human bias and fairness beyond the cited studies.  The explanation of the biased bridge algorithm, in particular, could benefit from additional clarity.  Finally, the limitations section accurately points out several shortcomings; addressing these would significantly enhance the paper's impact.  Specifically, expanding the approach to handle continuous sensitive attributes and providing a more robust discussion of the potential for misuse of relative fairness are important next steps.

Overall, this paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of fairness in AI. The innovative concept of relative fairness and the proposed algorithms address a critical need. While some limitations exist, the paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, making it a worthy contribution to ICLR 2024.  Addressing the suggested improvements would strengthen the paper significantly.
