OUTPUT:
This paper presents a novel approach for estimating the mean average precision (mAP) of object detectors on unseen datasets without requiring ground truth labels.  The core idea revolves around the observation that bounding box stability under feature map dropout is strongly correlated with detection accuracy.  The authors propose a Box Stability (BoS) score, calculated using bipartite matching and Intersection over Union (IoU) to quantify this stability.  Their experiments demonstrate a strong positive correlation between BoS score and mAP across various datasets and detector architectures, achieving notably lower root mean squared error (RMSE) in mAP estimation compared to existing label-free evaluation methods.

Strengths:

* Novelty: The connection between bounding box stability and detector generalization is a novel and insightful contribution.  The proposed BoS score offers a practical and unsupervised way to evaluate object detectors in real-world scenarios where ground truth labels are unavailable.
* Strong empirical results: The experiments convincingly show the strong correlation between BoS score and mAP, resulting in significantly improved mAP estimation accuracy compared to baselines.  The leave-one-out cross-validation strategy is appropriate for this task.  The evaluation across multiple datasets and detector architectures strengthens the findings' generalizability.
* Clear presentation: The paper is well-written and easy to follow.  The methodology is clearly explained, and the results are presented in a comprehensive manner.  The supplementary materials provide further details and supporting evidence.

Weaknesses:

* Limited theoretical justification: While the empirical results are strong, the paper lacks a deeper theoretical explanation for the observed correlation between bounding box stability and detection accuracy.  A more in-depth analysis of why this relationship holds could significantly enhance the paper's impact.
* Sensitivity to low mAP scores: The authors acknowledge that the correlation might not hold when the detector's mAP is extremely low. This limitation should be more thoroughly discussed and potentially addressed through further research.  Exploring methods to handle scenarios with many missed detections is crucial.
* Potential for improvement in multi-class detection: The results for multi-class detection are less convincing than those for single-class detection.  Addressing this limitation requires further work, possibly involving more sophisticated methods for handling inter-class feature interference or the acquisition of more diverse multi-class datasets.
* Hyperparameter sensitivity: While a greedy search is used for hyperparameter optimization, a more thorough analysis of hyperparameter sensitivity would be beneficial.  Investigating the robustness of the method to variations in dropout rate and position would further validate its reliability.


Overall:

This paper presents a valuable and timely contribution to the field of object detection. The proposed BoS score provides a promising new tool for unsupervised evaluation of object detectors. While some weaknesses exist, particularly regarding theoretical understanding and limitations in certain scenarios, the overall strength of the empirical evidence and the clear presentation make this a compelling contribution that warrants acceptance at ICLR 2024.  Addressing the suggested weaknesses in future work would further solidify the impact of this research.
