OUTPUT:
This paper tackles an important but under-explored problem in causal discovery: the impact of temporal aggregation on causal inference when the aggregated data appears i.i.d.  The authors convincingly argue that real-world datasets often exhibit this characteristic, yet existing causal discovery methods largely ignore its consequences.  The paper's core contribution lies in its theoretical analysis of the recoverability of causal relations from such aggregated data, distinguishing between functional consistency (relevant for FCM-based methods) and conditional independence consistency (relevant for constraint-based methods).

The theoretical results are rigorous and well-presented, although the proofs for some theorems are relegated to the appendix.  The authors correctly identify the challenges posed by nonlinearity for functional consistency, demonstrating that even in the seemingly favorable linear non-Gaussian case, identifiability is lost as the aggregation factor increases. Their analysis of conditional independence consistency offers valuable insights, showing that partial linearity can be a sufficient condition for maintaining consistency.  The necessary and sufficient conditions presented in Theorem 2 and its corollaries are particularly strong contributions, providing clear criteria for assessing the impact of aggregation.

The simulation experiments are extensive and well-designed, validating the theoretical findings. The inclusion of different causal structures (chain, fork, collider), linear and nonlinear relationships, and variations in the aggregation factor k provides strong support for the paper's claims. The experiments showing the rapid deterioration of performance of FCM-based methods as k increases are particularly compelling. The discussion of the practical implications of the findings is clear and helpful, underscoring the importance of careful consideration when interpreting results from highly aggregated data.  The inclusion of an experiment exploring the effect of the k value and the supplementary experiments examining the impact of adding prior skeletal knowledge are valuable additions to the overall body of evidence.

However, the paper does have limitations. While the negative impact is clearly demonstrated, it lacks a proposed solution beyond the suggestion of using prior knowledge (which is not always available).  Future work could explore methods robust to temporal aggregation or techniques for estimating the appropriate aggregation level. The reliance on the aligned model for a portion of the theoretical analysis, while justified, might be seen as a simplification by some readers.  The paper would also benefit from a more explicit discussion of the practical implications of the conditions derived for conditional independence consistency.  How easily can these conditions be verified in practice? What types of real-world datasets are likely to satisfy these conditions?

Overall, this is a high-quality paper that makes significant contributions to the field of causal discovery.  The theoretical analysis is sound, the empirical results are convincing, and the presentation is clear and well-organized. Despite some limitations, the paper successfully highlights a crucial issue that deserves more attention from the research community.  I recommend acceptance.
