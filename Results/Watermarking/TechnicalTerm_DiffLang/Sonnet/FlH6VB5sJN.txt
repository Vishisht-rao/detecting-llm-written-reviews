Review of "A Parallel Multi-Compartment Spiking Neuron for Multi-Scale Sequential Modeling"

This paper introduces a novel Parallel Multi-compartment Spiking Neuron (PMSN) model for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), aiming to address the limitations of single-compartment models in handling complex temporal dynamics.  The authors argue that their multi-compartment approach, inspired by biological neuron models, allows for better multi-scale sequential modeling and enables parallel training on GPUs, leading to improved accuracy and faster simulation.

Strengths:

* Clear motivation: The paper clearly identifies the limitations of existing SNN models, particularly their struggles with multi-scale temporal dependencies and slow training. The biological inspiration for the PMSN model is well-explained.
* Novel approach: The PMSN model itself is a novel contribution, offering a generalized multi-compartment architecture with parallel training capabilities. The inclusion of the reset mechanism in the parallel implementation is a significant improvement over prior work.
* Comprehensive experiments: The experiments cover a range of sequential modeling tasks, including S-MNIST, PS-MNIST, SHD, and Sequential CIFAR datasets.  The results demonstrate superior accuracy compared to several state-of-the-art models, supporting the claims made by the authors.  The visualization of multi-compartment dynamics provides valuable insights into the model's behavior.
* Detailed methodology: The paper provides a detailed description of the PMSN model's mathematical formulation, its parallel implementation, and the theoretical analysis of gradient propagation.  The authors clearly explain how they address the challenges of parallel training in SNNs.

Weaknesses:

* Limited explanation of certain aspects: While the methodology is detailed, some aspects could benefit from further clarification.  For instance, the specific surrogate gradient used and the details of the parallel prefix sum algorithm implementation are mentioned but not fully explained.  The appendix, although referenced, is not included for review.  This makes it challenging to fully assess the technical soundness of the proposed method.
* Reproducibility concerns: The authors mention making the code publicly available after the review process.  While this is standard practice, the lack of code currently limits the reproducibility of the results.  This is a significant concern for a conference paper.
* Comparison to a broader range of baselines: While the comparison to several state-of-the-art models is strong, including additional baselines, particularly more sophisticated recurrent SNN architectures, would strengthen the paper.

Overall:

The paper presents a promising new SNN model with strong empirical evidence supporting its superior performance in multi-scale sequential modeling.  The parallel implementation is a valuable contribution that addresses a critical limitation of SNNs.  However, the lack of complete methodological details and the absence of publicly available code currently limit the overall assessment.  Addressing these weaknesses, particularly by including the appendix and making the code available, would significantly improve the paper's impact and strengthen its acceptance for ICLR 2024.  A thorough review of the appendix is necessary to assess the technical correctness of the claims regarding gradient propagation and parallel implementation.  Providing more detailed comparison to other recurrent SNN models will improve the paper's evaluation.
