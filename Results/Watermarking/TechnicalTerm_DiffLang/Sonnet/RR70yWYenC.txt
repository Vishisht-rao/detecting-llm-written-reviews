OUTPUT:
This paper introduces continual finite-sum minimization, a novel problem setting for online learning where the goal is to maintain accurate solutions for prefix sums of a sequence of functions.  The authors propose CSVRG, a first-order stochastic variance reduction method designed to efficiently solve this problem.  The theoretical analysis provides a compelling ˜O(n/ϵ^(1/3) + log n/√ϵ) first-order oracle (FO) complexity bound for CSVRG, significantly improving upon existing methods like SGD and state-of-the-art variance reduction techniques.  The lower bound analysis further strengthens the results by showing that the complexity of CSVRG is nearly tight for a class of "natural" first-order methods.

The paper's strengths lie in its clear problem formulation, rigorous theoretical analysis, and significant improvement in computational complexity.  The introduction effectively motivates the continual finite-sum minimization problem and highlights the limitations of existing approaches. The development of CSVRG is well-explained, and the choice of the gradient estimator is justified with insightful lemmas concerning unbiasedness and bounded variance.  The lower bound results provide a strong theoretical foundation for the proposed algorithm's near-optimality.  The experimental results, although limited to ridge regression and a preliminary neural network experiment, provide initial support for the effectiveness of CSVRG.

However, several aspects could be strengthened.  The experimental section could be significantly expanded to include a wider range of datasets and problem types.  The current experiments, while demonstrating the potential benefits of CSVRG, are not extensive enough to fully validate the theoretical claims.  The definition of "natural first-order methods" seems restrictive, and exploring whether this restriction could be relaxed would be beneficial.  Additionally, a deeper discussion of the practical implications of the algorithm, particularly concerning memory usage and implementation challenges, would enhance the paper's overall contribution.  Finally, a more detailed comparison to existing continual learning approaches would provide valuable context.

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes a significant theoretical contribution to the field of online optimization.  While the empirical validation is somewhat limited at this stage, the novelty of the problem setting, the rigorous analysis, and the substantial improvement in complexity make this paper worthy of acceptance.  The authors should focus on expanding the experimental section and further clarifying the limitations of their theoretical framework to enhance the paper's impact.
