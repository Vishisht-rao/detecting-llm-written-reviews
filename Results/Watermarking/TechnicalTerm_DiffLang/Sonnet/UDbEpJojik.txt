OUTPUT:
This paper proposes Fair Collapse (FaCe), a novel transferability estimation metric inspired by the Neural Collapse (NC) phenomenon.  The authors observe a correlation between the NC scores of pre-trained models and their corresponding fine-tuned models, leading them to propose FaCe, which combines a variance collapse term and a class fairness term.  The variance collapse term assesses class separation and within-class compactness, while the class fairness term addresses potential biases towards specific classes by considering the overlap between class distributions.

The paper is well-structured and clearly presents the motivation, method, and experimental results. The proposed FaCe metric is interesting and addresses a relevant problem in transfer learning. The experimental evaluation is extensive, covering various architectures, datasets, and loss functions across image classification, semantic segmentation, and text classification tasks. The results generally demonstrate that FaCe achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to several baselines, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability. The ablation study provides further evidence supporting the contributions of both terms in FaCe.

However, several points could be improved:

The correlation between pre-trained model NC scores and fine-tuned model performance needs stronger justification.  While Figure 1 shows some correlation, a more rigorous statistical analysis (e.g., p-values) would strengthen this claim. The choice of NC metric used in Figure 1 should be explicitly stated and discussed.  The use of a "rough metric" warrants further explanation.

The class fairness term is a creative approach to address potential biases, but the temperature parameter 't' in equation (6) lacks detailed explanation and justification for its chosen value. A sensitivity analysis of the temperature parameter would be beneficial.  Further, the intuition behind using Bhattacharyya coefficient for measuring overlap needs more elaboration.  Why this method is preferable to other distance or similarity measures is not explicitly addressed.

While the experiments are comprehensive, providing more details on the hyperparameter tuning process for both pre-training and fine-tuning would improve reproducibility.   The authors mention using the "best hyperparameters," but specifics are lacking.

Finally, a more in-depth discussion comparing FaCe with NCTI, a concurrent work mentioned in the Related Work section, would be valuable.  Highlighting the key differences and advantages of FaCe over NCTI is crucial.


Overall, this is a strong submission with a novel contribution. Addressing the points mentioned above would significantly strengthen the paper and enhance its impact.  The extensive experiments and clear presentation make this a promising contribution to the field of transferability estimation.
