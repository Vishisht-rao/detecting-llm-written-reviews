OUTPUT:
This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of language model interpretability.  The authors address a critical gap in existing sparse coding approaches by developing novel metrics to rigorously assess the validity of the underlying linearity and sparsity assumptions.  The proposed metrics, average coefficient norm and normalized loss, are shown to be robust and effectively predict sparsity levels in synthetic data, successfully distinguishing between sparse linear and other data distributions.  This rigorous evaluation is a significant strength of the paper.

The application of these metrics to real language model activations provides compelling quantitative evidence supporting the linearity and sparsity hypotheses. The findings regarding the sparsity distribution across layers (highest in initial and final layers, lower in intermediate layers) are insightful and align with intuitive expectations about feature processing in deep networks.  The inclusion of multiple model architectures adds to the generalizability of the results.

The paper is well-structured and clearly written. The methodology is explained in sufficient detail, enabling reproducibility. The inclusion of supplementary materials further strengthens the work, providing a comprehensive analysis and addressing potential concerns.  The examples of interpretable features, though limited, offer a compelling glimpse into the practical utility of the sparse coding approach.

However, some aspects could be improved.  While the synthetic data experiments are thorough, the selection of control datasets for comparison with language models could be expanded to include a wider range of distributions and complexities.  A more in-depth discussion on the limitations of the linearity and sparsity assumptions, and how they might be violated in real-world scenarios, would enhance the paper's impact.  Furthermore, a deeper analysis of the discovered features and their relationship to specific linguistic phenomena would be beneficial.

Despite these minor shortcomings, the paper makes a strong contribution to the field. The proposed metrics offer a much-needed quantitative tool for evaluating sparse coding techniques, pushing the field forward towards more objective and rigorous analysis of language model representations. The findings convincingly support the linearity and sparsity hypotheses, providing valuable insights into the internal workings of language models.  I recommend acceptance to ICLR 2024.
