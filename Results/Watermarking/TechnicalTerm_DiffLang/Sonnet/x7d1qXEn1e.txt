OUTPUT:
This paper introduces Deep Restoration Priors (DRP), a method for solving inverse problems in imaging using pre-trained restoration networks as implicit priors.  The authors extend existing plug-and-play (PnP) methods that utilize denoisers by proposing a framework that accommodates any restoration network, thereby leveraging the power of state-of-the-art models trained for tasks like super-resolution.

The theoretical contribution is significant. The authors provide a convergence analysis under clearly specified assumptions, linking the fixed points of DRP to stationary points of a composite objective function.  This analysis extends previous work by relaxing the assumptions on the prior, allowing for non-smooth data fidelity terms and expansive restoration models.  The generalization to MMSE restoration operators beyond denoisers is a valuable advancement.  The proof details are relegated to the supplement, which should be thoroughly checked.

The empirical results demonstrate DRP's effectiveness on image deblurring and super-resolution tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in many cases. The use of SwinIR as a super-resolution prior is a compelling example, showcasing the method's ability to adapt pre-trained models to different inverse problems.  The inclusion of additional results in the supplement, such as comparisons to other methods and analysis of different hyperparameters, strengthens the findings.  However, a more detailed discussion of hyperparameter tuning, particularly for the step size and regularization parameter, would be beneficial.

The paper is well-written and clearly presents the methodology, theory, and results.  The authors acknowledge limitations, such as the dependence on the quality of pre-trained models and the MMSE assumption.  The discussion of future work, including exploring optimal linear transforms and extending to blind inverse problems, is insightful. The reproducibility statement and inclusion of code are commendable.


Overall, the paper makes a strong contribution to the field of inverse problems in imaging. The theoretical analysis is rigorous and the empirical results are convincing. The generalization from denoiser priors to more general restoration operators is a significant step forward.  However, a careful review of the supplementary materials is necessary to fully assess the validity of the theoretical claims.  Minor improvements in the presentation of hyperparameter tuning would enhance the paper's clarity.
