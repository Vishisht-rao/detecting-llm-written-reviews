OUTPUT:
This paper introduces ColaBO, a novel framework for incorporating user knowledge into Bayesian Optimization (BO).  The core contribution lies in allowing users to specify priors beyond the standard GP kernel, encompassing beliefs about the optimal location, optimal value, and preference relations.  This addresses a significant limitation of traditional BO, where user expertise is often underutilized.

The methodology is clearly presented. The authors effectively demonstrate how user beliefs are translated into a belief-weighted prior over functions, which is then combined with the standard GP prior and updated using Bayes' rule.  The integration with Monte Carlo (MC) acquisition functions is also well-explained, showing how the belief-weighted posterior can be used to compute various acquisition functions like Expected Improvement (EI) and Max-Value Entropy Search (MES).  The use of pathwise updates to maintain scalability is a crucial aspect of the approach.

The experimental results are compelling. The authors convincingly show that ColaBO accelerates optimization when provided with accurate priors, achieving performance comparable to or exceeding existing methods like πBO.  Importantly, they also demonstrate ColaBO's robustness to misleading priors, often recovering to near baseline performance, showcasing a significant advantage over πBO. The experiments on both synthetic and real-world hyperparameter optimization (HPO) tasks provide strong empirical support for the framework's effectiveness.

However, the paper has some limitations. The reliance on MC methods introduces computational overhead, limiting scalability, especially for higher-dimensional priors. The authors acknowledge this and suggest future work to address this issue.  The impact of the RFF approximation, particularly for the Matern kernel, is another point worth emphasizing.  While the authors address the limitations of their approximations, a deeper analysis of the impact of these approximations on the overall performance would strengthen the paper.  Further, a more detailed comparison to other methods that incorporate prior knowledge, perhaps using a more standardized benchmark suite, would be beneficial.

Overall, this is a strong paper that presents a valuable contribution to the field of Bayesian Optimization. The proposed framework addresses a crucial practical issue, effectively integrating user expertise into the optimization process.  While computational cost remains a concern, the authors offer promising directions for future work to mitigate this limitation.  With minor revisions addressing the suggested points, this paper would be suitable for publication at ICLR 2024.
