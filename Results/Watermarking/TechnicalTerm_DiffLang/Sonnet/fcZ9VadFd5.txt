OUTPUT:
This paper presents a theoretical and empirical investigation into the emergent equivariance of deep ensembles under data augmentation.  The core claim—that infinitely wide deep ensembles trained with full data augmentation are equivariant at all training steps, regardless of architecture—is intriguing and potentially impactful.  The authors support this claim with a rigorous proof leveraging neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory.

Strengths:

* Theoretical novelty: The theoretical analysis connecting deep ensembles to emergent equivariance through NTK theory is a significant contribution. The proof is clearly structured and appears sound, although a thorough review by experts in NTK theory is necessary to confirm its correctness.
*  Clear presentation: The paper is well-written and easy to follow, effectively guiding the reader through the theoretical framework and experimental results. The notation is consistent and the explanations are sufficiently detailed.
*  Empirical validation: The authors present empirical results across diverse datasets (Ising model, FashionMNIST, histological slices) and architectures, demonstrating the emergent equivariance even with finite-width networks and a limited number of ensemble members.  The choice of datasets provides a good level of generality.
*  Analysis of limitations: The authors acknowledge and address limitations of their theory, including finite width effects, finite ensemble sizes, and the approximation of continuous groups.  This contributes to the paper's overall robustness.


Weaknesses:

*  Finite width limitations: While the authors acknowledge the finite-width limitations, the quantitative analysis of these limitations is limited.  A more in-depth exploration of how the degree of equivariance degrades with decreasing width would strengthen the conclusions.  Linking the theoretical bounds to the observed empirical deviations would be particularly valuable.
*  Computational cost:  The practical applicability of the findings hinges on the computational cost of training and using large deep ensembles.  A discussion of the scaling properties and potential strategies for mitigating the computational burden would be beneficial.
*  Comparison to alternatives:  While the related work section is thorough, a more direct comparison to alternative methods for achieving equivariance (e.g., manifestly equivariant architectures, data augmentation without ensembles) in terms of performance and efficiency would be valuable.  The brief comparison to canonicalization networks is insufficient.


Overall:

This paper makes a compelling case for the emergent equivariance of deep ensembles. The theoretical contribution is novel and potentially highly significant, while the empirical results provide strong supporting evidence.  Addressing the weaknesses outlined above, particularly a deeper analysis of the finite-width limitations and a more comprehensive comparison to alternative approaches, would significantly improve the paper's impact and contribute to a more complete picture of the proposed phenomenon.  The paper is suitable for publication at ICLR 2024 after addressing these concerns.
