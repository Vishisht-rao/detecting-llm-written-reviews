OUTPUT:
This paper presents a novel prompting-based approach to temporal domain generalization. The authors address the important problem of adapting models to evolving data distributions without access to future data during training.  The proposed method cleverly leverages domain-specific prompts, temporal prompts to capture temporal dynamics, and global prompts to learn general representations.  The framework is parameter-efficient and time-efficient, which is a significant advantage, especially when dealing with large models and datasets.  The experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art baselines.  The inclusion of time series forecasting as a task is also commendable, broadening the applicability beyond standard classification and regression.

However, some aspects could be strengthened. The paper's explanation of the temporal prompt generator could be more detailed.  While the authors mention a single-layer transformer encoder, a more in-depth description of its architecture and hyperparameters would enhance clarity.  The ablation studies, while present, could be more comprehensive.  For example, further ablation on the different prompt types (global, domain-specific, temporal) individually would provide more granular insights into their contribution.  Additionally, a discussion on the limitations of the approach would strengthen the paper.  Are there specific types of temporal drifts that the method struggles with?  How sensitive is the performance to the choice of the pre-trained backbone?  Addressing these limitations would provide a more balanced perspective.

The synthetic data generation process is described, but visualizing this data would improve understanding.  Similarly, more detailed visualizations of the learned prompts could be insightful.  Finally, while the authors mention that the code will be shared,  it is crucial to explicitly state its availability at the time of review,  providing the link to the repository.

Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of temporal domain generalization. The proposed method is innovative, parameter-efficient, and demonstrates strong empirical performance.  However, addressing the suggested improvements would further enhance the clarity, completeness, and impact of the paper.  The paper is well-written and the contributions are significant enough to warrant acceptance, provided the authors address the points raised in this review.
