OUTPUT:
This paper introduces GECO, a novel graph neural network architecture designed to address the quadratic complexity limitations of Graph Transformers (GTs) while maintaining or improving upon their predictive performance.  The authors propose replacing the self-attention mechanism in GTs with a combination of shallow neighborhood propagation and global convolutions, inspired by recent advances in efficient sequence modeling.

The paper is well-written and clearly structured. The background section provides a comprehensive overview of GNNs and GTs, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.  The proposed GECO architecture is described in detail, with clear explanations of its components and their interactions.  The authors' claims regarding GECO's efficiency and effectiveness are supported by extensive experimental results on a diverse range of benchmark datasets, including both small-scale and large-scale graphs.  The improvements over state-of-the-art GTs are significant, particularly for large graphs where traditional GTs often fail due to memory limitations.

The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the design choices made in GECO.  The comparison with Hyena, while not a direct apples-to-apples comparison,  demonstrates the adaptation of the global convolution idea to the graph domain and highlights the contribution of the proposed modifications.  The permutation sensitivity analysis is also a crucial contribution, acknowledging a limitation of the model and highlighting directions for future research.

However, a few aspects could be strengthened.  The paper mentions several "appendices" containing details on datasets, algorithms, and complexity analysis, but their content is not provided.  Including at least some of this critical information within the main body of the paper would improve its completeness and readability. The discussion of the relationship to JK-Nets in Appendix E.4 seems somewhat tangential to the main contribution and could possibly be shortened or removed.  A more detailed discussion of the computational trade-offs between different components of GECO and their impact on overall performance would be beneficial.  The explanation of the "graph-to-sequence conversion" in the Global Context Block could benefit from more clarity and illustrations.  Finally, the connection between the hyperparameter choices and the achieved performance warrants more discussion.

Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of graph representation learning. GECO demonstrates a promising approach to scaling GTs to large graphs without sacrificing predictive quality.  Addressing the minor concerns mentioned above would further enhance the paper's impact and clarity.  I recommend acceptance, pending the inclusion of the appendix details.
