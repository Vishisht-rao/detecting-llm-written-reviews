OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the under-explored problem of predictive uncertainty calibration in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA).  The authors propose Pseudo-Calibration (PseudoCal), a novel post-hoc calibration framework that avoids the limitations of existing methods which rely on importance weighting and additional model training.  The core idea is to synthesize a labeled pseudo-target dataset using inference-stage mixup and leverage this to perform temperature scaling.  This reframes the problem as a target-domain-specific unsupervised problem rather than a covariate shift problem.

The paper's strengths lie in its clear identification of a significant problem, its innovative solution, and the comprehensive experimental evaluation. The authors convincingly demonstrate PseudoCal's superior performance across five diverse UDA scenarios and ten UDA methods, consistently outperforming established baselines. The theoretical analysis, grounded in the cluster assumption, provides an intuitive explanation for the method's effectiveness, although further formal justification might strengthen this aspect. The ablation study thoroughly examines different pseudo-target synthesis strategies, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed inference-stage mixup approach.  The inclusion of reliability diagrams and a detailed algorithm description enhances reproducibility.

However, some weaknesses need addressing.  The reliance on the cluster assumption, while intuitively appealing, is a limitation. The paper should discuss scenarios where this assumption might fail and explore potential robustness strategies.  The sensitivity analysis of the mix ratio lambda is helpful, but a more thorough exploration of hyperparameter settings might be beneficial.  While the authors address the limitations of existing methods, a more detailed comparison on a per-task basis rather than just averaged results would provide a more granular understanding of PseudoCal's performance advantages.  Finally, although the reproducibility statement is encouraging, the lack of readily available code at the time of review is a minor drawback.

Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of UDA. The proposed PseudoCal method offers a simple, effective, and relatively general solution to the challenging problem of calibration in UDA.  The comprehensive experiments and clear writing make this paper a strong contribution, though addressing the suggested weaknesses would further strengthen its impact.  I recommend acceptance, pending minor revisions to address the aforementioned points.
