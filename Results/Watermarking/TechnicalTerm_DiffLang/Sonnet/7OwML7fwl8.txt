OUTPUT:
This paper tackles the important problem of achieving fairness in machine learning models without access to sensitive attributes.  The authors present a novel approach, Reckoner, which uses a confidence-based data splitting strategy combined with a dual-model system and learnable noise.  The core idea is leveraging the observation that low-confidence predictions often exhibit better fairness, even at the cost of accuracy.  Reckoner aims to transfer this fairness knowledge from a low-confidence model to a high-confidence model, while maintaining overall predictive performance using learnable noise to focus the model on essential predictive information.

The paper's strengths include:

* A clear and well-defined problem statement addressing a significant challenge in fairness research.
* A novel approach that combines several interesting techniques (confidence-based splitting, dual-model system, learnable noise).
* A thorough experimental evaluation on two benchmark datasets, including a comparison to relevant baselines and an ablation study.
*  A relatively clear explanation of the proposed methodology, though some aspects of the dual-model interaction could benefit from further clarification.


However, there are also some weaknesses:

* The motivation for using learnable noise could be strengthened. While the intuition is presented, a more formal justification or theoretical analysis would be beneficial.  The explanation of how learnable noise "neutralizes" unfairness lacks detail.
* The paper lacks a formal definition of fairness. While the metrics used (Equalised Odds and Demographic Parity) are stated, a clear definition of the fairness goal itself would improve clarity.
* The ablation study, while present, could be more comprehensive.  For example, exploring different confidence thresholds or variations in the dual-model interaction parameters would provide a more robust understanding of the contributions of each component.
*  The choice of a linear classifier for the initial confidence estimation seems somewhat arbitrary.  The impact of this choice on the overall performance should be discussed.
* The paper mentions that the Low-Conf generator is trained for only three epochs, but the rationale behind this specific number is missing. Justification is needed.
* While the paper compares to several baselines, a broader comparison with more recent and relevant methods would further strengthen the paper's contribution.


Overall, the paper presents an interesting and potentially valuable contribution to the field of fair machine learning.  The proposed method shows promising results, but some theoretical and experimental gaps remain.  Addressing the weaknesses mentioned above, particularly providing a stronger theoretical foundation for the learnable noise and a more comprehensive ablation study, would significantly improve the paper.  A clearer explanation of the interactions within the dual-model system is also needed. With these improvements, this paper would be suitable for ICLR 2024.
