OUTPUT:
This paper introduces VLB-IRL, a novel variational inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithm.  The authors derive a variational lower bound on the likelihood of the reward function given expert trajectories, framing the problem within a probabilistic graphical model.  This model explicitly includes an optimality node, allowing for a principled derivation of the lower bound which involves minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence between an approximated distribution of optimality and the true distribution.  The resulting algorithm simultaneously learns the reward function and a policy under that reward.

The paper's strengths lie in its theoretical contributions. The probabilistic graphical model provides a clear and intuitive framework for IRL, and the derivation of the variational lower bound is well-presented. The authors convincingly argue for the advantages of using reverse KL divergence, particularly its robustness to noisy expert trajectories.  The empirical results on several MuJoCo benchmark environments and the more challenging Assistive Gym environment demonstrate improved performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially in scenarios with noisy data.  The inclusion of both continuous and discrete control tasks strengthens the evaluation. The ablation study on the number of expert trajectories highlights the sample efficiency of the approach.

However, there are aspects that could be improved. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the approximation made in representing the distribution of optimality. While the authors mention a bounded approximation error, a deeper analysis of the tightness of this bound and its impact on the overall performance would strengthen the argument.  The choice of hyperparameters is crucial in adversarial methods. A more extensive hyperparameter search and sensitivity analysis would be beneficial.  Furthermore, while the authors claim robustness to noisy trajectories, a more formal analysis comparing the performance under varying levels of noise would further solidify this claim.  Finally, clarifying the computational complexity of VLB-IRL in comparison to existing methods would be helpful.

The presentation of the results is clear, and the tables and figures are well-designed and informative. The related work section adequately covers relevant literature, properly placing VLB-IRL within the existing landscape of IRL algorithms.

Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of IRL.  The proposed framework and algorithm are novel, well-motivated, and demonstrate promising empirical results.  Addressing the points mentioned above would further enhance the paper's impact and strengthen its conclusions.  I recommend acceptance pending minor revisions.
