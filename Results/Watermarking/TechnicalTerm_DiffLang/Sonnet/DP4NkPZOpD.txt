OUTPUT:
This paper presents OMNIPROT, a novel generative model for protein design that jointly learns protein sequence and three-dimensional structure using a latent diffusion model.  The approach uses a roto-translational invariant autoencoder to create a latent space where a diffusion model operates, enabling conditional generation for various tasks such as inverse folding and protein-protein docking.

Strengths:

The unified approach to addressing multiple protein design tasks is a significant contribution.  The ability of a single model to handle inverse folding and protein docking effectively demonstrates the power of jointly modeling sequence and structure.  The paper's experimental results show state-of-the-art performance in protein-protein docking and competitive results in inverse folding, which is impressive. The proposed new protein-protein docking dataset addresses data leakage issues present in previous benchmarks, strengthening the validity of the results. The analysis of OMNIPROT's properties, demonstrating rotational invariance, is valuable.  The ablation study comparing OMNIPROT to a sequence-only variant highlights the benefit of the joint modeling approach.


Weaknesses:

The paper could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the autoencoder architecture and training process. Appendix A provides some details, but a more thorough description in the main body would improve clarity. The choice of features for the model could be further justified. While the authors mention using features from DockGPT, a deeper discussion of feature selection and its impact on performance would be beneficial.  The comparison to baselines is mainly focused on oracle scores for diffusion models. While this allows for a fairer comparison in terms of the number of samples, a more thorough comparison considering all sampled structures would strengthen the claims.  The discussion of the relationship between the autoencoder's reconstruction accuracy and OMNIPROT's performance on design tasks is promising, but requires more in-depth analysis.  Finally, some qualitative analysis of the generated protein structures would enhance the paper, showing the quality and diversity of generated structures.


Overall:

This is a strong paper with a promising approach to protein design. The unified model is a significant advancement, and the experimental results are compelling.  Addressing the weaknesses mentioned above, particularly providing a more detailed explanation of the architecture and a more comprehensive comparison to baselines, would further strengthen the paper and enhance its impact. The work presents a valuable contribution to the field and warrants acceptance to the conference.
