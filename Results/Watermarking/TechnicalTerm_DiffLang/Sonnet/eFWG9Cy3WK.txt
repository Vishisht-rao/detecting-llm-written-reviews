OUTPUT:
This paper tackles the memory inefficiency and redundancy issues in Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) models.  The authors propose MC-SMoE, a novel framework that merges and then compresses experts based on routing statistics.  The core idea is to leverage the activation frequencies of experts to guide the merging process, prioritizing dominant experts and grouping less-utilized experts with their most similar counterparts.  The merging step is further enhanced by a weight permutation alignment to improve the quality of the fusion.  Interestingly, the authors observe that the merging process inherently reduces the dimensionality of the expert weight space, allowing for additional compression using low-rank decomposition and structural sparsity.

The paper is well-structured and clearly presents the methodology.  The proposed MC-SMoE framework is innovative and addresses a significant challenge in the field.  The extensive experiments across eight benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, achieving up to 80% memory reduction and 20% FLOPs reduction with minimal performance loss.  The ablation studies provide valuable insights into different design choices, such as the adaptive layer-wise merging ratio and the use of router logits for expert similarity.  The visualization of the compression effect further strengthens the claims of the paper.

However, some aspects could be improved. The discussion on latency is somewhat limited, despite the acknowledged challenges in achieving latency gains with SMoE.  While the authors demonstrate latency improvements with a specialized inference implementation, a more detailed analysis and comparison with other efficient SMoE methods would be beneficial.  The claim that the merging promotes low dimensionality is interesting but could benefit from a more theoretical justification or deeper analysis.  The reproducibility statement is good, but including more precise details about the hardware and software environment used for the experiments would further enhance reproducibility.

Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of efficient deep learning.  The proposed MC-SMoE framework offers a promising solution to address the scalability issues of SMoE models, and the empirical results are convincing.  The paper is well-written and easy to follow, and the ablation studies provide a thorough evaluation of the proposed method. With some minor improvements to the discussion of latency and a deeper theoretical analysis of the dimensionality reduction, this paper is suitable for publication at ICLR 2024.
