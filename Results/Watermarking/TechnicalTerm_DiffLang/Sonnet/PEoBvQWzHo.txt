OUTPUT:
This paper tackles the important problem of uncertainty quantification in personalized federated learning.  The authors propose a novel framework that intelligently switches between a global and a personalized model based on uncertainty estimates, aiming to improve prediction accuracy, especially in the presence of out-of-distribution data.

The core idea of using uncertainty to guide model selection is sound and addresses a critical limitation of existing personalized federated learning approaches. The use of Dirichlet-based posterior networks, specifically a modified version of NatPN, is a clever choice, enabling efficient estimation of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.  The identification and proposed solution for a previously unknown issue in the NatPN loss function is a valuable contribution, adding to the methodological novelty of the paper.

The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, using several real-world datasets and comparing against a range of state-of-the-art personalized federated learning algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed FedPN method performs competitively on in-distribution data while significantly outperforming other methods on mixed and out-of-distribution data.  This highlights the effectiveness of the proposed switching mechanism.

However, some aspects require further clarification and improvement.  The threshold selection procedure, while acknowledging its subjectivity, could benefit from a more robust and less heuristic approach.  Exploring alternative methods for threshold selection or providing a more formal justification for the chosen method would strengthen the paper.  Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the computational overhead of the proposed method, particularly in comparison to the simpler FedAvg algorithm. While some discussion exists in the appendix, a more prominent presentation in the main text would be helpful.

Finally, while the paper acknowledges the limitations of the method,  a more thorough discussion of the potential failure cases and their implications would be beneficial.  For instance, what happens if both the local and global models exhibit high uncertainty?  How sensitive is the performance to the choice of hyperparameters (λ and γ)?  Addressing these points would further enhance the paper's rigor.

Overall, this is a well-written and promising paper that makes significant contributions to the field of federated learning. The proposed framework is innovative, the experimental evaluation is thorough, and the identification of the loss function issue is a valuable contribution.  Addressing the minor weaknesses mentioned above would further improve the paper's impact.  I recommend acceptance, pending minor revisions.
