OUTPUT:
This paper presents a novel approach to improve the efficiency of estimating sliced Wasserstein (SW) distances using control variates.  The authors address a significant limitation in the existing literature, namely the lack of variance reduction techniques for SW distance estimation.  Their proposed method cleverly leverages Gaussian approximations of projected one-dimensional measures and utilizes the closed-form Wasserstein-2 distance between Gaussian distributions to construct computationally efficient control variates.  The use of both upper and lower bounds as control variates is a particularly insightful contribution.

The paper is well-structured and clearly written. The background section provides a concise and helpful overview of Wasserstein distances, their special cases, and the SW distance estimation via Monte Carlo integration.  The theoretical contributions are clearly presented, with proofs provided in the appendix. The authors convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed control variate estimators through comprehensive experiments on image and point cloud data.  The empirical results show a considerable reduction in variance and error compared to the conventional SW estimator, particularly for the lower bound control variate.  Furthermore, the application to gradient flows and deep generative modeling showcases the practical benefits of the proposed method, leading to improved performance in these tasks with minimal increase in computational cost.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The theoretical analysis focuses primarily on the variance reduction aspect. A more in-depth discussion of the bias introduced by the Gaussian approximation and its impact on the overall estimation accuracy would strengthen the paper.  While the authors mention the asymptotic unbiasedness of their estimator, a more rigorous analysis of the bias and its convergence rate would be beneficial.  Additionally, a more detailed comparison with other variance reduction techniques for Monte Carlo integration, beyond simply stating that no prior work exists on variance reduction for SW distances, would provide valuable context.  Finally, the experiments, while comprehensive, could be further strengthened by including a sensitivity analysis to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of projections L.

Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of optimal transport and its applications in machine learning. The proposed control variate estimators for SW distances are novel, computationally efficient, and demonstrably effective.  The paper is well-written and the experimental results are convincing.  With minor additions to address the points raised above, this paper would be suitable for publication at ICLR 2024.
