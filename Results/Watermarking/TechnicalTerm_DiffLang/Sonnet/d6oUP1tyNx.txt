OUTPUT:
This paper tackles the important problem of evaluating probabilistic multivariate time series forecasting models.  The authors correctly identify the limitations of existing metrics like CRPS, CRPS-Sum, and MSIS, highlighting their inability to capture inter-series and inter-temporal dependencies.  The discussion of the Energy and Variogram scores, including their respective shortcomings, provides a valuable context for the proposed method.

The core contribution is the k-Nearest Neighbor Score (KNNS), a novel metric based on density estimation using random projections to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.  The theoretical connection established between the Energy Score and the average CRPS over random projections is insightful and strengthens the motivation for the proposed approach.  The paper clearly explains the KNNS algorithm and its computational complexity.

The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, including both synthetic and real-world datasets. The use of synthetic data with controlled variations (mean, variance, correlation) allows for a systematic assessment of the metric's discrimination ability.  The authors thoughtfully employ established evaluation methodologies from prior work, ensuring a fair comparison with existing metrics. The analysis of results, using the DSc and DSa scores, provides a clear quantitative comparison across different parameter settings.  The application to real-world datasets and deep learning models further strengthens the paper's empirical support.

However, several aspects could be improved.  The discussion of parameter selection for KNNS (k and d) is somewhat brief.  Providing more detailed guidance on how to choose these parameters optimally, perhaps through cross-validation or other techniques, would strengthen the paper.  The impact of the number of random projections (NRP) should be discussed more extensively.  A sensitivity analysis with varying NRP would demonstrate the robustness of the metric.  Finally, the comparison to the logarithmic score, mentioned briefly in section 3, could be expanded.  A direct comparison, where applicable, would add further weight to the KNNS's justification.

Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field.  The proposed KNNS score addresses a critical gap in the evaluation of probabilistic multivariate time series forecasting, offering a more comprehensive assessment of model performance. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the new metric.  Addressing the minor shortcomings mentioned above will further improve the paper's impact and clarity.  I recommend acceptance, pending minor revisions.
