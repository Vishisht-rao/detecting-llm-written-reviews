OUTPUT:
This paper presents Keqing, a framework for knowledge-based question answering (KBQA) that leverages large language models (LLMs).  The core idea is to use a knowledge graph and predefined question templates to decompose complex questions into simpler sub-questions, retrieve relevant information, reason over the retrieved knowledge, and finally generate an answer along with the reasoning path.  This approach aims to mitigate the "hallucination" problem often observed in LLMs.

The paper is well-structured and clearly presents the proposed methodology. The four-stage pipeline (Question Decomposition, Knowledge Retrieval, Candidate Reasoning, Response Generation) is logically sound and well-explained.  The use of question templates as an intermediary step between the complex question and the knowledge graph is a particularly interesting contribution, potentially making the process more interpretable for the LLM.  The utilization of existing knowledge graph reasoning paths as chain-of-thought (CoT) mentors is novel and offers a compelling approach to automated CoT generation.

The experimental results on MetaQA and WebQSP show competitive performance compared to existing methods, particularly in achieving state-of-the-art results on MetaQA. The inclusion of a case study visually demonstrates Keqing's capabilities on various question types and levels of complexity.  The ablation study provides valuable insights into the impact of key design choices, such as the decomposition strategy and the number of retrieved question templates.

However, some aspects require further clarification and analysis. The paper mentions using LORA for fine-tuning LLMs, but details on the training data, hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics for this fine-tuning process are missing.  More detailed information on the knowledge graph structure and the methodology for collecting and selecting logical chains would also enhance the paper's clarity and reproducibility.

The reliance on predefined question templates might limit the framework's generalizability to unseen question types.  The paper should address this limitation and discuss potential methods for expanding the template set or adapting to new question structures.  Furthermore, a deeper analysis of failure cases and a discussion of potential strategies for handling such failures would strengthen the paper's contribution.  The runtime and memory complexity analysis is limited and should be expanded.

In summary, this paper presents a promising framework for KBQA. The novel approach of using knowledge graph logical chains as CoT mentors, combined with the use of question templates, is a significant contribution.  However, the paper needs to address some of the mentioned limitations and provide more detailed experimental information to fully convince the reader of its impact.  Addressing these points would significantly improve the paper's quality and its suitability for publication at ICLR 2024.
