OUTPUT:
This paper tackles the important problem of shortcut learning in deep neural networks, proposing a novel method for detecting shortcuts using mutual information (MI) estimated via the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK).  The core idea is that models relying on spurious correlations will exhibit lower MI between the learned representation and the input space on out-of-distribution (OOD) data compared to in-distribution data.

The paper is well-structured and clearly presents the methodology. The use of NTK provides a tractable way to estimate MI, a significant advantage given the challenges of MI estimation in high-dimensional spaces. The experimental evaluation is extensive, covering a range of datasets with both synthetic and naturally occurring shortcuts.  The comparison against OOD detection baselines convincingly demonstrates the unique contribution of the proposed method, highlighting its ability to detect shortcuts where traditional OOD detectors fail. The application to medical datasets is particularly relevant and showcases the practical potential of the approach.

However, there are some points that could be strengthened.  The reliance on NTK, while providing tractability, limits the applicability to infinite-width networks.  Discussion of how the method might be extended to finite-width networks, perhaps through alternative MI estimation techniques, would be beneficial.  The paper mentions the limitation of not detecting reverse spurious correlations; further discussion on this limitation and potential mitigation strategies would improve the completeness of the work.  While the experiments are comprehensive, a more rigorous statistical analysis of the results would strengthen the claims.  Finally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the computational cost of the proposed method, especially in comparison to other shortcut detection approaches.

Overall, this paper presents a valuable contribution to the field. The proposed method is novel, well-motivated, and effectively evaluated.  Addressing the points mentioned above would further enhance the impact and robustness of the work.  The paper is suitable for acceptance at ICLR 2024, subject to minor revisions.
