OUTPUT:
This paper introduces AutoDAN, a novel method for generating interpretable adversarial attacks against large language models (LLMs).  The authors address a significant limitation of previous adversarial attack methods, namely the generation of unintelligible prompts easily filtered by perplexity-based defenses. AutoDAN generates readable prompts that maintain a high attack success rate, even after applying these filters. This is a valuable contribution, as it highlights the vulnerability of LLMs to more sophisticated, human-like attacks.

The paper is well-structured and clearly written. The authors effectively explain the technical details of AutoDAN, including the two-step optimization process and the method for balancing jailbreaking and readability objectives.  The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoDAN in bypassing perplexity filters and achieving high attack success rates across different LLMs, both white-box and black-box.  The analysis of the generated prompts reveals interesting strategies that mirror those used in manual jailbreaks, providing insights into the mechanisms behind these attacks.  The extension of AutoDAN to the task of leaking system prompts is also a noteworthy contribution, showcasing the broader implications of interpretable adversarial attacks.

However, there are some areas that could be strengthened.  The reliance on a single, somewhat arbitrary metric (the prompt starting with a refusal) for evaluating attack success is a limitation.  While the authors acknowledge this and supplement it with GPT-4 evaluations, further validation using alternative metrics or human evaluation would bolster the findings.  The hyperparameter tuning process could be described in more detail, possibly including a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the results to changes in hyperparameter values.  Finally, a more thorough discussion of the ethical implications of this work would be beneficial, given the potential for misuse of the proposed technique.  The ethical statement provided is brief and could be substantially expanded.

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of LLM security.  The proposed method is novel, well-evaluated, and offers valuable insights into the vulnerabilities of LLMs to interpretable adversarial attacks.  Addressing the minor weaknesses suggested above would further enhance the paper's impact.  I recommend acceptance, pending minor revisions.
