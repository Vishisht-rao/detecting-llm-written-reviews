OUTPUT:
This paper investigates the relative merits of independent (IDR) and simultaneous (SDR) dimensionality reduction techniques for multimodal data.  The authors utilize a generative linear model to synthesize datasets with controllable noise, self-signals, and shared signals, allowing for a rigorous comparison of PCA (IDR) and PLS/CCA/rCCA (SDR).  The experiments systematically vary sample size, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the number of self and shared signals.

The results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of linear SDR methods, particularly regularized CCA (rCCA), over linear IDR methods in recovering shared signals, especially in the challenging undersampled regime where the number of samples is smaller than the dimensionality of the data.  The authors effectively quantify reconstruction quality using a metric corrected for sampling bias, providing a clear and compelling visual presentation of their findings.  The analysis highlights the influence of the relative strengths of shared and self signals, the ratio of their numbers, and the samples-per-dimension ratio on the performance of both IDR and SDR methods.  rCCA shows remarkable robustness across diverse parameter settings, consistently achieving near-perfect reconstruction.

A key strength of the work lies in its controlled experimental setup and clear methodology. The use of a generative model enables a precise understanding of the impact of different factors on dimensionality reduction performance.  The extension to a Noisy MNIST dataset adds credibility to the findings, suggesting that the observed advantages of SDR are not limited to the specific linear Gaussian model.

However, the paper could be strengthened by addressing some limitations. The reliance on a linear generative model, while allowing for controlled experiments, restricts the generality of the conclusions.  While the Noisy MNIST extension is a positive step, exploring additional nonlinear datasets with varying complexities would further solidify the claims.  A more detailed discussion of the regularization parameters used in rCCA and their sensitivity to the data characteristics would be beneficial.  Finally, while the Frobenius norm of the correlation matrix is a reasonable metric, exploring alternative metrics (e.g., mutual information) might offer a more complete picture, especially in the context of nonlinear relationships.

Despite these minor limitations, the paper makes a significant contribution by providing strong empirical evidence for the superiority of SDR over IDR in recovering shared signals from multimodal data, particularly in undersampled scenarios.  The findings offer valuable practical guidance for researchers dealing with high-dimensional multimodal datasets and contribute meaningfully to the ongoing discussion surrounding dimensionality reduction techniques.  The paper is well-written and clearly presented, and I recommend its acceptance to the conference.
