OUTPUT:
This paper introduces novel evaluation metrics for generative models that focus on the interpretability of attribute distributions.  The authors propose Single-attribute Divergence (SaD) and Paired-attribute Divergence (PaD) to quantify discrepancies between generated and training images in terms of individual and paired attribute strengths, respectively.  They enhance CLIPScore with Heterogeneous CLIPScore (HCS) to improve the accuracy of attribute strength measurement.

The core idea of using attribute-based metrics to provide more insightful evaluations is compelling and addresses a significant limitation of existing metrics like FID.  The proposed metrics offer a valuable level of interpretability, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of model strengths and weaknesses. The visualizations in Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 effectively communicate the concept and the advantages of the proposed approach.  The experimental results, particularly the biased data injection experiment (Section 5.1) and the comparison of different generative models (Section 5.3), demonstrate the effectiveness of SaD and PaD in capturing attribute distribution differences that are missed by traditional metrics.  The ablation studies in Section 5.5 provide useful insights into the robustness of the metrics with respect to sample size and the number of attributes. The analysis of different model types and versions highlights interesting model-specific behaviors related to attribute generation.

However, some aspects require further clarification and improvement.  The reliance on CLIP and the quality of attribute detection (discussed in the conclusion) represents a potential weakness.  The accuracy of attribute identification from captions or user annotations directly impacts the reliability of SaD and PaD.  While the paper acknowledges this, a more detailed analysis of the impact of different attribute extraction methods and potential biases would strengthen the argument.  The authors should also elaborate on the computational cost of the proposed metrics compared to existing methods.  The discussion of limitations in the conclusion is helpful but could be more specific and potentially address issues such as the selection of appropriate attributes for different datasets and tasks.

The presentation could also be improved.  Some sections are dense and could benefit from a clearer structure. The descriptions of SaD and PaD, while technically sound, could be more concise and accessible to a broader audience. The appendix contains many supplementary tables and figures that should be carefully integrated into the main text where appropriate to enhance clarity and impact.

Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of generative model evaluation.  The proposed metrics offer a promising approach to improve interpretability and provide a more comprehensive understanding of model performance.  With some revisions addressing the aforementioned points, the paper would be suitable for publication.
