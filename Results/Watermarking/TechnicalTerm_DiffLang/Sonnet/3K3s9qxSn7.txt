OUTPUT:
This paper makes a novel contribution by framing the representation complexity of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms within the context of circuit complexity.  The authors theoretically demonstrate a class of MDPs (Majority MDPs) where the transition and reward functions have constant-depth, polynomial-size circuit representations, while the optimal Q-function requires exponential size. This rigorously supports the intuition that model-based methods might enjoy better sample complexity than model-free methods due to differences in representation complexity of the learned quantities.

The theoretical analysis is a significant strength, offering a more fundamental and rigorous approach compared to prior work that relied on less general metrics like the number of linear pieces. The introduction of circuit complexity to RL is a valuable contribution, potentially opening new avenues of research.  The definition of Majority MDPs, while potentially restrictive, allows for a clear demonstration of the theoretical result. The careful consideration of the control function and the condition function within the Majority MDP framework adds nuance and realism to the model.

The empirical results, while supportive of the theory, are limited in scope.  The experiments focus on a specific set of MuJoCo environments and neural network architectures.  A broader range of environments and function approximators would strengthen the conclusions and demonstrate the generality of the observed phenomenon.  The authors acknowledge this limitation.  Furthermore, the use of relative approximation errors, while helping to normalize across different quantities, requires careful interpretation.  The dependence on a pre-trained SAC agent to generate trajectories could introduce bias.

The related work section is thorough, clearly positioning the paper's contributions within the existing literature.  The notations are well-defined, enhancing the clarity of the theoretical sections.  The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

Overall, this paper presents a significant theoretical contribution to our understanding of the representation complexity in RL.  The introduction of circuit complexity is a particularly noteworthy advance.  However, the empirical validation could benefit from greater breadth and depth to solidify the claim of widespread applicability.  The paper would benefit from a more thorough discussion of the limitations of the Majority MDP framework and its potential extensions to more complex MDPs.  Despite these minor limitations, the paper is a valuable addition to the field and warrants acceptance.
