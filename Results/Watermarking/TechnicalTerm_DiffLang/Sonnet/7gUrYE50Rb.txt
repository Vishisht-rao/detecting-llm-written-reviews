OUTPUT:
This paper presents EQA-MX, a novel large-scale dataset for embodied question answering (EQA) tasks incorporating multimodal expressions (verbal utterances and nonverbal gestures).  The authors address a significant limitation in existing VQA and EQA datasets: the lack of nonverbal cues and multiple perspectives.  The creation of EQA-MX, using an extended CAESAR simulator, is a substantial contribution.  The dataset includes 8 new EQA tasks, each with variations, resulting in over 8 million samples.  The diversity in question length, verbal perspectives, and object locations is highlighted, suggesting a reduction in perspective bias.

The proposed VQ-Fusion model is a well-motivated approach to address the challenge of fusing continuous visual and discrete verbal representations.  The use of vector quantization with shared codebooks to align multiview representations is innovative and seems effective in improving performance. The paper presents a comprehensive experimental analysis comparing VQ-Fusion with several state-of-the-art visual-language models.  The results demonstrate consistent performance improvements across various EQA tasks, with gains up to 13%, which is significant.  Ablation studies exploring the impact of nonverbal gestures and the number of codebooks further solidify the model's effectiveness.

However, some aspects could be strengthened.  The paper mentions multiple times that supplementary materials provide more detail, which weakens the main paper itself. Crucial details about the dataset generation process, task sub-templates, and model architectures should be included in the main body for better clarity and self-containment.  While the ablation studies are valuable, a more in-depth analysis of the reasons behind the optimal number of codebooks for different tasks would be beneficial.  For example, a qualitative analysis correlating task complexity with codebook size would be insightful.  Finally, the comparison to related datasets (Table 9) could be improved by using a consistent set of features for comparison across all datasets, making the analysis more objective and easier to interpret.

Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of embodied question answering. The creation of EQA-MX and the proposed VQ-Fusion model address important limitations of existing approaches.  The experimental results are compelling and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.  However, the paper would benefit from expanding on some crucial details currently relegated to supplementary materials and providing a more rigorous analysis of some experimental results.  With these improvements, the paper would be a stronger contribution to ICLR 2024.
