OUTPUT:
This paper presents BTR, a novel approach to accelerate inference in retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) while significantly reducing storage requirements. The core idea is to precompute and store 1-bit binary token representations for passages, thereby drastically reducing the computational burden during inference.  The authors address the potential accuracy loss associated with binarization through careful calibration techniques and the introduction of novel training objectives: a passage representation recovery objective and a query-aware passage token distillation objective.  Further efficiency gains are achieved through offline and runtime compression techniques, leveraging redundancy in the retrieved passages.

The paper is well-structured and clearly explains the proposed method. The experimental results on five knowledge-intensive NLP tasks demonstrate significant improvements in inference speed (up to 4x) and storage reduction (over 100x) compared to several strong baselines, including Atlas, a state-of-the-art RALM.  The authors maintain over 95% of the original model's performance in many cases, showcasing a compelling efficiency-accuracy trade-off.  The ablation study provides valuable insights into the contribution of each component of BTR, highlighting the effectiveness of both the calibration and compression strategies.

However, a few points could strengthen the paper:

The discussion on the limitations of extending BTR to decoder-only readers is somewhat brief.  A more in-depth analysis of the challenges and potential solutions would be beneficial.  Similarly, the discussion of scalability to larger models and longer queries could be expanded, providing more concrete proposals for future work.

While the comparison to baselines is thorough, including more recent and competitive RALM architectures would strengthen the paper's conclusions. The choice of only 4-bit quantization for Atlas-Q might not fully represent the state-of-the-art in quantization techniques.

The paper mentions using a bipartite merging algorithm for offline token compression. A more detailed explanation of this algorithm and its computational complexity, especially in the context of billions of tokens, would be helpful.  Furthermore, a more thorough comparison to other clustering methods would aid in justifying the choice of the bipartite method.

Finally, the reproducibility of the results could be improved by providing more detailed information on the hardware and software environment used for the experiments.

Despite these minor shortcomings, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of efficient RALM inference. The proposed BTR method offers a promising approach to address the scalability challenges associated with these models, making them more practical for real-world applications.  The clear presentation, strong empirical results, and insightful ablation study make this paper a worthwhile contribution to the ICLR 2024 conference.
