OUTPUT:
This paper introduces Rapper, a two-stage framework for generating Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) in Visual Question Answering (VQA).  The core idea is to leverage large language models (LLMs) for knowledge distillation to create plausible rationales, followed by reinforcement learning from NLE feedback (RLNF) to ensure faithfulness to the visual input.  The authors address the common problems of implausibility and hallucination in VQA-NLE.

The paper is well-structured and clearly presents the proposed method. The two-stage approach is logical and addresses the limitations of existing methods.  The use of knowledge distillation from LLMs is a strong contribution, offering a way to incorporate factual knowledge without requiring ground-truth rationales. The RLNF stage is also innovative, using answer-explanation feedback as a reward signal to improve the alignment between the generated rationales and the visual context.

The experimental results demonstrate that Rapper achieves state-of-the-art performance on two VQA-NLE benchmarks, VQA-X and e-SNLI-VE. The improvements are observed across various metrics, including those specifically designed to measure plausibility and faithfulness. The qualitative examples further support the claims, showcasing the ability of Rapper to generate more plausible and faithful explanations compared to existing methods.  The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the contributions of each component of the framework.

However, several aspects could be improved.  The reliance on a pre-trained QA model for rationale filtering could introduce bias and limit the generalizability of the method.  Further analysis on the sensitivity of the filtering threshold (τ) would strengthen the methodology. The description of the reward function in RLNF could be more detailed, clarifying how the answer score and explanation score are combined and weighted.  More extensive qualitative analysis, perhaps including examples of failures, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.  Finally, a discussion of the computational cost and scalability of the approach would be beneficial.

Overall, this is a well-written and promising paper that makes significant contributions to the field of VQA-NLE. The proposed Rapper framework effectively addresses the challenging issues of implausibility and hallucination, achieving state-of-the-art results.  Addressing the minor limitations mentioned above would further strengthen the paper's impact.
