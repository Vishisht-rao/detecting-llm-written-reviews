OUTPUT:
This paper introduces Customized Polytropon (C-Poly), a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method for multi-task learning (MTL).  C-Poly builds upon existing work like Polytropon and MoLoRA, but distinguishes itself by explicitly separating task-common and task-specific skill modules.  This separation aims to improve sample efficiency and mitigate the negative transfer often observed in MTL.

The paper is well-structured and clearly presents the methodology.  The authors effectively explain C-Poly's architecture and its relationship to previous MoE-like PEFT methods. The mathematical formulation of the approach is presented concisely and aids understanding. The use of low-rank techniques (LoRA) for parameter efficiency is well-justified.

The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, using multiple benchmark datasets (SuperGLUE and Super Natural-Instructions) and base models (T5, FLAN-T5, GLM). The results convincingly demonstrate that C-Poly outperforms various baselines, including LoRA, MoE-LoRA, Poly, and MHR, across different tasks and model architectures.  The ablation studies on the number of tasks, model scale, and skill allocation provide valuable insights into the method's strengths and limitations.  The visualization of the task-common skill allocation matrix and the task clustering analysis offer further interpretability and support the claims of improved knowledge sharing and task distinction.

However, some aspects could be improved. While the paper mentions the Gumbel-sigmoid approach for handling the non-differentiable nature of the binary allocation matrix, a more detailed explanation of the implementation and its hyperparameter tuning would be beneficial.  Similarly, a deeper discussion of the optimal balance between task-common and task-specific parameters would strengthen the analysis.  The paper focuses heavily on the performance improvements but could benefit from a more thorough discussion of the computational cost and overall efficiency gains compared to full fine-tuning, especially considering the increased number of modules.  Finally, comparing against other state-of-the-art MTL methods beyond the specified PEFT baselines would further solidify the paper's contributions.

Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of PEFT for MTL. The proposed C-Poly method shows promising results and the comprehensive experimental evaluation provides strong evidence of its effectiveness.  Addressing the minor suggestions above would further enhance the paper's impact.  The paper is suitable for publication at ICLR 2024.
