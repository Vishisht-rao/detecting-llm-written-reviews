OUTPUT:
This paper introduces Diffusion Generative Flow Samplers (DGFS), a novel approach to sampling from intractable high-dimensional density functions.  The core contribution lies in addressing the credit assignment problem inherent in existing diffusion-based sampling methods like Path Integral Samplers (PIS) and Denoising Diffusion Samplers (DDS).  These methods suffer from learning signals only present at the terminal time step, leading to inefficient training.

DGFS cleverly mitigates this by incorporating an additional "flow function" network, inspired by Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets). This allows the learning process to be broken down into shorter partial trajectory segments, providing intermediate learning signals and reducing gradient variance.  The paper provides a clear theoretical foundation, connecting the proposed method to both stochastic optimal control and GFlowNets.  The detailed balance constraint, adapted from GFlowNets, is particularly well-explained.  The authors also demonstrate the ability to update parameters using incomplete trajectories.

The empirical results are compelling, showing DGFS outperforming PIS and DDS across various challenging benchmarks, including Mixture of Gaussians, Funnel, Manywell, VAE, and Cox processes. The improved performance is convincingly attributed to the reduced gradient variance and the availability of intermediate learning signals. Visualizations of the learned flow function and sample distributions further support the claims.  The ablation studies investigating different design choices, such as the use of intermediate signals, variance-preserving SDEs, and the weighting coefficient lambda, are thorough and insightful.  The inclusion of a discussion about the off-policy exploration potential of DGFS is also a significant contribution, highlighting a valuable feature that differentiates it from previous methods.

However, some minor aspects could be improved. While the connection to GFlowNets is clearly established, a more detailed comparison to other GFlowNet-based methods for continuous spaces would strengthen the paper.  The authors mention the computational cost of DGFS compared to PIS, but a more quantitative analysis would be beneficial. Finally, some discussion of the limitations of the proposed method, beyond the acknowledged limitations in the conclusion, would be valuable. For instance, are there any specific types of target distributions where DGFS might perform poorly?

Overall, this is a well-written and significant contribution to the field of sampling from intractable distributions. The proposed DGFS method is theoretically sound, empirically validated, and offers a promising approach to address the limitations of existing diffusion-based samplers. The paper's clarity, thoroughness, and compelling results make it a strong candidate for acceptance at ICLR 2024.
