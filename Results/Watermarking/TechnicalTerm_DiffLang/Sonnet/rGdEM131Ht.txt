OUTPUT:
This paper introduces TF-EBM, a novel energy-based model for univariate time series forecasting and imputation.  The authors address a significant limitation of existing models: the inability to provide coherent long-term probabilistic forecasts.  TF-EBM tackles this by modeling the joint distribution of entire temporal paths using an energy function, leveraging a time-frequency fusion approach.  The use of Langevin MCMC for sampling is a practical choice for efficiency.

The paper is well-written and presents a clear motivation and methodology.  The architecture, incorporating dilated convolutional networks and time-frequency feature extraction, is innovative and addresses the challenge of capturing both local and global patterns in time series data. The use of a residual time-frequency block is a sensible approach to training deeper models.  The choice of maximum likelihood estimation with gradient-based MCMC is appropriate for training energy-based models.  The authors' claim of parameter efficiency compared to transformers is supported by the computational complexity analysis.

The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, covering probabilistic forecasting, long-term forecasting, and imputation tasks across multiple public datasets.  The comparison with relevant baselines is thorough.  The ablation studies convincingly demonstrate the contributions of the residual dilated convolutional network and the time-frequency feature extraction.  The inclusion of transfer learning experiments further strengthens the paper's contribution.  However, the presentation of experimental results could be improved by clearer visualization.

Some concerns remain.  While the authors claim that their model is "parameter-efficient," the exact extent of this efficiency needs more rigorous quantification and comparison.  The discussion of the synthetic data experiments could be expanded to better demonstrate the model's generalization capability to real-world datasets.  The paper primarily focuses on univariate time series; extension to multivariate time series would significantly broaden its applicability and impact.  Finally, the claim of a "unified" solution for multiple tasks requires stronger justification, possibly by quantitatively comparing the performance across tasks with a single pre-trained model versus models trained separately for each task.

Overall, this paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of time series forecasting.  The proposed TF-EBM model is novel and addresses a significant problem.  The experimental evaluation is strong, and the ablation studies are well-conducted.  Addressing the minor concerns mentioned above would further strengthen the paper. I recommend acceptance, pending minor revisions.
