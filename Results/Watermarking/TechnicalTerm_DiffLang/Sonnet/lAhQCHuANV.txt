OUTPUT:
This paper addresses a critical yet under-explored issue in face recognition: the quantification of uncertainty in ROC curve estimation and fairness metrics. The authors convincingly argue that the common practice of relying solely on empirical ROC curves for model comparison and fairness assessment is insufficient, especially given the high societal impact of face recognition technology.

The core contribution lies in adapting the bootstrap methodology to the specific challenges posed by similarity scoring functions.  The authors correctly identify that false acceptance/rejection rates in this context are U-statistics, a crucial distinction from previous work on ROC curve bootstrapping.  They demonstrate that a naive application of existing bootstrap techniques leads to significant underestimation and propose a novel recentering technique to address this.  This is a significant methodological advancement.

The theoretical analysis provides asymptotic guarantees for the proposed recentered bootstrap, proving its consistency in estimating the ROC curve and fairness metrics.  The inclusion of a formal proof of consistency is a strength, adding rigor to the proposed method.  Furthermore, the development of a scalar uncertainty measure for ROC curves and fairness metrics allows for more nuanced model comparisons.

The empirical evaluation strengthens the paper's claims. The experiments on real face image datasets, including comparisons across different models and datasets, clearly illustrate the practical impact of the proposed methodology. The visualization of confidence bands and uncertainty measures effectively demonstrates the improved reliability offered by the recentered bootstrap.  The discussion of different fairness metrics and their uncertainties provides valuable insights for practitioners.

The paper is well-structured, clearly explaining the background, methodology, and results.  The supplementary material containing pseudo-codes and further details on experiments enhances reproducibility.

However, some minor improvements could be considered.  A more detailed discussion on the assumptions underlying the theoretical results would be beneficial.  While the paper mentions some assumptions in the appendix, a more concise summary in the main text might improve clarity.  Additionally, exploring the computational complexity of the recentered bootstrap, especially in comparison to the naive approach, would be valuable.

Overall, this is a strong and important contribution to the field. The proposed recentered bootstrap methodology for uncertainty quantification in similarity scoring is novel, rigorously supported, and demonstrably beneficial in practice.  The paper significantly advances the state-of-the-art in reliable assessment of face recognition systems, both in terms of accuracy and fairness.  It deserves publication at ICLR 2024.
