OUTPUT:
This paper tackles the novel problem of causal inconsistency between structure and representation in indefinite data—a data type characterized by multiple underlying causal structures and multi-valued variables.  The authors' identification of this issue is a valuable contribution, as existing causal discovery methods often overlook this challenge when applied to non-statistical data like images, text, and videos.

The paper proposes a self-supervised learning framework to address causal inconsistency.  The core of the framework is the Causal Consistency Condition (CCC), which provides a theoretical basis for assessing consistency between learned causal structures and representations. The framework uses interventions as "views" and measures of causal strength as "augments," with the CCC serving as the "philosophy" guiding the learning process.  The two provided implementation examples, one for supervised specialized models (SSMs) and one for large language models (LLMs), demonstrate the framework's adaptability.

The introduction of the Causalogue dataset is a significant strength.  This high-quality causal dialogue dataset addresses the lack of suitable data for evaluating causal consistency in indefinite data, and its creation methodology is well-described.  The experimental results on Causalogue and other real-world datasets, including three downstream tasks (ECPE, ERC, and TAS), support the claim that the proposed framework improves causal consistency and consequently improves performance on these tasks.  The ablation study further clarifies the contribution of different components of the framework.

However, several aspects require further clarification and development:

The definitions of causal data and its sub-types (definite, semi-definite, indefinite) could benefit from more intuitive explanations and illustrative examples.  The current definitions, while formally precise, are challenging to grasp without a deeper background in causal inference. The appendix helps but could be integrated more seamlessly into the main text.

The CCC, while innovative, currently applies only to causal models with identical variable sets.  The authors acknowledge this limitation and propose a general CCC as future work, but this limitation significantly restricts the applicability of the current framework.

The LLM implementation, while interesting, relies heavily on the accuracy of the similarity matrix calculated for the representations (Simr).  The results suggest this is a potential bottleneck, and more robust methods for obtaining Simr should be explored.

The experimental evaluation, while extensive, could be strengthened by a more detailed analysis of the results across different datasets and tasks.  A deeper discussion of the types of inconsistencies the framework is effectively addressing would enhance the paper’s impact.

Overall, the paper presents a compelling approach to a significant problem in the emerging field of causal representation learning.  The novel contributions, including the CCC and the Causalogue dataset, are valuable.  However, addressing the limitations and improving the clarity of the theoretical and empirical contributions would significantly enhance the paper's impact.  The proposed future work on generalizing the CCC is crucial for broader applicability.
