OUTPUT:
This paper presents a fascinating comparative study of curriculum learning in children and reinforcement learning (RL) agents. The core idea – that children implicitly use their level of competence as an intrinsic reward signal to guide their learning – is novel and insightful. The experimental design, using Procgen environments adapted for both child and agent participants, allows for a direct comparison, a significant strength of the work.

The findings regarding children are compelling. The observation that children strategically select easier levels when their competence is low, and harder levels when it's high, strongly supports the hypothesis that competence serves as an intrinsic reward.  The analysis of level and global advancements, while showing a significant overall improvement towards the target goal, also highlights the limitations of using only global advancement as a metric for curriculum learning in the context of extrinsic goals.  The analysis of the (intentionally included) irrelevant Level 4 further strengthens the argument for children's understanding of causal relationships in their curriculum selection.

The RL experiments provide a crucial test of the findings in children.  The stark contrast between the baseline curriculum learning (which frequently suffers from catastrophic forgetting) and the improved performance when level competence is included as an auxiliary reward is impactful. The detailed analysis of a trial demonstrating recovery from catastrophic forgetting using this auxiliary reward is particularly convincing.  The inclusion of additional baselines, such as random level selection and stochastic curricula, further strengthens the robustness of the results, though a more detailed analysis of the differences in performance would be beneficial.

However, some aspects could be improved. The definition and calculation of level competence, while described, could benefit from more precise mathematical formulation and a clearer explanation of how it would be extracted from high-dimensional image inputs in a real-world application.  The paper could also benefit from a more thorough discussion of existing RL curriculum learning methods and a more explicit comparison with state-of-the-art techniques. The reliance on a hand-designed curriculum in the RL experiments, while justified by the focus on mirroring the children's experiment, limits the scope of the generalizability of the findings.

Despite these minor criticisms, this paper makes a substantial contribution. The integration of cognitive science and RL is well-executed, leading to a strong argument for the importance of competence-based intrinsic rewards in effective curriculum learning.  The findings have implications for both understanding human learning and improving the robustness of RL agents. The paper is well-written and presents its findings clearly.  Overall, I recommend acceptance.
