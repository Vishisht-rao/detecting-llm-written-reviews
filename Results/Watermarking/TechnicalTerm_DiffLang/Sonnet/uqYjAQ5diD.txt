OUTPUT:
This paper presents FMapping, a novel framework for real-time dense RGB mapping using a factorized neural radiance field. The core idea is leveraging depth covariance functions to provide geometric guidance even without depth sensors, which is a significant contribution addressing a key limitation in RGB-only mapping.  The two-stage approach, incorporating an initialization phase and an on-the-fly phase, is well-motivated and addresses the challenges of unstable trackers and limited optimization time.

The use of a factorized neural field for efficiency is a sound choice, and the comparison between Tri-plane and Factorization methods is helpful in justifying this decision. The self-supervised depth training using SDF consistency is an innovative approach to improve depth estimation accuracy.  The covariance-guided sampling strategy seems promising for efficient and accurate sample placement, focusing on high-uncertainty regions.  The mathematical formulation of the problem and the loss functions is clear and well-defined.  The experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to other RGB-only methods and even show comparable results to some RGB-D methods, which is quite impressive. The quantitative analysis with depth L1 error and PSNR is appropriate.

However, several points need clarification or further investigation:

The paper mentions a pre-trained depth covariance function.  More details about this function, including the dataset used for pre-training and the specific kernel used, are needed.  The robustness of the method to different scene types and lighting conditions should be further investigated.  The impact of the hyperparameters (β values, learning rates, sampling sizes) on the final performance needs to be analyzed.  Additional qualitative results, perhaps showing failure cases, would strengthen the paper.

The relationship between the covariance function and the uncertainty estimation from the NeRF needs more detailed explanation. How is the uncertainty map obtained, and how is its reliability ensured? The paper assumes relatively accurate depth estimation in the on-the-fly stage, but a discussion on the sensitivity of the covariance-guided sampling to errors in the initial depth estimates would be beneficial. The choice of 20 frames in the active window is not explicitly justified.  An ablation study on the window size would improve the analysis.


Despite these points, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of real-time dense mapping. The proposed method is novel, well-motivated, and demonstrates strong empirical results. Addressing the aforementioned points would significantly strengthen the paper and increase its impact.  Overall, I recommend acceptance, pending the authors address the suggested improvements.
