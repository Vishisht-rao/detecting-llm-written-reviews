OUTPUT:
This paper tackles the problem of catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, focusing on the architectural aspect rather than algorithmic solutions.  The authors' core contribution is the introduction of "elephant activation functions," designed to promote both sparse representations and sparse gradients, thereby mitigating forgetting.  The theoretical analysis, while making simplifying assumptions, provides a plausible explanation for the effectiveness of the proposed activation function by linking gradient sparsity to the desirable properties of error correction and local elasticity.  The experimental results across regression, class incremental learning, and reinforcement learning demonstrate the practical benefits of elephant neural networks (ENNs).

Strengths:

* Novel contribution: The proposed elephant activation function is a novel architectural component specifically designed for continual learning. This is a refreshing approach compared to existing algorithmic solutions.
* Theoretical justification: The theoretical analysis, though simplified, provides a reasonable framework for understanding why sparse representations and sparse gradients are beneficial for continual learning, and how elephant activation functions achieve this.
* Comprehensive experiments: The authors evaluate their method across diverse continual learning tasks, including regression, class incremental learning, and reinforcement learning, showcasing its broad applicability.  The experiments include comparisons to relevant baselines, although the lack of comparison to the most recent state-of-the-art methods in class incremental learning is a minor weakness.  The inclusion of results with and without pre-training strengthens the analysis.
* Strong empirical results: The results demonstrate a significant improvement in performance over baseline methods, especially in scenarios with limited memory (e.g., small replay buffers in RL).  The single-pass, task-boundary-free approach in class incremental learning is particularly noteworthy.


Weaknesses:

* Theoretical limitations: The theoretical analysis relies on significant simplifications (e.g., single-layer MLP, asymptotic analysis for d→∞).  A more rigorous theoretical analysis considering deeper networks and realistic values of d would strengthen the paper.
* Limited discussion of hyperparameter sensitivity: The paper mentions sweeping hyperparameters, but a more detailed analysis of hyperparameter sensitivity and the robustness of the proposed method to variations in hyperparameters would be beneficial.  The choice of hyperparameters appears somewhat arbitrary, and additional explanation or justification is needed.
* Comparison to state-of-the-art: While the paper compares to several relevant baselines, a more direct comparison to the very latest and most advanced methods in each of the tested tasks would strengthen the claims of improvement.
* Clarity of some sections: Certain parts of the theoretical analysis and the description of experimental setups could be clarified for improved readability. For instance, a more detailed explanation of how the local elasticity is measured and visualized in the regression task would enhance understanding.


Overall:

Despite the limitations mentioned above, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of continual learning. The proposed elephant activation function, supported by theoretical analysis and strong empirical results, offers a promising new approach to mitigating catastrophic forgetting.  Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further enhance the impact and clarity of the paper.  The paper is recommended for acceptance, pending minor revisions.
