OUTPUT:
This paper introduces ArchLock, a novel approach to mitigating unauthorized deep neural network (DNN) transferability by focusing on architectural-level defenses.  The core idea is to use neural architecture search (NAS) to find architectures that perform well on the source task but poorly on potential target tasks. This is a valuable contribution as most existing defenses operate at the model parameter level.

The paper's strength lies in its clear problem formulation and the innovative use of zero-cost proxies (ZCPs) and a binary predictor within an evolutionary search framework. The use of multiple ZCPs to improve prediction accuracy and the incorporation of task embeddings to simulate unseen target tasks are particularly clever.  The meta-learning approach for the predictor is well-motivated and addresses a key challenge in cross-task NAS. The experimental evaluation on NAS-Bench-201 and TransNAS-Bench-101 demonstrates the effectiveness of ArchLock, showing significant reductions in transferability with minimal performance degradation on the source task. The code availability further enhances the paper's contribution.

However, several aspects require further clarification and discussion:

The paper assumes a certain degree of similarity between source and target tasks. While this is a reasonable assumption for transfer learning, the robustness of ArchLock to significantly dissimilar target tasks needs further investigation.  The impact of different similarity thresholds (d in equation 4) on the effectiveness of the method should be explored more thoroughly.  The choice of cosine similarity for measuring task embedding similarity should also be justified.

The effectiveness of the binary predictor relies heavily on the chosen ZCPs.  The paper justifies its selection of 7 ZCPs, but a more comprehensive ablation study comparing different combinations and the impact of individual ZCPs would strengthen the results.  The ensemble method used to generate the binary label also warrants further detail.

While the evolutionary search is computationally efficient, the scalability of ArchLock to larger search spaces should be considered.  A comparison with other NAS algorithms that might be more scalable, like those based on differentiable architecture search, could be beneficial.

The discussion of related work is adequate but could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing cross-task NAS methods.  The paper highlights the difference in objective (minimizing target task performance vs maximizing it), but a more nuanced comparison of the techniques employed would provide valuable context.

Finally, the paper focuses on classification tasks.  The generalizability of ArchLock to other types of tasks (e.g., regression, object detection) should be discussed.

In summary, this is a promising paper that tackles an important problem.  Addressing the points mentioned above would significantly enhance its impact and contribution to the field.  The paper is well-written and the results are compelling, suggesting ArchLock is a valuable new tool for securing DNN models against unauthorized transfer.
