OUTPUT:
This paper proposes FreqTST, a novel time series forecasting model that leverages frequency domain representation for tokenization and integrates it with a transformer architecture.  The core idea of using frequency components as tokens is interesting and addresses a key limitation of directly applying transformers to time series data, namely the lack of inherent semantic units analogous to words in text.

The paper is well-structured and presents a clear methodology.  The frequency vectorization module, including the use of FFT and the construction of frequency token dictionaries, is described thoroughly. The introduction of two pretraining tasks, Time Series Reconstruction and Maximum Position Prediction, is a valuable contribution, addressing the potential misalignment between frequency and time domains. The mathematical formulations are provided, aiding reproducibility.

The experimental section is comprehensive, employing multiple datasets and a range of forecasting lengths.  The inclusion of relevant baselines allows for a strong comparative analysis. The results demonstrate that FreqTST outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly in long-term forecasting.  The zero-shot transfer learning experiments further highlight the model's generalization capabilities.  The ablation study on the pretraining tasks provides valuable insights into their individual and combined contributions.  The comparison to data augmentation enhanced baselines helps isolate the impact of the proposed frequency vectorization.

However, some aspects could be strengthened:

While the authors argue that the frequency units are independent, the Transformer architecture inherently introduces dependencies through the attention mechanism.  A deeper discussion on how the model handles these potentially conflicting aspects would be beneficial.

The choice of hyperparameters, particularly the loss weight β, seems somewhat arbitrary. A more rigorous hyperparameter search or sensitivity analysis would enhance the robustness of the results.

The computational cost of FreqTST, especially for long-term forecasting, could be discussed more explicitly. While the authors mention computational efficiency gains from considering only the first L’ frequencies, a direct comparison of computational time with the baselines would be valuable.

Finally, the paper's claim of being the first to use the frequency domain for time series tokenization should be substantiated with a more extensive literature review, potentially exploring related work from signal processing or other domains.

Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to time series forecasting. The proposed method shows strong empirical performance and addresses a crucial challenge in applying transformers to this type of data.  Addressing the minor suggestions above would further enhance the paper's impact and clarity.  I recommend acceptance to the conference.
