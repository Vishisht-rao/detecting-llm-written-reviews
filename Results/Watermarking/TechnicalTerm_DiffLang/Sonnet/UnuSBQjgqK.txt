OUTPUT:
This paper proposes Constrained Intrinsic Motivation (CIM), a novel approach to intrinsic motivation in reinforcement learning (RL), addressing limitations in existing methods.  The authors tackle two key problems: designing an effective intrinsic objective for reward-free pre-training (RFPT) and mitigating bias introduced by intrinsic rewards in exploration with intrinsic motivation (EIM) tasks.

The paper's strength lies in its comprehensive analysis of existing intrinsic motivation techniques, categorizing them and highlighting their respective weaknesses.  The proposed CIM method for RFPT is particularly interesting, combining elements of data-based and competence-based approaches. The use of a lower bound on conditional state entropy and a novel alignment constraint to encourage dynamic skill discovery is a significant contribution. The empirical results demonstrating improved performance and sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly the drastic reduction in sample complexity for the Ant environment, are compelling. The visualization of learned skills also effectively showcases the diversity and interpretability achieved by CIM.

The CIM method for EIM, based on constrained policy optimization and an adaptive temperature schedule, offers a potentially valuable solution to the bias problem. The theoretical grounding and empirical validation of this method are less extensive than those for the RFPT component, however.  A more thorough investigation of the hyperparameter sensitivity of the adaptive temperature schedule would strengthen this aspect.

Some aspects require further clarification:

* The mathematical derivation and justification of the proposed intrinsic reward in the RFPT section could benefit from additional detail.  The connection between the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and the proposed reward function is not completely clear.
* A more thorough ablation study investigating the impact of different components of the CIM framework (e.g., the choice of the alignment loss, the nearest neighbor estimator) would enhance the paper's robustness.
* The choice of baseline methods is comprehensive, but the presentation of results could be improved by using consistent metrics across all comparisons.  For instance, state coverage is reported differently for locomotion and manipulation environments.

Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of intrinsic motivation. The CIM method, especially for RFPT, demonstrates strong empirical results and offers a compelling combination of existing approaches.  The EIM component shows promise but warrants further investigation. Addressing the suggested minor clarifications and strengthening the analysis would significantly improve the paper's impact.  The paper is well-written and clearly presented, and I recommend its acceptance to the conference.
