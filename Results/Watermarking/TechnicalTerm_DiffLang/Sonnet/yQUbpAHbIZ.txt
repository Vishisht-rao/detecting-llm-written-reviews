OUTPUT:
This paper presents MC-PNL, a novel method for learning post-nonlinear (PNL) causal relationships from finite samples.  The authors address a significant limitation of existing PNL-based algorithms: their tendency towards computationally expensive, non-convex optimization problems that often fail to produce meaningful results with limited data.  MC-PNL incorporates maximal correlation into the PNL model learning, leading to a more benign optimization landscape amenable to efficient block coordinate descent.  The use of random Fourier features further enhances computational efficiency.

The paper's strengths include a thorough literature review that effectively positions MC-PNL within the existing causal discovery landscape. The authors clearly identify the weaknesses of current independence-based and maximal correlation-based approaches, motivating their proposed method. The theoretical analysis, including Lemma 1, Lemma 2, and Proposition 1, provides a solid foundation for the algorithm's design. The empirical evaluation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates MC-PNL's superiority in terms of both speed and accuracy compared to several state-of-the-art baselines. The availability of code is a valuable contribution.

However, some aspects could be improved.  The discussion of hyperparameter selection, particularly the choice of λ, is somewhat limited. While the supplementary material may provide more details, the main paper should offer a clearer explanation of how this parameter is chosen in practice and its sensitivity to the data characteristics.  The authors mention fine-tuning strategies using banded residual loss and HSIC with universal kernels, but a more comprehensive analysis of these techniques' impact on performance would strengthen the paper. The explanation of the convergence properties of the BCD algorithm could also benefit from more rigor.  While the authors state that convergence to a critical point is guaranteed under certain conditions, a deeper analysis of the algorithm's convergence rate and the potential for getting stuck in local minima would be valuable.

Overall, this is a well-written paper that presents a significant contribution to the field of causal discovery. MC-PNL addresses a critical challenge in PNL model learning, offering a faster and more accurate alternative to existing methods.  The strong theoretical foundation and compelling empirical results make this a promising approach.  Addressing the points raised above concerning hyperparameter tuning and a more detailed analysis of the convergence properties would further enhance the paper's impact.
