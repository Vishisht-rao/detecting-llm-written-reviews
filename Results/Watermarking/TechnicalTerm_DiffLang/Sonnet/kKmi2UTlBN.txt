OUTPUT:
This paper proposes a novel logits-based knowledge distillation (KD) method using cosine similarity for individual class information transfer.  The core idea is to leverage the scale-invariance property of cosine similarity to improve knowledge transfer compared to traditional KL-divergence based methods.  Furthermore, a cosine similarity weighted temperature (CSWT) scaling is introduced to dynamically adjust the temperature parameter based on the similarity between teacher and student predictions.

The paper is well-written and generally easy to follow. The introduction provides adequate background on KD and motivates the proposed approach effectively. The methodology section clearly explains CSKD and CSWT, and the use of figures helps visualize the concepts. The theoretical analysis using entropy is a valuable contribution, providing some justification for the choice of cosine similarity.  The experimental results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing improvements over several existing KD techniques, and in some cases, even surpassing the teacher model's performance.  The ablation study further supports the contribution of each component. The inclusion of an orthogonality analysis with respect to ReviewKD is also a positive aspect.

However, there are some areas for improvement:

* The theoretical analysis, while interesting, relies on an assumption (Assumption 3.3) that needs stronger justification.  Additional theoretical backing or empirical evidence to support this assumption would strengthen the paper. The lemmas and proposition should be expanded on further and the proofs should be fully included within the main paper rather than relegated to the appendix.

* While the paper mentions that implementation details and additional experiments are provided in the supplementary materials,  crucial details like the specific hyperparameter settings (besides Tmin and Tmax) and the training procedures should be included in the main paper for completeness and reproducibility.

* The comparison with other state-of-the-art KD methods could be made more rigorous.  A more detailed discussion of the specific methods used for comparison, including their architectural choices and training settings, would increase the confidence in the comparative results.

* The claims of surpassing teacher performance need careful scrutiny.  Are these results statistically significant? Error bars or standard deviations should be included in the tables to better assess the reliability of the performance improvements.  Further discussion on why the student outperforms the teacher in some instances would be beneficial.


Overall, the paper presents a novel and interesting approach to knowledge distillation. The proposed method is well-motivated, and the experimental results are promising.  However, addressing the points raised above, particularly strengthening the theoretical analysis and providing more details on the experimental setup, would significantly enhance the paper's impact and contribute to a stronger conclusion.  The paper is suitable for ICLR 2024, provided these improvements are incorporated.
