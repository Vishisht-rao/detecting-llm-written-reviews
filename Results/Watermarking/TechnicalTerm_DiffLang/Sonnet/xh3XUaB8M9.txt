OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the problem of hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) by proposing a novel method called visual evidence prompting.  The core idea is to leverage the strengths of smaller, specialized visual models (object detection and scene graph generation) to provide factual evidence that guides the LLM's response generation.  This is a conceptually simple yet potentially impactful approach.

The paper is well-structured and clearly written. The introduction effectively motivates the problem and positions the proposed method within the existing literature. The related work section provides a good overview of relevant research on hallucinations in both LLMs and LVLMs.  The methodology is clearly explained, with a straightforward description of the two-step prompting process.  The proposed method is novel in its combination of small visual models and LLMs to mitigate hallucinations.

The experimental evaluation is a strong point. The authors introduce a new benchmark for relation hallucinations, which is a valuable contribution to the field.  The experiments on three different LVLMs demonstrate consistent improvements in both object and relation hallucination tasks across different models, suggesting the general applicability of the approach.  The ablation studies examining the impact of visual model capacity, erroneous evidence, prompt templates, and out-of-domain images are thorough and provide valuable insights into the robustness and limitations of the method.

However, some aspects could be strengthened.  While the authors acknowledge the potential for more sophisticated visual evidence formats, exploring these alternatives would strengthen the paper.  Furthermore, a more detailed discussion of the computational cost of integrating the small visual models into the LLM pipeline would be beneficial. The analysis of erroneous visual evidence, while present, could be expanded by providing a more detailed error analysis. For example, categorizing the types of errors made by the small visual models and their impact on the LLM’s performance would be insightful.  Finally, a comparison with other hallucination mitigation techniques beyond instruction tuning would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.

Overall, this is a strong paper with a novel approach to a significant problem. The experimental results are compelling, and the ablation studies provide a good understanding of the method's strengths and weaknesses.  Addressing the minor suggestions above would further enhance the paper's impact.  I recommend acceptance to the conference.
