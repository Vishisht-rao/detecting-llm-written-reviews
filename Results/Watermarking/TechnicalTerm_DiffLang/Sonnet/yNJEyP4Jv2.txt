Review of "Understanding and Improving Adversarial Attacks on Latent Diffusion Models"

This paper addresses the important and timely problem of protecting images from unauthorized use in latent diffusion models (LDMs) for few-shot generation.  The authors propose an improved targeted adversarial attack (ITA) that aims to enhance both the effectiveness and memory efficiency of existing methods.

Strengths:

The paper clearly identifies a significant problem: the vulnerability of LDMs to unauthorized image generation and the limitations of current adversarial defenses.  The proposed ITA addresses these limitations directly.  The inclusion of memory efficiency improvements is a valuable contribution, as it makes the attack more accessible to users with limited computational resources. The experimental evaluation is relatively thorough, comparing the proposed method to several baselines across different LDM architectures and few-shot generation pipelines (SDEdit and LoRA). The ablation studies provide insights into the design choices, particularly regarding the target image selection. The investigation of robustness against denoising-based defenses is also a relevant contribution.  The paper is well-structured and generally easy to follow.


Weaknesses:

While the paper demonstrates improvements in effectiveness and memory efficiency, the magnitude of these improvements could be better quantified.  For instance, the improvements in MS-SSIM, CLIP-SIM, and CLIP-IQA scores are presented numerically, but a more detailed analysis of statistical significance would strengthen the claims.  The choice of target images for the targeted attack requires further justification.  While the authors discuss the selection process, a more rigorous analysis of different target image characteristics and their impact on attack performance is needed.  The discussion on the cross-model transferability is somewhat limited and could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the reasons behind the observed variations across different LDM versions. The black-box evaluation, while included, is still relatively limited in scope.  A more extensive exploration of different black-box scenarios would strengthen the practical applicability claims.  Finally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential limitations and ethical implications of the proposed attack.


Overall:

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of adversarial attacks on LDMs.  The proposed ITA shows promise in improving both the effectiveness and accessibility of such attacks. However, the paper could benefit from strengthening the quantitative analysis, providing more detailed justifications for design choices, and expanding the scope of the black-box evaluation and ethical considerations.  With these improvements, the paper would be suitable for publication at ICLR 2024.  I recommend acceptance pending minor revisions.
