OUTPUT:
This paper proposes a novel method for generating robust and transferable unlearnable examples to protect data from unauthorized use.  The core idea is to induce data collapse through manipulation of the data distribution, thereby reducing the information available for model training.  This is combined with a modified adversarial training process to ensure robustness against adversarial attacks.

The paper is well-written and clearly presents the methodology.  The motivation for the work is clearly articulated, highlighting the limitations of existing methods in terms of transferability and robustness to adversarial training. The proposed method addresses these shortcomings directly. The notation is clearly defined and the algorithm is presented in a straightforward manner.

The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, using multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet subset) and different model architectures.  The results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of both robustness and transferability. The ablation study provides further evidence supporting the individual contributions of data collapse and the modified adversarial training process.  The visualization using t-SNE plots is helpful in illustrating the effect of data collapse.

However, there are some points that could be improved:

The claim of being the "first" to generate unlearnable examples using data collapse needs to be more rigorously substantiated. A thorough literature review focusing specifically on this aspect should be provided to convincingly support this claim.

The computational cost of the method, particularly the training of the score model, is acknowledged as a limitation.  A more quantitative analysis of this cost, perhaps comparing it to the computational cost of other state-of-the-art methods, would strengthen this section.  Suggestions for future work could include exploring more efficient methods for estimating the data distribution gradient.

While the paper demonstrates strong performance against several existing methods, it would benefit from a discussion on potential attacks that might still be effective against this approach. This would provide a more balanced perspective on the limitations of the method and suggest avenues for future research.

The appendix contains additional experimental results, which is helpful.  However, it would be beneficial to summarize these key findings in the main body of the paper rather than relegating them solely to the appendix.


Overall, this is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of data protection in machine learning. The proposed method addresses a crucial limitation of existing techniques and demonstrates superior performance. Addressing the points mentioned above would further strengthen the paper and enhance its impact.  I recommend acceptance, pending minor revisions.
