OUTPUT:
This paper proposes a general framework for designing intrinsic Riemannian classifiers, focusing on symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds.  The authors address a significant limitation of existing methods, which often rely on specific geometric properties, limiting their applicability.  The proposed framework requires only the existence of the Riemannian logarithm, a relatively weak condition satisfied by many manifolds commonly used in machine learning.

The core contribution is a novel Riemannian multiclass logistic regression (MLR) framework.  The authors systematically generalize five families of Riemannian metrics on SPD manifolds using a power deformation map, deriving corresponding SPD classifiers.  This unified approach is a strength of the paper, providing a clear and consistent methodology.  The authors demonstrate that some previous works are special cases of their framework.

The experimental evaluation across three diverse applications (radar recognition, human action recognition, and EEG classification) shows consistent performance gains over existing methods, particularly in human action recognition.  The results support the claims of broader applicability and effectiveness.  The inclusion of detailed experimental setup and hyperparameter selection is commendable.

However, some aspects require further clarification. The claim of "minimal geometric properties" needs more careful justification. While the reliance on only the Riemannian logarithm is an improvement, the practicality of this assumption across all manifolds needs to be better explored. The paper mentions computational challenges in calculating margin distances in existing methods, but a deeper comparison of computational complexity between the proposed framework and existing methods would strengthen the argument.  The over-parameterization issue in the proposed RMLR is acknowledged as a limitation, and addressing this is a crucial direction for future work.

The paper is well-written and generally easy to follow, although some familiarity with Riemannian geometry is assumed.  The mathematical derivations are presented concisely, and the appendix provides necessary details.  The figures illustrating the deformation of metrics and SPD hyperplanes are helpful in visualizing the concepts.

Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of geometric deep learning. The proposed framework offers a promising approach for designing intrinsic Riemannian classifiers with broader applicability.  Addressing the mentioned limitations and providing a more detailed complexity analysis would further enhance the paper's impact.  The paper is recommended for acceptance, pending minor revisions to address these points.
