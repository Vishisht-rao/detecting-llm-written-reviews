OUTPUT:
This paper introduces Multi-Objective Direct Preference Optimization (MODPO), a novel RL-free algorithm for aligning language models (LMs) with multiple, potentially conflicting, human preferences.  The core idea is to integrate linear scalarization into reward modeling, training LMs to implicitly represent different collective reward models.  This contrasts with multi-objective RLHF (MORLHF), which involves separate reward model training and RL fine-tuning for each preference weighting.

The paper's strengths lie in its clear motivation—addressing the instability and computational cost of MORLHF—and its elegant theoretical foundation. The authors convincingly argue that MODPO produces the same optimal solutions as MORLHF while being more stable and efficient.  The empirical results on safety alignment and long-form question answering support these claims, showing MODPO matching or exceeding the performance of MORLHF with significantly reduced computational resources (a claimed 3x reduction).  The inclusion of both synthetic and real feedback experiments strengthens the evaluation.  The ablation studies further enhance the paper's rigor by exploring design choices within MODPO.

However, there are some areas for improvement.  The paper's theoretical guarantees rely on assumptions, particularly the availability of at least one preference dataset. While the authors address this limitation, providing a workaround involving randomly labeled data, a more thorough discussion of the impact of this assumption on practical performance would be beneficial.  The evaluation metrics, while well-justified, could be expanded to include more nuanced measures of LM quality beyond reward and KL divergence. For instance, human evaluation of generated text quality independent of the specific objectives could provide a valuable context.  Finally, while the paper mentions scaling to more than two objectives, a more extensive exploration of this aspect, potentially with larger-scale experiments, would further demonstrate the scalability and robustness of MODPO.

Overall, this is a strong submission with a well-defined problem, a compelling solution, and supportive empirical results. The theoretical analysis provides a solid foundation, although a more in-depth discussion of the assumptions and their impact is warranted. The paper's contribution is significant, offering a more efficient and stable alternative to MORLHF for multi-objective LM alignment.  Minor revisions addressing the points mentioned above would further strengthen the paper.
