OUTPUT:
This paper presents a novel framework for semi-supervised classification that incorporates out-of-domain unlabeled data. The authors combine distributionally robust optimization (DRO) with self-supervised training, resulting in a computationally efficient algorithm.  The theoretical analysis focuses on a binary classification problem with a mixture of two Gaussians in high dimensions, deriving non-asymptotic generalization bounds for both robust and non-robust losses.  These bounds show improvements over traditional ERM, particularly when the number of unlabeled samples is sufficiently large compared to the number of labeled samples.  The paper also extends the analysis to non-isotropic Gaussian models.  Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets (histopathology images) support the theoretical findings, demonstrating improved accuracy even when the unlabeled data originates from a different distribution.

Strengths:

* Novel framework: The combination of DRO and self-supervised learning with out-of-domain unlabeled data is a novel contribution.
* Theoretical analysis: The paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis with non-asymptotic generalization bounds, addressing a gap in existing literature.  The extension to non-isotropic Gaussians is a valuable generalization.
* Empirical validation:  Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data support the theoretical claims. The use of histopathology images provides a relevant application.
* Clarity: The paper is generally well-written and clearly explains the methodology and results.

Weaknesses:

* Assumptions: The theoretical analysis relies on the assumption of a Gaussian mixture model, which may not hold in many real-world scenarios. The impact of violating this assumption should be discussed more extensively.
* Dependence on hyperparameters: The performance of the method likely depends on the careful tuning of hyperparameters (γ, γ′, λ). The sensitivity to these hyperparameters needs further investigation.  A more systematic hyperparameter search methodology would strengthen the results.
* Limited experimental scope: While the experiments on histopathology data are promising, more extensive experiments on diverse datasets are needed to fully validate the generality of the approach.  The choice of ResNet50 as the feature extractor is not critically discussed.  Why this specific architecture?  Are other choices considered?
* Clarity of section 1.3:  While the notation is introduced, it could be improved by providing more intuition and explaining the choices of the Wasserstein distance and the Wasserstein ball as measures of distributional distance.

Overall:

The paper presents a promising approach to leverage out-of-domain unlabeled data for improving generalization in classification.  The theoretical analysis is strong, and the experimental results are encouraging. However, the limitations regarding the assumptions, hyperparameter sensitivity, and experimental scope should be addressed to further strengthen the paper.  A more detailed discussion of related work, including a clearer comparison with other semi-supervised and DRO methods, would also be beneficial.  Addressing these weaknesses would significantly improve the paper's impact.
