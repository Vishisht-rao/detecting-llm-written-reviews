OUTPUT:
This paper tackles the problem of simplicity bias in deep learning, arguing that a reliance on simple, easily learned features can hinder out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization and robustness.  The authors propose a novel framework, CMID (Conditional Mutual Information Debiasing), which regularizes the conditional mutual information between a complex model and a simple model trained on the same task.  This encourages the complex model to leverage a more diverse set of features, mitigating the simplicity bias.

The paper's strengths lie in its clear motivation, well-defined methodology, and comprehensive empirical evaluation. The authors convincingly demonstrate that spurious features are often simpler than invariant features across a range of datasets. The CMID framework is clearly explained, and its implementation details are sufficiently provided. The empirical results across diverse datasets (image, text, tabular) and tasks (OOD generalization, subgroup robustness, fairness) are impressive, showing consistent improvements over ERM and competitive performance against other methods, especially in scenarios where group labels are unavailable.  The theoretical analysis, though limited to a Gaussian mixture model, provides valuable insight into how the CMID regularization affects feature reliance.  The inclusion of an OOD generalization guarantee within a causal framework is a significant contribution.

However, some weaknesses need addressing. The definition of "simple" models is inherently task-dependent and somewhat subjective, potentially affecting reproducibility. While the authors offer a reasonable heuristic for simple model selection, a more rigorous approach would strengthen the paper.  The theoretical analysis, while insightful, is limited in scope and doesn't fully capture the complexity of real-world deep learning models.  The reliance on an estimated, smoothed CMI raises questions about the tightness of the approximation and its potential impact on the results.  The paper also acknowledges limitations—CMID's ineffectiveness on CelebA is explained, but a deeper exploration of when the approach is and isn't successful would enhance the contribution. Finally, a more detailed comparison with related work, particularly in Appendix D, would be beneficial.  Some claims of superior performance across all cases could benefit from more nuanced discussion of specific cases where the improvement is marginal.


Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field. The proposed CMID framework offers a promising approach to mitigate simplicity bias and improve the robustness and OOD generalization of deep learning models.  The empirical evidence is strong, and the theoretical analysis provides a useful starting point for further investigation.  Addressing the identified weaknesses would further enhance the paper's impact and clarify its limitations.  The paper is suitable for ICLR 2024, but revisions addressing the points above are recommended.
