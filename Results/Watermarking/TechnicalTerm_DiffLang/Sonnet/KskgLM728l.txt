OUTPUT:
This paper presents Bio-RFX, a novel approach to biomedical entity and relation extraction. The authors address the challenges of ambiguous entities, nested proper nouns, and overlapping relation triplets in biomedical text by employing a relation-first extraction strategy.  This contrasts with traditional pipeline or joint methods.  The core idea is to predict relations at the sentence level first, then extract entities based on relation-specific questions, leveraging structural constraints between entity and relation types.  A number prediction module and a pruning algorithm further refine the extraction process.

The paper is well-structured and clearly explains the proposed methodology. The authors provide a comprehensive overview of related work, differentiating Bio-RFX from existing pipeline and joint methods.  The framework is clearly illustrated, and the description of each component is detailed and understandable.  The use of a question-answering approach for entity extraction is innovative and leverages the capabilities of pre-trained language models effectively.  The incorporation of structural constraints is a valuable contribution, addressing a key limitation of many existing methods.

The experimental evaluation is thorough, using multiple biomedical datasets and comparing against a range of strong baselines. The results demonstrate significant improvements in both NER and RE tasks, particularly under low-resource scenarios. The ablation study further supports the effectiveness of the proposed components, highlighting the contributions of structural constraints and the number prediction module.  The inclusion of significance tests adds credibility to the findings.

However, several points could be improved.  The reliance on predefined question templates for entity extraction might limit the model's adaptability to unseen relation types.  Exploring more sophisticated question generation methods could enhance generalization ability. The authors mention error propagation in pipeline training as a future work direction; a more detailed discussion of this issue in the current paper would strengthen the analysis.  While the case study provides qualitative insights,  a more extensive qualitative analysis of model outputs, including error analysis, would be beneficial.  Finally, the comparison with LLMs is brief and could be significantly expanded, potentially including more detailed analyses and discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches.

Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of biomedical information extraction. Bio-RFX offers a promising approach for improving the accuracy and efficiency of entity and relation extraction in the biomedical domain, particularly when dealing with limited training data. The innovative use of relation-first extraction and structural constraints is noteworthy, and the experimental results are compelling. While minor improvements are suggested, the paper is well-written, thoroughly evaluated and worthy of acceptance at ICLR 2024.
