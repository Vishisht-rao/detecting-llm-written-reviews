**Review of "ZeroFlow: Scalable Scene Flow via Distillation"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel framework for scene flow estimation called ZeroFlow, which leverages a distillation approach to produce pseudo-labels using a label-free optimization method. This allows for the training of a fast feedforward model without the need for human annotations, addressing the limitations of current state-of-the-art methods which are often slow and require expensive human supervision. The authors claim that ZeroFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance while being over 1000Ã— faster than traditional optimization-based methods and significantly cheaper to train.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach:** The concept of utilizing a distillation framework to generate pseudo-labels for training a feedforward model is both novel and impactful. This method effectively combines the strengths of existing optimization-based approaches and the speed of feedforward networks.

2. **Performance Gains:** The paper convincingly demonstrates that ZeroFlow outperforms existing methods in terms of speed (34 FPS vs. 0.028 FPS for optimization-based methods) and cost of training (approximately $394 compared to ~ $750,000 for human annotations), which could significantly benefit real-time applications such as autonomous driving.

3. **Robust Experimental Validation:** The authors provide extensive experiments across multiple datasets (Argoverse 2 and Waymo Open) and performance metrics (Threeway EPE). The results indicate the effectiveness of ZeroFlow in scalability and performance compared to both supervised and unsupervised methods.

4. **Open-Source Contribution:** The authors commit to releasing code, trained weights, and high-quality pseudo-labels to the community, facilitating further research in scene flow estimation.

5. **Clear Presentation:** The paper is well-organized and clearly presents the methodology, experimental setup, and results. Figures and tables effectively support the claims made throughout the text.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Evaluation Metrics:** Although the Threeway EPE metric proposed by Chodosh et al. helps in evaluating performance on dynamic and static points, the paper could benefit from additional metrics that capture robustness across various conditions, such as noise in point cloud data or occlusion scenarios.

2. **Limitations Discussion:** While the paper mentions that ZeroFlow inherits the biases of its pseudo-labels, a more in-depth discussion on how this impacts performance in real-world scenarios would strengthen the paper. For instance, it would be useful to address potential failure cases and the ways to mitigate them.

3. **Mechanical Details:** Some readers may find the description of the algorithms and methods, particularly around pseudo-label generation and feedforward model training, somewhat technical. Providing more intuitive explanations or visual aids could enhance accessibility for a broader audience.

4. **Comparative Analysis with Other Works:** While the performance comparison with existing methods is comprehensive, a deeper comparative analysis with alternative self-supervised or weakly supervised methods that are outside the direct lineage of scene flow estimation would provide more context regarding where ZeroFlow stands in the broader landscape of state-of-the-art techniques.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, the paper "ZeroFlow: Scalable Scene Flow via Distillation" makes a valuable addition to the literature on scene flow estimation. The proposed method showcases significant improvements over existing techniques in terms of speed, cost-effectiveness, and scalability, making it a promising candidate for real-time applications. With minor enhancements in the discussions of limitations and broader comparative analyses, the work could have an even greater impact on the research community. Overall, this paper is well-suited for presentation at ICLR 2024 and should be considered for acceptance.
