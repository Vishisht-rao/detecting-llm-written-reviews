OUTPUT:
**Review of "RETHINKING THE BERT-LIKE PRETRAINING FOR DNA SEQUENCES"**

**Overall Assessment:**
This paper addresses an important and timely topic concerning the adaptation of BERT pretraining strategies for DNA sequence analysis. The authors present a novel approach called RandomMask, aimed at improving the performance of DNA sequence models through enhanced pretraining methodologies. The paper is reasonably well-structured, providing insightful observations from exploratory experiments and demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method across multiple datasets. There are, however, some areas that could benefit from clarification and further elaboration.

**Strengths:**
1. **Relevance and Importance:**
   The paper tackles the challenge of adapting language models to biological sequences, a field that is rapidly growing alongside advancements in genomics. Given the potential applications in genomics, bioinformatics, and personalized medicine, this research represents a significant contribution to this domain.

2. **Novelty:**
   The introduction of RandomMask, which dynamically adjusts the complexity of masking during the pretraining phase, is innovative and demonstrates a thoughtful approach to addressing the problem of rapid convergence associated with overlapping tokenization.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:**
   The authors evaluate their method across 28 datasets spanning seven downstream tasks, and the reported improvements over previous state-of-the-art models are substantial. The focus on multiple metrics, including Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), adds robustness to their claims.

4. **Insightful Observations:**
   The exploratory experiments reveal clear trends and provide insights into the effects of different tokenization strategies on model performance, which can guide future research in this area.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Lack of Detailed Methodological Description:**
   The RandomMask methodology is introduced, but further detail on the algorithm's implementation would be beneficial. For instance, an elaboration on the impact of different probabilities and how the masking boundary is adjusted could enhance the understanding of the methodâ€™s strengths and limitations.

2. **Clarification of Findings:**
   The statement that overlapping tokenization leads to undertrained intermediate layers needs more elucidation. Providing data or metrics to back these claims would strengthen the argument and clarify how this insight affects model training and prediction quality.

3. **Comparison to Other Strategies:**
   While the authors do compare their approach with DNABERT, Nucleotide Transformer, and HyenaDNA, an explicit discussion of how RandomMask compares to other existing pretraining strategies would provide context regarding its novelty and effectiveness.

4. **Potential Limitations:**
   The discussion of limitations or potential challenges associated with the proposed approach is minimal. Addressing aspects such as computational costs, applicability to wider genomic tasks, and potential overfitting in certain contexts could provide a more balanced view.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, "RETHINKING THE BERT-LIKE PRETRAINING FOR DNA SEQUENCES" presents a valuable contribution to the field of computational biology and DNA analysis. With some refinements, especially in terms of methodological clarity, discussion on limitations, and comparisons to existing strategies, the paper could bolster its impact on the research community. I recommend acceptance of the paper, contingent upon minor revisions addressing the mentioned weaknesses.
