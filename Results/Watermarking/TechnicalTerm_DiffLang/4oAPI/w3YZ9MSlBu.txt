### Review of "MERT: A COUSTIC MUSIC UNDERSTANDING MODEL WITH LARGE-SCALE SELF-SUPERVISED TRAINING"

#### Summary

The paper presents MERT (Music Understanding Model with large-scale self-supervised Training), designed to address the research gap in applying self-supervised learning (SSL) methods in music audio understanding, a domain that has been less explored than text and speech. The model features innovative elements, such as the use of dual teacher models—acoustic and musical—that facilitate the masked language modeling (MLM) approach. The authors provide thorough evaluations across various music understanding tasks, demonstrating that MERT achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results while being computationally efficient compared to existing models like Jukebox.

#### Strengths

1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The integration of acoustic and musical teacher models in a self-supervised learning framework is a significant contribution to the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR). The paper successfully fills a notable gap in music understanding by leveraging existing SSL techniques more commonly employed in other domains.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The authors evaluate MERT on a diverse range of 14 downstream tasks, providing a substantial amount of results that highlight both the strengths and coverage of the model across different music understanding applications. This extensive empirical demonstration strengthens the claims made in the paper.

3. **Robust Methodological Framework**: The methodological foundation rooted in established models like HuBERT and the careful selection of teachers for acoustic and musical components lends credibility to the approach. The authors provide clear explanations of their innovations, detailing design choices and adjustments made to optimize performance.

4. **Open-source Contribution**: The commitment to releasing an open-source model and codebase is commendable, as it supports the replication and extension of research findings within the community, thus creating potential for further advancements in the domain.

5. **Performance Comparison**: The benchmarking against several baselines, including both supervised and unsupervised methods, is thorough and effectively showcases MERT's performance, reiterating its advantages in terms of parameter efficiency.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Limited Context Length**: A notable limitation discussed is the reliance on short (5-second) audio segments, which could compromise performance in tasks requiring a more holistic understanding of longer musical pieces. While the authors mention future work to address this with longer contexts, it represents a gap that cannot be overlooked for comprehensive music analysis.

2. **Inconsistencies in Task Performance**: While the model achieves competitive scores, some downstream tasks still demonstrate performance close to baselines rather than SOTA results. A more in-depth analysis regarding why certain tasks lag could enhance the reader’s understanding of the model’s capabilities and the implications regarding generalizability.

3. **Gradient Exploding Issues**: The authors note instability during training with larger model sizes, particularly gradient exploding issues. Although solutions are offered, such as gradient clipping and adopting attention relaxation techniques, a clearer outline of the limitations these issues impose would provide better context for real-world applications. 

4. **Ablation Study Clarity**: The ablation studies are comprehensive but could benefit from more structured presentation, possibly through clearer tables or figures that summarize findings succinctly. Some results are presented in text form without visual representation, which can hinder quick comprehension.

5. **Ethical Considerations**: While the authors mention the ethical adherence regarding data usage, a more rigorous discussion on the ethical implications of their model—particularly in relation to copyright issues surrounding music datasets—could add depth to the paper's integrity.

#### Conclusion

The paper presents MERT as a promising advance in the application of self-supervised learning to music understanding tasks. It offers significant contributions with novel methodologies, comprehensive evaluations, and plans for community contribution through open-source models. However, addressing the limitations around context length, performance inconsistencies in certain tasks, and ethical considerations would further strengthen the work. Overall, this contribution is likely to spur further research and development in the music understanding domain. 

**Recommendation**: Accept with minor revisions.
