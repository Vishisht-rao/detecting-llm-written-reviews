**Review of "TEXT-GUIDED DIFFUSION MODEL FOR 3D MOLECULE GENERATION"**

**Summary:**
The submitted paper presents TEDMol, a novel text-guided diffusion model for the generation of 3D molecular structures. The authors emphasize the limitations of existing diffusion models, particularly their reliance on single or a handful of property values for conditioning and argue that integrating textual guidance can enhance flexibility and expressiveness in addressing complex conditions. The approach is supported by experimental validation on the QM9 dataset and real-world textual data from PubChem, indicating the model's superiority over leading baselines in terms of stability, novelty, and alignment with desired molecular properties.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach:** The paper presents a compelling innovation in molecular generation by connecting advanced language models with diffusion processes. This combination allows for the flexible generation of molecular structures based on natural language descriptions, which is a significant advancement in the field.

2. **Strong Experimental Results:** The authors provide extensive experimental results showcasing TEDMol’s performance, indicating improvements over existing state-of-the-art models like EDM and EEGSDE across multiple metrics (MAE, novelty, and stability). The use of real-world data to validate their approach adds credibility to their claims.

3. **Comprehensive Background and Related Works:** The paper includes an informative background section that provides context to the study and clearly aligns TEDMol with existing literature. This comprehensive review of prior work helps in situating the new model as a relevant contribution to ongoing discussions in molecular generation.

4. **Detailed Methodology:** The description of TEDMol's mechanism for integrating textual prompts into the diffusion model is thorough and well-articulated, making the methodology accessible to readers.

5. **Potential Applications:** The authors effectively highlight the implications of their work for real-world applications such as drug discovery, emphasizing how TEDMol could expedite the exploration of molecular space.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Dataset Availability:** The authors acknowledge the limitation of high-quality data linking textual descriptions with 3D structures. While they briefly outline plans for future data curation efforts, a more detailed discussion on how to systematically obtain or generate such datasets would enhance the paper.

2. **Sampling Efficiency Concerns:** The slow sampling process due to the nature of iterative diffusion is highlighted as a bottleneck. Though this is acknowledged, the paper could benefit from discussing specific strategies or techniques that could potentially optimize sampling or speed up the process in practice.

3. **Applicability to Real-World Scenarios:** While the authors mention the need for conditioning on properties that can change post-training, they do not provide concrete solutions or methodologies to address this issue. A more detailed exploration of how TEDMol could adapt to dynamic conditions in real-life applications would strengthen the final sections of the paper.

4. **Comparison with Additional Baselines:** While the results are compelling, including a wider range of comparative baselines, including more recent innovations and models from adjacent areas, could provide a more robust evaluation of TEDMol's performance.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Inclusion of further experimental results demonstrating the generalizability of TEDMol across diverse datasets and its application in real-world scenarios.
- Exploration of optimization methods for improving the efficiency of the sampling process.
- A more detailed discussion regarding data acquisition strategies for generating high-quality text-molecular pairs, which could broaden the model’s applicability.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper introduces an innovative and well-supported framework for generating 3D molecular structures guided by text with TEDMol. It presents significant advancements in the field and opens pathways for future research. Addressing the noted weaknesses and suggestions could further enhance the impact of this work. Therefore, I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to ensure clarity and to expand on the discussed limitations.
