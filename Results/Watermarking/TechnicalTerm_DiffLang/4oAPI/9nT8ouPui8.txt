### Review of "On Memorization in Diffusion Models"

#### Summary
The paper presents a thorough investigation into the memorization behavior of diffusion models, particularly in relation to their training on various dataset sizes and configurations. The authors introduce a new metric termed Effective Model Memorization (EMM) to quantify the conditions under which diffusion models demonstrate memorization tendencies. Key findings indicate that diffusion models trained on smaller datasets tend to memorize data, while those trained on larger datasets exhibit stronger generalization capabilities. The authors further explore multiple factors influencing memorization, including data distribution, model configuration (size, depth, architecture choices), and the training procedure (batch size, learning rate, etc.). Notably, the study reveals that conditioning models on random labels can enhance memorization, a surprising find with implications for both practical use and theoretical understanding of diffusion models.

#### Strengths
1. **Research Relevance**: The investigation of memorization in generative models like diffusion models addresses a critical gap in the current literature. The implications of memorization behavior, particularly concerning privacy risks and data replication, are timely and significant.

2. **Methodological Rigor**: The paper employs a well-structured empirical approach. The introduction of EMM as a quantifiable metric for memorization is a valuable contribution, allowing for systematic study across different datasets and model configurations.

3. **Comprehensive Analysis**: The exploration of various influential factors on memorization is extensive. The analysis covers not only data distribution aspects (size, diversity) but also model architectural choices (skip connections, time embeddings). This holistic approach enriches the understanding of the dynamics at play.

4. **Surprising Findings**: The observation that conditioning models with random labels can trigger memorization behaviors is particularly intriguing and challenges conventional assumptions in the field, warranting further exploration and dialogue among researchers.

5. **Practical Implications**: By shedding light on the conditions that lead to memorization, the findings present practical implications for researchers and practitioners who deploy diffusion models in real-world applications, especially regarding data sensitivity and ethical considerations.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Clarity and Conciseness**: While the paper is rich in detail, certain sections could benefit from greater clarity. Some explanations, particularly around the theoretical framework and derivations, might be difficult for readers not deeply versed in the underlying mathematics to follow without additional context.

2. **Generalization Beyond CIFAR-10**: Despite the empirical focus on the CIFAR-10 dataset, the generalizability of findings to other types of datasets (e.g., high-dimensional or structured data) is not thoroughly addressed. Additional experiments on other datasets, like FFHQ, are mentioned but could be supplemented with more detailed comparisons to strengthen claims about the universality of the results.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**: The memorization criterion predominantly relies on nearest-neighbor distance metrics. While this is an established approach, it would be beneficial to explore other metrics (e.g., perceptual similarity scores) to validate memorization findings further.

#### Recommendations
- **Enhance Clarity**: Consider revising complex sections to enhance readability, especially for non-specialist readers. Simplifying certain mathematical derivations or providing more intuitive explanations could aid comprehension.

- **Broaden Experimental Scope**: To bolster claims of generalization, additional experiments on varied datasets beyond CIFAR-10 would be beneficial. This would provide a more robust foundation for the conclusions drawn.

- **Diverse Evaluation Metrics**: Exploring alternative definitions of memorization and complementary evaluation metrics could provide a more nuanced understanding of the memorization behaviors demonstrated by diffusion models.

#### Conclusion
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the understanding of memorization in diffusion models. The exploration of EMM offers a novel and useful tool for researchers in the field, and the empirical findings raise important considerations for the deployment of generative models. With some refinements in clarity and broader experimental validation, this paper has the potential to impact future research directions in deep generative modeling.
