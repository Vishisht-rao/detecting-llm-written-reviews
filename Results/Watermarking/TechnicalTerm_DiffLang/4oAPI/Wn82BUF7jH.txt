### Review of the Paper: "ON ACCELERATING DIFFUSION-BASED MOLECULAR CONFORMATION GENERATION IN SE(3)-INVARIANT SPACE"

#### Summary
This paper addresses the significant computational inefficiencies associated with diffusion-based generative models for molecular conformation generation, particularly in SE(3)-invariant spaces. The authors propose a novel acceleration scheme that aims to enhance the sampling process by correcting modeling errors in existing methods and introducing a new hyper-parameter. They provide both theoretical analysis and empirical validation demonstrating that their method can achieve a speedup of 50x to 100x compared to current approaches without sacrificing the quality of generated conformations.

#### Strengths
1. **Original Contribution**: The work effectively identifies a crucial bottleneck in the application of diffusion models for molecular conformation generation, which is the lengthy sampling process. The proposed acceleration scheme is novel and presents a meaningful advancement in the field.
2. **Comprehensive Theoretical Framework**: The paper provides an in-depth theoretical framework for the proposed model and the approximations used. The discussions around differential geometry and projected differential equations are particularly insightful and provide a solid basis for their methodology.
3. **Empirical Validation**: The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the proposed method's efficacy, achieving substantial speedups on well-known datasets (QM9 and Drugs). The metrics used for evaluation (COV, MAT) are appropriate and widely recognized in the field.
4. **Reproducibility**: The authors have made their code publicly available, which enhances the reproducibility of their results and facilitates further research.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Complexity of Implementation**: While the theoretical aspects are well-articulated, the actual implementation details might present challenges for practitioners less familiar with advanced concepts in differential geometry and probabilistic modeling. Providing additional clarity on the practical aspects of implementation could be beneficial.
2. **Limited Baseline Comparisons**: The comparison of the proposed method against only a single baseline (Langevin dynamics sampling) may raise questions regarding the thoroughness of the evaluation. Although the baseline is a standard method, further comparisons with alternative acceleration techniques, such as those based on consistency models, could have been included to provide a deeper insight into its advantages.
3. **Discussion on Hyper-parameter Sensitivity**: While the authors provide an analysis of their new hyper-parameter’s effect on the model’s performance, there could be a more in-depth discussion on the sensitivity of the chosen hyper-parameter and its implications in different molecular contexts.

#### Suggestions for Improvement
1. **Practical Guidelines for Implementation**: It would be helpful to include a section detailing practical guidelines for implementing the proposed method, particularly for users who might not be experts in the field.
2. **Comparative Analysis against Additional Methods**: Including comparisons against additional methods for accelerated sampling would strengthen the claims regarding the proposed method's superiority.
3. **Further Exploration of Hyper-parameter Effects**: Expanding the discussion on the sensitivity of the hyper-parameter (scale) to various conditions and configurations could provide further insights to users and researchers dealing with diverse molecular systems.

#### Conclusion
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the acceleration of diffusion-based molecular conformation generation within SE(3)-invariant spaces. The combination of theoretical rigor and empirical evidence offers a compelling case for the proposed method's effectiveness. Addressing the identified weaknesses could further enhance the manuscript's impact and utility. I recommend this paper for acceptance, given its potential to advance research in computational chemistry and related fields.
