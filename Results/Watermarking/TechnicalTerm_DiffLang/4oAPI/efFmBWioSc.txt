**Review of "Multimodal Web Navigation with Instruction-Finetuned Foundation Models"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel framework called WebGUM for autonomous web navigation that leverages multimodal foundation models, specifically integrating vision and language capabilities to interpret web interfaces. The authors propose a method for training web agents in an offline manner, using a dataset of high-quality demonstrations collected via instruction-following tasks. They claim significant performance improvements on benchmarks like MiniWoB and WebShop, outperforming both previous offline approaches and even some state-of-the-art online reinforcement learning (RL) models. Key contributions include the collection of a 347K multimodal dataset, enhancements in grounded multimodal perception, HTML understanding, and multi-step reasoning in web navigation tasks.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach:** The use of vision-language foundation models for web navigation is a timely and relevant advancement, especially as these models become more prevalent in AI applications.
2. **Strong Experimental Results:** The paper reports substantial performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods. The reported results on the MiniWoB and WebShop benchmarks provide strong empirical support for the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
3. **Large-Scale Dataset:** By collecting a sizeable multimodal dataset, the authors contribute valuable resources to the community that can facilitate further research in web navigation and interaction tasks.
4. **Thorough Ablation Studies:** The authors conduct extensive ablation studies that identify crucial components contributing to WebGUMâ€™s success, such as the importance of multimodal perception and instruction-tuning.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Clarification on Methodology:** Some sections of the methodology, especially those related to the dataset collection process and fine-tuning specifics, could benefit from increased clarity. Describing the nature of the human demonstrations and how the LLMs were leveraged could enhance reproducibility.
2. **Potential Limitations:** While the authors mention the framework's robustness to out-of-distribution samples and HTML perturbations, the experiments could explore edge cases or failure modes more comprehensively. Specific examples of these types of failures would aid in understanding the model's limitations.
3. **Real-World Applicability:** Although there is discussion about the potential application of WebGUM in real-world environments, it remains to be seen how well the model would perform outside of controlled benchmark settings. Further testing in real-world scenarios may be warranted.

**Technical Quality:**
The paper demonstrates high technical quality with well-structured results and thorough background research. The choice of models and methodologies appears justified and is supported by relevant literature. The findings are clearly presented, although technical terms may be densely packed for readers less familiar with the field.

**Overall Assessment:**
This paper presents noteworthy progress in the domain of autonomous web navigation by harnessing the power of instruction-finetuned multimodal models. The proposed WebGUM framework and the associated dataset are commendable contributions that could foster new research and applications. Addressing the noted weaknesses, especially concerning clarity and real-world applicability, could further strengthen the work and its impact. Overall, the paper is well-positioned for acceptance at ICLR 2024, given its innovative nature and solid empirical results.
