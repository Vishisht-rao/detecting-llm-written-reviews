### Review of "FLN ERF: 3D F ACIAL LANDMARKS ESTIMATION IN NEURAL RADIANCE FIELDS"

#### Summary
The paper presents FLNeRF, a novel model for the direct prediction of 3D facial landmarks on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). Through a coarse-to-fine framework, the authors claim that their method outperforms both single and multi-view image approaches, particularly in accurately detecting complex facial attributes. To bolster the model's capabilities, they utilize expression augmentation during training, thus addressing the nuances of facial expressions, including exaggerated emotions. The paper provides a qualitative and quantitative comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating FLNeRF's effectiveness in applications like face editing and swapping.

#### Strengths
1. **Novelty**: The direct incorporation of 3D facial landmark detection on NeRFs is a significant step forward, filling a notable gap in existing research. The method potentially reduces reliance on intermediate representations often seen in traditional modeling approaches.

2. **Coarse-to-Fine Approach**: The proposed coarse-to-fine methodology is commendable, allowing for initial localized predictions to be refined through detailed detection. This design appears beneficial for accurately capturing nuanced facial features.

3. **Expression Augmentation**: The introduction of expression augmentation in training is a strong point, as it enhances the dataset's diversity and potentially improves the model's generalization capabilities. This is crucial given the complexity of human facial expressions.

4. **Quantitative Results**: The paper provides extensive quantitative comparisons with previous models, demonstrating FLNeRF's superior performance in landmark detection across multiple expressions, establishing a robust baseline for future comparisons.

5. **Practical Applications**: The application of FLNeRF in face editing and swapping illustrates its practical potential, showing that the methodology can be beneficial beyond mere landmark detection, offering real-world utility.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Theoretical Justification**: While the framework is presented effectively, some theoretical justifications for choices made in architecture (e.g., the specific structure of the bilinear model vs. 3DMM, sampling choices) could be elaborated further. The rationale for some of the design decisions seems implicit rather than explicitly justified.

2. **Generalizability**: While the authors assert that the model can be generalized to in-the-wild images, further experimental validation on varied datasets outside of the controlled environments of Facescape could strengthen claims. Including a broader evaluation on diverse, real-world data captured under varied lighting and occlusions would enhance the paper's credibility.

3. **Computational Efficiency**: The computational requirements, including training time and resource usage compared to other methods, are not discussed extensively. An analysis here would help in understanding the practicality of FLNeRF for real-world applications.

4. **Comparison with Other Approaches**: While the paper does make comparisons with existing methods, there is a potential oversight in not contrasting FLNeRF against other emerging methods that may have similar objectives. A discussion on the advantages/disadvantages in contrast to these methods could provide additional depth.

5. **Ablation Study Details**: Although an ablation study is conducted, a clearer breakdown of the contributions of each component (coarse model, fine model, expression augmentation) to the final performance metrics would be beneficial. This would help elucidate what aspects of the design yield the most significant gains.

#### Overall Assessment
Overall, the paper represents a valuable contribution to the field of facial landmark detection within the context of Neural Radiance Fields. The methodological innovations and practical applications highlighted are promising. However, enhancements in the theoretical framework, evaluations on more diverse datasets, and clearer discussions about computational efficiency and comparisons with emerging methods would elevate the work. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions based on these considerations.
