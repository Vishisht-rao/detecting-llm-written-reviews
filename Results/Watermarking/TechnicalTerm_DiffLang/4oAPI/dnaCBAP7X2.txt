### Review of "ANIMPLICIT WATERMARK FRAMEWORK FOR ADVERSARY IDENTIFICATION"

#### Summary
The paper presents a novel framework aimed at identifying adversarial attacks in a white-box setting, wherein the adversary has full access to the model architecture and parameters. This paper builds upon the previous work by Cheng et al. (2023), which focused on black-box adversarial attacks, and attempts to address the challenges of identifying compromised model copies in a more open environment. The authors propose an implicit watermarking scheme that covertly integrates unique identifiers into the model during training, enabling effective tracking of adversarial examples generated by these models. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is evaluated through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures.

#### Strengths
1. **Novel Contribution**: The framework introduces an implicit watermarking approach that allows for adversarial identification without relying on explicit model modifications, which can be easily bypassed. This is particularly relevant in real-world applications where model access is high.
   
2. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The paper provides thorough empirical validation across a variety of attacks, datasets, and model architectures. The results demonstrate the framework's robustness and effectiveness, achieving high identification accuracy even with a single adversarial example.

3. **Clear Organization**: The structure of the paper is logical and well-organized, making it easy for the reader to follow the motivation, methodology, and results. The figures and tables effectively summarize key information.

4. **Real-World Relevance**: The focus on real-world scenarios where users have full access to models amplifies the practical implications of the proposed method, addressing a significant gap in the literature on adversarial attacks.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Limited Scope of Application**: The authors note that the framework may not be directly applicable to other machine learning tasks beyond image classification. This limitation could restrict its broader impact and utility in various domains.

2. **Potential Overfitting on Datasets**: Although the paper reports good performance metrics, there is little discussion on the potential for overfitting, especially given the finite number of fine-tuning samples used for watermark embedding in the context of diverse datasets.

3. **Adaptive Attack Evaluation**: While the experiments address the robustness of the watermarking framework against various adaptive attacks, the discussion could benefit from a deeper analysis of the limitations in adversarial identification amid multiple coordinated attacks versus a single adversary.

4. **Incomplete ablation studies**: Although some ablation studies are conducted, a more detailed analysis of the impact of varying parameters (e.g., choice of fingerprint classes and metrics used) on identification performance could provide additional insights into the framework's robustness and adaptability.

5. **Empirical Evidence for Claims**: The claims regarding the robustness of the watermarking scheme against removal methods could benefit from more quantitative evidence. While qualitative results are presented, robustness metrics with specific attack scenarios would strengthen the argument.

#### Suggestions for Improvement
1. **Expand Scope**: Consider discussing potential avenues for adapting the framework to other types of models and tasks, which could increase its applicability and interest to a broader audience.

2. **Additional Analyses**: Incorporate additional analyses on how the varying conditions affect the identification accuracy, potentially along with visual representations of how the model's performance changes under different settings.

3. **Broaden the Adversary Model**: Discussing how the framework could be extended or cautiously used when faced with sophisticated adversaries conducting multi-faceted attacks would add significant value.

4. **Robustness Metrics**: Enhance the evaluation of robustness by systematically exploring how the framework withstands various types of adversarial manipulations and providing empirical data to quantify this robustness.

#### Conclusion
This paper makes significant strides in advancing the field of adversarial identification by introducing an innovative implicit watermark framework. It effectively addresses critical challenges posed by white-box attacks and shows promising experimental results. However, the work would benefit from a broader application discussion, deeper analyses of its robustness, and further insights into overcoming challenges posed by intelligent adversaries. Overall, it is a commendable and timely contribution to the literature on adversarial machine learning.
