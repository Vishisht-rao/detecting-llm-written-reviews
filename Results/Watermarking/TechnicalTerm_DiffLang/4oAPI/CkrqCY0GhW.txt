**Review of the Paper: "Language Model Agents Suffer from Compositional Generalization in Web Automation"**

**Abstract and Introduction:**
The paper presents a compelling investigation into the performance of language model agents (LMAs) in the context of compositional generalization, specifically highlighting their challenges in web automation tasks. The authors introduce a novel benchmark, CompWoB, designed to evaluate the ability of LMAs to tackle multi-step decision-making tasks composed of simpler base tasks. The stark contrast between the agents' performance on base tasks and compositional tasks is a significant finding, with existing LMAs exhibiting a marked drop in success rate when faced with more complex instruction compositions. This contributes valuably to the growing body of literature concerned with the robustness and generalizability of LMAs in real-world applications.

**Contribution and Novelty:**
The main contributions of the paper are:
1. The introduction of the CompWoB benchmark, which is a significant advancement over existing benchmarks like MiniWoB as it incorporates task compositions resembling real-world applications.
2. A systematic evaluation of both prompted LMAs (e.g., GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) and transferred LMAs (models fine-tuned on base tasks) demonstrating the performance gap in handling compositional tasks.
3. The creation of a new model, HTML-T5++, that achieves human-level performance on MiniWoB and improved results on CompWoB.

The novelty lies in the comprehensive analysis of how instruction complexity affects LMA performance, particularly with the use of structured prompts and fine-tuning strategies. The insights provided could help in developing more robust LMAs for practical deployment.

**Methodology:**
The methodology is well-structured, beginning with the creation of controlled tasks followed by evaluations of various LMA frameworks. The empirical comparisons provide clear metrics on performance degradation with compositional tasks versus base tasks, which is critical for assessing generalization abilities. The authors also thoughtfully designed reverse-order instruction settings to further investigate the sensitivity of LMAs to instruction order, a factor often overlooked in similar studies. 

**Results:**
The results are substantial, especially the finding that prompted LMAs suffer a drastic drop from a 94% success rate on base tasks to approximately 24% on compositional tasks, while transferred LMAs show a smaller drop from 85% to 54%. Such insights underline the importance of compositional generalization in decision-making processes and validate the need for improved models to handle more complex task compositions.

The detailed failure analysis and examination of common pitfalls among LMAs (e.g., missing necessary steps, incorrect action types, hallucinations) strengthen the paperâ€™s impact by outlining practical challenges that need to be addressed in future research. 

**Discussion:**
The discussion is well-grounded and considers the broader implications of their findings. It suggests directions for future research, such as improved prompting strategies and the development of agent-specialized LLMs capable of handling complex operations. The authors rightly highlight the fragility of existing LMAs when given complex and ambiguous instructions, which is critical for real-world applications.

**Writing and Clarity:**
The paper is generally well-written and accessible, although there are a few typographical and formatting errors that detract from its professionalism (e.g., "multi-step decision making tasks" should be "multi-step decision-making tasks"). Nevertheless, the flow of the paper makes it easy to follow the logic and reasoning of the authors.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, this paper makes a significant contribution to the understanding of LMAs in web automation contexts. While the study highlights clear shortcomings in current model capabilities, it also opens avenues for future research aimed at enhancing the robustness and generalizability of LMAs. The meticulous analysis and practical benchmark it introduces are essential for advancing the field and addressing the real-world applicability of language model agents. 

**Recommendation:**
I recommend this paper for acceptance at ICLR 2024, with minor revisions focused on clarifying some methodologies and addressing the aforementioned typographical errors.
