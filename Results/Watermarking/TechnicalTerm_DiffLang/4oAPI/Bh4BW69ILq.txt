### Review of "Solving (Partial) Unbalanced Optimal Transport via Transform Coefficients and Beyond"

#### Overview
The paper presents an innovative approach to Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) and Partial Unbalanced Optimal Transport (PUOT) using a method based on transform coefficients. The authors argue that their method provides a more computationally efficient and interpretable solution compared to existing techniques, particularly those involving entropy regularization which results in dense mappings. They demonstrate that their approach not only facilitates the identification of marginal probability distributions but also allows for the transformation of UOT/PUOT problems into classical Optimal Transport (OT) problems.

#### Strengths
1. **Novelty**: The introduction of transform coefficients as a mechanism to address challenges in UOT is a commendable contribution to the field. By framing the problem differently, the authors open new avenues for computational efficiency and better interpretability.
  
2. **Clear Theoretical Foundations**: The paper provides a solid theoretical basis, including KKT optimal conditions and propositions that articulate how marginal probabilities can be deduced from the underlying problem structure without explicit calculation of the coupling matrix. The relationship established between UOT/PUOT and OT through the transform coefficients is well-articulated.

3. **Comprehensive Numerical Experiments**: The authors present a variety of numerical experiments that validate the efficacy of their proposed methods. These experiments cover several scenarios, including cases with outliers, and illustrate how the transform coefficients modify the sample weights.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: The empirical evaluation against existing methods (i.e., Regularization Path, Majorization-Minimization, and various OT solvers) showcases that the proposed approach is competitive in terms of both accuracy and computational cost.

5. **Real-World Application**: The application of the proposed method to Unsupervised Domain Adaptation demonstrates the practical implications and versatility of the approach, further validating its significance in applied contexts.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Clarity and Readability**: While the theoretical concepts are well explained, certain sections are overly dense, which may challenge readers who are not already familiar with optimal transport theory. Enhanced clarity, especially in the methodological sections, would benefit a broader readership.

2. **Lack of Extensive Real-World Benchmarking**: The paper primarily focuses on synthetic datasets for validation. More extensive testing on real-world datasets beyond UDA could further solidify the claims regarding the method’s robustness and applicability.

3. **Potential Over-reliance on Theoretical Properties**: Although the theoretical insights are compelling, the dependence on the correctness of these theoretical results (particularly regarding the transformation process) needs further empirical validation across diverse datasets to ascertain its universality.

4. **Computation of Hyperparameters**: The determination of hyperparameters, particularly τ and η in the experiments, is showed as empirical without a detailed heuristic or a theoretical framework guiding their selection. Providing insights or guidelines for hyperparameter tuning would enhance the practical usability of the method.

5. **Comparative Quantitative Results**: Although qualitative results were discussed, the quantitative benchmarks comparing their method with others using standardized metrics (beyond time complexity) could enhance the validity of their claims.

#### Conclusion
This paper makes a substantial contribution to the field of Optimal Transport by introducing a novel method for solving UOT and PUOT. The theoretical framework combined with empirical results demonstrates its merits effectively. However, the authors could strengthen their submission by enhancing the readability of complex sections, expanding their benchmarking, clarifying hyperparameter selections, and providing more quantitative comparisons against existing benchmarks. Overall, it presents exciting opportunities for future research in efficient optimal transport methods.
