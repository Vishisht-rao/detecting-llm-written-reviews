### Review of "Class Incremental Learning via Likelihood Ratio Based Task Prediction"

**Summary:**
The paper proposes a novel approach to Class Incremental Learning (CIL) called Task-id Prediction based on Likelihood Ratio (TPL), addressing the inherent challenges of CIL, particularly the issue of catastrophic forgetting and the difficulty of task-id prediction during inference. Unlike previous methods that rely solely on Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection, the TPL method utilizes available information in CIL settings, such as replay data, to improve task-id prediction. The authors argue that TPL significantly outperforms strong CIL baselines and exhibits negligible catastrophic forgetting.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach:** The proposal to combine likelihood ratio-based estimations with task-id prediction seems promising. By leveraging the common data distribution associated with learned tasks, the TPL effectively utilizes information that traditional OOD-based models disregard.
   
2. **Theoretical Justification:** The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation through theorems and statistical hypothesis testing concepts, establishing principles on how the likelihood ratio aids in achieving better task-id predictions.

3. **Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation:** The paper includes extensive experiments on multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, alongside robust baseline comparisons. The results strongly indicate that TPL outperforms several existing methods across different metrics.

4. **Forgetfulness Analysis:** The discussion on catastrophic forgetting presents a balanced evaluation of how TPL mitigates this issue effectively compared to existing methods.

5. **Implementation Transparency:** The paper offers a clear description of the methods, along with detailed algorithms for implementing TPL. It further provides the necessary appendices for reproduction.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Memory Buffer Dependency:** The reliance on a memory buffer to alleviate forgetting may present privacy concerns and necessitate extra storage, which could be a limitation in real-world applications. A discussion on the implications of this reliance could strengthen the paper.

2. **Limited Scope of Experiments:** While the experiments provide valuable insights, the paper primarily focuses on the traditional offline CIL setup. The adaptation of TPL to online CIL environments, where data is streamed and task boundaries are blurry, remains unexplored. This could leave a gap in applicability.

3. **Lack of Ablation Studies:** The paper could benefit from more detailed ablation studies to isolate the contributions of individual components of the proposed approach, helping to understand which aspects most significantly enhance performance.

4. **Performance Under Different Settings:** The paper mentions the use of TIL methods beyond HAT, but does not sufficiently discuss how these alternative methods impact TPL’s performance. Including such comparisons could provide greater clarity on its versatility across various architectural settings.

5. **Potential Overfitting to Benchmarks:** The experiments seem primarily benchmark-oriented. While showing improvements over baselines, the method's robustness in diverse application scenarios remains to be validated.

**Conclusion:**
This paper makes a commendable contribution to the field of continual learning with its novel TPL method for class-incremental learning. With its grounding in theory and strong empirical results, it promises to advance the understanding and practical implementation of CIL methods. However, the limitations regarding memory dependency, experimental scope, and interpretation of results suggest avenues for refinement and further research. Addressing these weaknesses in future work could solidify TPL's role as a robust solution in CIL contexts. 

**Recommendation:** Accept with minor revisions.
