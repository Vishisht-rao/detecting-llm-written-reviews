**Review of "YoooP: You Only Optimize One Prototype per Class for Non-Exemplar Incremental Learning"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel approach to class-incremental learning (CIL) called YoooP, which aims to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by optimizing a single prototype per class without relying on exemplar data. The authors introduce an attentional mean-shift algorithm to move each class prototype to a high-density region in the feature space while minimizing inter-class similarity. Additionally, they extend their method to YoooP+, which synthesizes replay data by preserving the angular distribution between prototypes and historical data. The authors provide extensive experimental results demonstrating that YoooP and YoooP+ outperform existing non-exemplar CIL methods in terms of accuracy and average forgetting.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Technique**: The introduction of an attentional mean-shift algorithm for prototype optimization is a significant contribution to the field of incremental learning. It addresses the challenges of inter-class interference effectively, which is a common issue in existing methods.
2. **Evaluation and Results**: The extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of YoooP and YoooP+. The results correlate well with the proposed methods' theoretical framework.
3. **Clear Comparisons with State-of-the-Art**: The paper systematically compares its proposed methods with a range of baseline techniques, both exemplar-based and non-exemplar-based, providing clarity on the advantages offered by YoooP and YoooP+.
4. **Detailed Analysis**: The inclusion of ablation studies to understand the influence of various components (such as prototype optimization and model interpolation) on performance adds depth to the evaluation.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Lack of Empirical Justification for Prototype Selection**: While the paper discusses prototype optimization thoroughly, it does not elaborate on the selection of prototypes during the initial training phase, which may affect generalization. Future work should investigate the impact of different initialization strategies on the final performance.
2. **Limited Exploration of Synthetic Data Generation**: Although YoooP+ synthesizes data based on angular distributions, the method's dependence on the quality of the original prototypes needs further discussion. An exploration of the sensitivity of the model's performance to the synthesis process and its potential pitfalls would strengthen the paper.
3. **Potential Overfitting to Recent Tasks**: The review acknowledges that YoooP tends to classify more into recent tasks. While YoooP+ mitigates this tendency, further investigation into the implications of prototype replay on older tasks would be beneficial.
4. **Framework Clarity**: While the proposed methods are well explained, some sections of the framework (e.g., the mathematical notations for losses) could be simplified or elaborated upon for clarity, especially for readers not deeply versed in the technical specifics.

**Minor Comments:**
- The references to existing literature are comprehensive but could benefit from clearer transitions to highlight how each cited work informed the current study.
- The figures and tables are generally well-presented; however, labeling could be improved for better readability, particularly for the legends in performance comparison graphs.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper provides a solid contribution to the field of class-incremental learning through its innovative non-exemplar approach. The experimental results support the superiority of YoooP and YoooP+ over existing frameworks, making it a valuable addition to CIL research. With minor revisions addressing the noted weaknesses, this work could make a significant impact on future incremental learning methodologies.
