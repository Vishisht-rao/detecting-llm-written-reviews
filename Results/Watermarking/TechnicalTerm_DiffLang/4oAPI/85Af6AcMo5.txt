**Review of "SciRE-Solver: Accelerating Diffusion Models Sampling with Score-integrand Solver and Recursive Difference"**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces a novel approach to accelerate the sampling process of diffusion models by proposing the "SciRE-Solver," which incorporates a new derivative estimation method known as the Recursive Difference (RD) method. The authors argue that traditional sampling methods based on finite difference (FD) are inadequate for effectively utilizing score function evaluations from complex neural networks. The empirical results demonstrate substantial improvements in the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) scores across multiple datasets, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods with reduced number of function evaluations (NFE).

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Methodology:** The introduction of the Recursive Difference method serves as a promising alternative to traditional methods for estimating derivatives in diffusion models. This innovation addresses a significant bottleneck in the field, which is the slow iterative sampling process.
   
2. **Extensive Empirical Evaluation:** The authors provide comprehensive experiments that show the effectiveness of SciRE-Solver. High-quality samples across datasets like CIFAR-10 and CelebA 64 ×64 are generated with drastically fewer NFEs compared to established methods.

3. **Clear Analyses and Theoretical Foundations:** The theoretical underpinnings of the proposed methods are laid out clearly, with derivations and proofs that enhance the reader's understanding of how the RD method improves derivative estimation. The proofs of convergence order provide strong assurances of the method’s robustness.

4. **Wide Applicability:** The framework presented is versatile and can adapt to various kinds of diffusion models, including continuous and discrete-time models, which underscores its potential relevance in diverse applications.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Technical Complexity:** While the paper provides thorough theoretical discussions, the complexity of the mathematical derivations may be difficult for readers not already familiar with diffusion models and numerical analysis. More intuitive explanations or diagrams could assist in making the content more accessible.

2. **Limited Baseline Comparisons:** Although the paper compares SciRE-Solver against other state-of-the-art methods, it primarily focuses on methods already established in the literature. Inclusion of more diverse baselines could provide a broader perspective on the improvement offered by the proposed approach.

3. **Lack of Real-World Applications:** While the empirical results are compelling in terms of image datasets, the paper lacks a discussion regarding the applicability of the method to real-world scenarios beyond synthetic datasets. Including practical applications would strengthen the case for the method's impact.

4. **Reproducibility Concerns:** The authors mention that experiments were run on specific hardware (NVIDIA TITAN X GPUs), but they do not provide sufficient details about the experimental setup, parameter choices, and code availability, which are crucial for reproducibility.

**Overall Impression:**
The paper presents a significant advancement in the domain of diffusion models through the introduction of a new derivative estimation approach that demonstrates robust performance in generating high-quality samples. While the method showcases excellent theoretical and empirical grounding, certain areas, such as accessibility, baseline comparison, and practical applications, could benefit from further elaboration. Nevertheless, the proposed SciRE-Solver has the potential to influence future research in this area substantially.

**Recommendation:**
I recommend acceptance pending minor revisions. The authors should consider clarifying complex mathematical details and providing a more comprehensive overview of the experimental setup and parameter choices used for all reported results.
