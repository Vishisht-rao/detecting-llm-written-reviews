### Review of "Diffusion Sampling with Momentum for Mitigating Divergence Artifacts"

#### Summary
The authors propose two novel techniques aimed at mitigating divergence artifacts during the diffusion sampling process in image generation models. The first technique introduces Polyak's Heavy Ball (HB) momentum into existing numerical methods for diffusion sampling to enhance stability regions. The second technique, Generalized Heavy Ball (GHVB), constructs a new high-order numerical method that allows for a variable trade-off between accuracy and artifact suppression. The experimental results indicate that both techniques significantly improve image quality while reducing artifacts compared to state-of-the-art diffusion solvers.

#### Strengths
1. **Innovative Approach**: The incorporation of momentum-based techniques into diffusion sampling is a novel contribution that brings insights from optimization into the realm of generative modeling. The use of Heavy Ball momentum is particularly well-motivated and theoretically sound.
   
2. **Thorough Theoretical Background**: The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation for understanding stability regions in numerical methods for ODEs, allowing readers to grasp why divergence artifacts occur. The definitions and explanations of key concepts are clear and concise.

3. **Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation**: The authors conduct extensive experiments evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed techniques across multiple diffusion models and conditions. The comparative analysis includes well-known state-of-the-art methods and provides a comprehensive view of the improvements in both qualitative and quantitative metrics.

4. **Clarity and Quality of Results Presentation**: The use of visual comparisons in figures enhances understanding. Results are presented clearly with adequate descriptions and insights, making it easy to follow the narrative of how the techniques perform across various scenarios.

5. **Practical Implications**: The findings may have significant implications for practitioners working on fast and high-quality image generation tasks, especially considering the growing interest in efficient diffusion models.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Limited Discussion on Generalization**: While the authors perform well in showing the effectiveness of their methods on specific models and datasets, the generalizability of their techniques to other settings or models is less clear. Future work should explore their application in diverse contexts or even in non-image generative tasks.

2. **Complexity of GHVB**: The GHVB method, while offering flexibility, could benefit from greater clarity on its complexity in implementation compared to conventional methods. Discussing potential computational overhead would help assess if the increased efficacy is worth the added complexity.

3. **Ablation Studies**: Although the results show the efficacy of both techniques, there is less focus on a systematic ablation study to dissect the contributions of various components. Detailed evaluations on how different parameters (e.g., guidance scale, momentum coefficient) affect performance would provide deeper insights.

4. **Performance Metrics**: While the authors leverage metrics like FID and LPIPS, further elaboration on why specific metrics were chosen and how they relate to the perceptual quality of images could enhance the reader's understanding.

5. **Discussion of Limitations**: Though the authors address implications, more emphasis could be placed on potential limitations or cases where the method may fail. A discussion of scenarios where artifacts might still arise would provide a more balanced view.

#### Conclusion
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of diffusion models by addressing a critical issue with clever and innovative approaches. The thorough theoretical and empirical analysis adds to its credibility and practical relevance. Future work may benefit from exploring the generalizability of the proposed methods, enhancing implementation clarity, and providing deeper insights through ablation studies. This work paves the way for innovations in fast and efficient image generation, making it a valuable addition to the ongoing discourse in generative modeling. I recommend this paper for presentation at ICLR 2024 with minor revisions.
