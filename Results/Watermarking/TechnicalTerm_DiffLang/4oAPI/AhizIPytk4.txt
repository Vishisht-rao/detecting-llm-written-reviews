**Review of "How Well Do Supervised 3D Models Transfer to Medical Imaging Tasks?"**

**General Overview:**
This paper presents significant advancements in the domain of transfer learning for medical imagery, particularly centered around the challenges presented by a lack of large-scale, annotated 3D datasets. The authors propose creating the AbdomenAtlas 1.1 dataset, which contains a substantial number of three-dimensional CT volumes, along with a suite of pre-trained models termed "SuPreM" for enhanced performance in various medical imaging tasks, especially segmentation tasks.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Dataset Creation:** 
   The introduction of AbdomenAtlas 1.1 is commendable. Comprising 9,262 CT volumes with per-voxel annotations spanning 25 anatomical structures is a remarkable contribution to the field. The dataset's comprehensiveness and diversity (sourced from 88 hospitals around the world) are essential for developing robust AI models and addressing the limitations of existing datasets.

2. **Clear Experimental Design:**
   The experiments performed to assess the transfer learning ability of supervised models demonstrate a thoughtful design. It effectively compares the performance of models trained on relatively small labeled datasets against those trained on larger unlabeled ones, providing valuable insights into the efficiency of supervised learning paradigms in medical applications.

3. **Detailed Performance Metrics:**
   The authors present their findings with well-structured data and benchmarks. Results indicate that the SuPreM models outperform prior state-of-the-art outcomes across multiple segmentation tasks, which adds considerable weight to their claims regarding the efficiency of supervised pre-training.

4. **Relevance to Medical Imaging Community:**
   The paper addresses a fundamental issue—the lack of large, annotated 3D datasets in medical imaging—making it particularly relevant to the medical imaging community, which can greatly benefit from more efficient and effective training protocols.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Comparison with Self-Supervised Models:**
   While the paper makes a strong case for supervised learning, it could be valuable to provide a more in-depth comparative analysis of self-supervised models alongside their supervised counterparts. The argument that supervised models inherently offer better transfer capabilities could benefit from acknowledging scenarios where self-supervised methods have shown promise, especially with extensive unlabeled datasets.

2. **Exploration of Transferability Limits:**
   The authors provide findings regarding the transferability of their models; however, more exploration into edge cases or limitations of their model transfers—especially for classes or datasets that are vastly different from AbdomenAtlas 1.1—would provide further clarity on the robustness and generalizability of their approach.

3. **Discussion of Potential Bias:**
   The paper could benefit from a discussion regarding the inherent biases present in the training data. Although the dataset is extensive, the reliance on a semi-automatic annotation process raises concerns about consistency in annotator bias. Investigating whether this bias could affect model performance in real-world scenarios would enrich the discussion section.

4. **Missing Direct Application Case Studies:**
   While the paper discusses the theoretical implications of their findings, inclusion of specific case studies or examples where the models have been successfully implemented in clinical settings would enhance its practical relevance and provide a real-world context to the research contributions.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of medical imaging, addressing the critical need for large, annotated datasets and demonstrating the effectiveness of supervised pre-training for 3D image segmentation tasks. However, deeper exploration into the nuances of transfer learning involving self-supervised methodologies and potential biases in dataset creation would strengthen the manuscript further. The research outlined here is crucial for paving the way towards improved AI applications in the healthcare sector, and its implications could be far-reaching in enhancing diagnostic capabilities and patient outcomes. 

I recommend acceptance of this paper with minor revisions.
