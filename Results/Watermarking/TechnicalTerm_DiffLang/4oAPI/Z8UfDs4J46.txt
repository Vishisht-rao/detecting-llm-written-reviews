**Review of the Paper: "Addressing Signal Delay in Deep Reinforcement Learning"**

**Overall Impression:**
This paper presents a significant and timely contribution to the field of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) by investigating the underexplored issue of signal delay. The authors effectively formalize the concept of Delayed-Observation Markov Decision Processes (DOMDP), demonstrating the impact of signal delays on the performance of existing DRL algorithms and proposing novel methods to mitigate these effects. The empirical results provided across various experiments are compelling, suggesting that the proposed approaches can achieve performance levels comparable to non-delayed scenarios.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Contribution:**
   - The identification and formalization of signal delay in DRL are well-justified. The authors highlight its prevalence in real-world applications, making a strong case for its consideration in the design of DRL algorithms.

2. **Comprehensive Framework:**
   - The paper introduces a comprehensive framework for addressing signal delays, which is crucial given the complexity of real-world environments. The definition of DOMDP expands the conventional MDP framework and offers a fresh perspective on partially observable environments.

3. **Empirical Validation:**
   - The experimental results are robust, utilizing a variety of DRL algorithms (e.g., DDPG, TD3, SAC) across multiple MuJoCo environments. The rigorous evaluation of the proposed methods demonstrates clear improvements over existing algorithms under both fixed and unfixed delay conditions.

4. **Practical Applications:**
   - The discussion around practical implications, such as in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and telemedicine, strengthens the relevance of the research. This work addresses a gap that could lead to significant advancements in deploying DRL systems in real-world scenarios.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Scope of Experiments:**
   - While the experiments cover a range of environments and delay settings, the focus on simulated robotic control tasks may limit the generalizability of the findings. The authors could strengthen their work by validating their methods in more diverse real-world tasks or domains.

2. **Complexity of Proposed Solutions:**
   - The proposed model interventions, while effective, introduce additional complexity. It would be beneficial for the authors to discuss the computational cost and potential overhead associated with implementing these strategies in practice, especially in time-sensitive applications.

3. **Clarity and Technical Depth:**
   - Some sections of the paper could benefit from clearer explanations, particularly in the mathematical formulations (e.g., Theorems 2.1 and 4.1). A more intuitive description of the underlying concepts may enhance accessibility for readers who may not be thoroughly familiar with the theoretical aspects.

4. **Comparison with Established Techniques:**
   - The authors briefly mention existing techniques designed to handle delays but do not provide sufficient contrast or benchmarking against these methods. An in-depth discussion and quantitative comparisons with alternative approaches would further highlight the advantages and potential limitations of the proposed methods.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, this paper makes a noteworthy contribution to the understanding of signal delay in deep reinforcement learning and offers effective strategies to address these challenges. The proposed approaches have the potential for broad application and impact in real-world settings. Addressing the weaknesses highlighted above could help to increase the clarity and applicability of the research. I recommend acceptance to the conference, pending minor revisions to enhance the depth and clarity of the discussion.
