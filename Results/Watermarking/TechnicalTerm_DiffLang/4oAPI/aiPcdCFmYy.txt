**Review of "Sinkhorn Distributional Reinforcement Learning"**

The paper introduces a novel approach in the domain of distributional reinforcement learning (RL) through the development of Sinkhorn Distributional RL (SinkhornDRL). This method utilizes Sinkhorn divergence to better capture the complexity of return distributions compared to existing methods that rely on quantile regression and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The authors provide a thorough theoretical grounding, empirically validate their approach over a suite of popular Atari games, and discuss the limitations and future directions for research.

### Strengths:

1. **Theoretical Contributions:** 
   - The paper effectively connects Sinkhorn divergence with both Wasserstein distance and MMD. By proving convergence properties in the tabular setting, the authors contribute a solid theoretical basis for understanding the behavior of SinkhornDRL. The equivalence established with a regularized MMD is particularly noteworthy, as it gives insight into the potential advantages of Sinkhorn divergence in approximating return distributions.

2. **Empirical Validation:** 
   - The authors conducted comprehensive experiments using 55 Atari games, demonstrating consistent performance improvements of SinkhornDRL over existing distributional algorithms, including QR-DQN and MMDDRL. This empirical success supports the theoretical claims made in the paper.

3. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - The paper performs a comparison with a variety of established methods, providing a clear analysis of SinkhornDRL's strengths and weaknesses. The sensitivity analysis regarding key hyperparameters, including the number of samples and the regularization parameter ε, is well-justified and adds depth to their empirical findings.

4. **Practical Relevance:**
   - The discussion about the implications of using Sinkhorn divergence for policy exploration, risk-sensitive control, and improved sample efficiency makes the results relevant to both theoretical and applied research in reinforcement learning.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Clarity and Conciseness:**
   - While the paper covers complex theoretical concepts, some sections could benefit from greater clarity. Certain mathematical notations and frameworks may be challenging, especially for readers not specialized in optimal transport theory. A more straightforward exposition of these ideas could enhance accessibility.

2. **Limited Perspectives on Future Work:**
   - Although the authors mention future explorations such as incorporating implicit generative models and cost function parameterization, the discussion on future directions is somewhat generic. It would be beneficial to explore more specific challenges or novel applications of SinkhornDRL that could spur further research.

3. **Complexity Considerations:**
   - The paper discusses computational costs and presents a comparative analysis; however, a detailed breakdown of the efficiency of Sinkhorn iterations in real-time training scenarios could provide a more nuanced understanding of the trade-offs involved. This aspect is crucial for practical implementations of the proposed algorithm, especially in more complex environments.

### Suggestions for Improvement:

- **Revisiting Clarity in Mathematical Derivations:** Refine the presentation of mathematical frameworks to enhance readability. Visual aids or additional explanations could facilitate comprehension for a broader audience.

- **Expanding Future Work Perspectives:** Elaborate on potential applications or extensions of SinkhornDRL. Discuss specific domains or tasks that could uniquely benefit from this approach to emphasize the method's versatility and applicability.

- **Detailed Computational Analysis:** Include a more comprehensive discussion on the computational efficiency and scalability of SinkhornDRL, focusing on its applicability in high-dimensional or continuous action spaces.

### Conclusion:

Overall, "Sinkhorn Distributional Reinforcement Learning" is a valuable contribution to the field of reinforcement learning, merging theoretical rigor with empirical evaluation. The proposed SinkhornDRL algorithm shows promise, and with some adjustments in presentation and depth of future work, it can become a key reference for researchers and practitioners in both reinforcement learning and optimal transport domains. I recommend acceptance of the paper with minor revisions to enhance clarity and complexity discussions.
