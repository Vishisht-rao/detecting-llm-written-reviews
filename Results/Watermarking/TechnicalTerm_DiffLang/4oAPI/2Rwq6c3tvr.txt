**Review of "Time Travel in LLMs: Tracing Data Contamination in Large Language Models" by Shahriar Golchin and Mihai Surdeanu**

**General Summary:**

The paper presents a significant and timely contribution to the field of natural language processing (NLP), specifically regarding large language models (LLMs) and the issue of data contamination. The authors propose a novel and practical method to identify instances of data contamination in LLMs, elucidating both instance-level and partition-level contamination detection. Their approach employs "guided instruction" to prompt LLMs for output and compares results to a baseline generated from "general instruction." The evaluation of their method is comprehensive, covering multiple datasets and utilizing both automated and expert human judgments to validate their findings.

**Strengths:**

1. **Relevance and Importance:** The paper tackles a pressing issue—data contamination—which has implications for the integrity and reliability of evaluations of LLMs. As LLMs become more prevalent in various applications, ensuring the validity of their performance is crucial.

2. **Methodological Innovation:** The authors introduce a clear and structured approach to identify contamination. Their methodology, which combines a guided prompting mechanism with evaluation heuristics, is both effective and efficient, demonstrating the potential for widespread application in similar contexts.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The experimental setup is robust, encompassing varied datasets (AG News, WNLI, XSum, etc.) and validation through human evaluations. The success rates of their contamination detection methods—between 92% to 100%—reflect a strong alignment with expert assessments, underscoring the reliability of their approach.

4. **Awareness of Limitations:** The authors appropriately acknowledge the limitations of their methods, including the inability to distinguish among different types of contamination and potential false positives. This transparency adds credibility to their work.

5. **Volume of Work:** Conducting experiments across 28 distinct scenarios using two prominent LLMs, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, significantly enhances the generalizability of their findings.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity and Clarity:** While the methodology is innovative, some sections could benefit from clearer explanations of the underlying concepts, particularly around the effectiveness of BLEURT and ROUGE-L metrics. The paper's depth may overwhelm readers unfamiliar with these techniques.

2. **Implementation Considerations:** The paper does not delve into potential implementation hurdles that researchers might encounter when applying the proposed methods in real-world scenarios. Discussing practical considerations could improve the utility of the work.

3. **Dependence on GPT-4:** The reliance on GPT-4 for final evaluations may raise questions about the approach's generalizability across other LLMs, especially if future models differ significantly in structure or training paradigms.

4. **Human Evaluation Bias:** The use of human evaluators to label data contamination presents a risk of bias. The authors could consider discussing this potential source of variability and might explore strategies to minimize it in future studies.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Clarification of Metrics:** A more detailed explanation of how BLEURT and ROUGE-L metrics relate to the task of contamination detection would benefit readers and enhance the perceived rigor of the approach.

2. **Broader Contextualization:** Including a section on the practical implications of data contamination in LLMs' deployments would emphasize the importance of the study further.

3. **Future Directions:** The authors could benefit from outlining potential future research avenues that build upon their findings, particularly in improving contamination detection methods or mitigating data contamination in various LLM architectures.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, this paper is a valuable addition to the ongoing discourse surrounding LLM integrity, offering novel insights and methodologies for identifying data contamination. Given the increasing reliance on LLMs across various domains, the implications of this research are significant. With some refinements in clarity and breadth, this work has the potential to serve as a foundational reference in the field. I recommend acceptance of this paper for presentation at ICLR 2024, and I look forward to seeing how this research evolves in future investigations.
