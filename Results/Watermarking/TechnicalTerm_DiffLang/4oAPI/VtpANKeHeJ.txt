### Review of "Strategic Classification with Unforeseeable Outcomes"

#### Summary

The paper presents a novel approach to strategic classification under conditions where individuals exhibit imitative behaviors, but the outcomes of their manipulations or improvements are uncertain. The authors challenge existing models, which generally assume that individuals can perfectly foresee the outcomes of their strategies and can alter their features at specific costs. Instead, they propose a probabilistic framework that captures strategic behavior within a Stackelberg game context, examining how decision-makers can adjust their policies to mitigate manipulation, incentivize genuine improvements, and promote fairness.

#### Strengths

1. **Novel Contributions**: The exploration of imitative strategic behavior with unforeseeable outcomes is a significant and timely contribution. The paper effectively fills a gap in the literature by integrating both manipulation and improvement into a unified framework.

2. **Theoretical Rigor**: The authors present a well-defined probabilistic model and a thorough mathematical formulation of the decision-making process. The decomposition of the objective differences between strategic and non-strategic policies into interpretable terms (ϕ₁, ϕ₂, ϕ₃) enhances the clarity of the decision-makers' preferences and behaviors.

3. **Practical Relevance**: By using relatable examples, such as college admissions, the authors effectively illustrate the real-world applicability of their model. This approach increases the paper's accessibility for practitioners and contributes to the broader dialogue surrounding ethical AI and algorithmic fairness.

4. **Empirical Validation**: The inclusion of experiments with both synthetic and real-world data (FICO score data) bolsters the claims made in the theoretical parts of the paper. The results show a clear demonstration of how adjusting preferences can lead to fairer outcomes while disincentivizing manipulation.

5. **Focus on Fairness**: The paper’s emphasis on algorithmic fairness is particularly commendable. The exploration of how preference adjustments can promote fairness across social groups is a critical issue in contemporary machine learning applications.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Complexity of Assumptions**: While the theoretical framework is robust, some assumptions may limit real-world applicability. For example, the assumption that manipulation can be detected only probabilistically might not hold in all contexts. Clarity on how these assumptions impact the findings would strengthen the discussion.

2. **Parameter Estimation Challenges**: Although the authors acknowledge potential challenges in estimating parameters like q and ϵ, the efficiency of their proposed estimation method could be elaborated further. Including specific methodologies or experiments on parameter sensitivity would be beneficial.

3. **Limitations Acknowledgment**: While limitations regarding model assumptions are briefly mentioned, a more in-depth discussion of the limitations and future work would enhance the paper. Potential alternative strategies for dealing with uncertainties in outcomes could be explored.

4. **Lack of Detailed Fairness Metrics**: The paper introduces fairness considerations but could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the fairness metrics used in experiments. Applying additional fairness measures or providing comparisons between them might enrich the results.

5. **Explicating the Impact of Individual Behavior**: The paper could further elucidate how the individual choices between manipulation and improvement directly affect the decision-maker's objectives beyond the structural framework presented.

#### Conclusion

Overall, "Strategic Classification with Unforeseeable Outcomes" presents a compelling and innovative framework that expands the understanding of strategic behavior in classification settings. The authors provide a strong theoretical foundation combined with empirical validation, making significant contributions to machine learning literature and ethical AI. With minor refinements, primarily in clearly addressing limitations and enhancing the discussions around fairness and assumptions, this work has the potential to be well-received at ICLR 2024. I recommend acceptance for presentation at the conference with minor revisions.
