**Review of "FLASHBACK: UNDERSTANDING AND MITIGATING FORGETTING IN FEDERATED LEARNING"**

**General Comments:**

The paper presents a comprehensive approach to address the critical problem of forgetting in Federated Learning (FL) under scenarios of high data heterogeneity. The authors introduce a novel algorithm called Flashback, which incorporates a dynamic knowledge distillation technique to effectively mitigate forgetting during both local and global updates. This research touches on an important issue in the FL community and promises to enhance the efficiency of FL algorithms, particularly in environments with highly heterogeneous data distributions.

**Strengths:**

1. **Identification of a Significant Problem:** The authors successfully identify forgetting as a key issue in FL, especially as it relates to data heterogeneity. This coherence with the challenges of catastrophic forgetting in continual learning is well articulated.

2. **Novel Metric for Forgetting:** The introduction of new metrics for measuring both global and local forgetting is a notable contribution, as it allows for more granular analysis compared to previous methodologies.

3. **Innovative Algorithm Design:** The Flashback algorithm is well-described and conceptually compelling, allowing for dynamic adjustments based on the label counts of classes. This adaptive approach appears to offer a meaningful advantage over existing methodologies.

4. **Extensive Empirical Evaluation:** The paper includes comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets, demonstrating not only the efficacy of Flashback in terms of convergence speed but also providing detailed insights into the reduction of forgetting.

5. **Integration of Related Work:** The authors effectively contextualize their work within existing literature, detailing how Flashback differs from and builds upon previous approaches like FedAvg, FedProx, and FedNTD.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Public Dataset Dependency:** While the authors acknowledge the requirement for a public dataset to perform distillation at the aggregation step, the implications of this dependency could be further elaborated. The effect of the dataset's size and diversity on the efficacy of the Flashback algorithm could be a concern in practical applications.

2. **Discussion on Cost Implications:** While the authors mention that the computational cost of Flashback is minimal in the context of existing methods, more quantitative analysis or clarification on the actual cost representation (in terms of time, memory, etc.) would strengthen the discussion.

3. **Potential for Overfitting on Local Updates:** The dynamic distillation approach, while advantageous for knowledge retention, also runs the risk of overfitting to the idiosyncrasies of local data distributions. Addressing how Flashback manages this risk or providing theoretical guarantees could enhance the robustness of the proposed method.

4. **Limited Baseline Comparisons:** Although the paper compares Flashback against several prominent baselines, including some novel methods that address forgetting, it could benefit from additional baseline methods, particularly those that have demonstrated diverse strategies in the FL context.

**Minor Points:**

- The figures and tables, while informative, could benefit from clearer labeling and descriptions to enhance understanding.
- The writing can occasionally be verbose, and certain sections could be more concise for improved clarity.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the ongoing research in Federated Learning by tackling the important issue of forgetting. The proposed Flashback algorithm and its accompanying metrics are innovative and well-supported by experimental findings. With minor improvements in addressing weaknesses highlighted above, this work has the potential to influence future research and applications in Federated Learning. I recommend acceptance, pending minor revisions.
