**Review of "Regularized KL Divergence for Well-Defined Function Space Variational Inference in BNNs"**

**Summary:**
The authors propose a novel approach to variational inference within Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) that addresses significant issues associated with function-space variational inference (FSVI). The paper centers around the use of a regularized Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence metric that is well-defined in function space, enabling the incorporation of Gaussian process (GP) priors directly onto the functions rather than the weights. The authors argue that traditional FSVI methods often lead to infinite KL divergence when applying non-degenerate GP priors, which severely affects the applicability of these methods. Through a combination of linearized BNNs and generalized variational inference, the proposed method (GFSVI) effectively circumvents these limitations. The paper provides extensive empirical validation, both qualitatively on synthetic datasets and quantitatively on several real-world datasets, demonstrating that GFSVI approximates the true GP posterior more faithfully and offers competitive performance in regression and out-of-distribution detection tasks.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Contribution:** The introduction of the regularized KL divergence as a solution to the infinite divergence problem in function-space variational inference is a significant intellectual contribution. This advance facilitates the practical application of BNNs in scenarios where informative function-space priors are crucial.

2. **Rigorous Theoretical Justification:** The paper thoroughly discusses the limitations of existing methods and provides a sound theoretical basis for the proposed approach. The explanation of how and why existing FSVI methods face issues related to KL divergences adds to the paper's depth.

3. **Comprehensive Experimental Validation:** The empirical results presented are robust, showcasing the effectiveness of GFSVI across various scenarios, including synthetic and real-world datasets. The comparative analysis against multiple baselines (including both function-space and weight-space inference methods) adds credibility to the claims made.

4. **Clear Structure and Presentation:** The paper is well-organized, with a logical flow from the introductions of issues to the proposed solution and empirical validation. This clarity facilitates reader understanding, especially in the context of complex mathematical concepts.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Scope of Experiments:** While the paper includes various datasets, the exploration of the proposed method in classification tasks is notably absent. As the authors themselves suggest in the discussion section, extending the application of GFSVI to classification could add further interest and utility to the method and its validation.

2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The proposed method involves additional hyperparameters (e.g., Î³), whose optimal settings may not be immediately clear to users unfamiliar with the intricacies of GP priors. Further discussion on the robustness of hyperparameter choices and their impact on performance could enhance the applicability of the method.

3. **Potential Practical Limitations:** The complexity of the method, specifically the requirement for Gaussian measures and the estimation of KL divergences, may pose challenges for practitioners seeking straightforward applications of Bayesian deep learning methods. A more explicit discussion about practical limitations or considerations when utilizing GFSVI would strengthen the paper.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper presents a significant advancement in the field of Bayesian inference in neural networks, particularly concerning function-space variational inference with Gaussian process priors. The introduction of the regularized KL divergence is both innovative and practically important. The extensive experimental validation underscores the strength of the proposed method, despite potential limitations in hyperparameter tuning and applicability to classification tasks. The contributions made in this paper are likely to be valuable for researchers and practitioners working in Bayesian deep learning and related domains. 

**Recommendation:** 
I recommend acceptance of this paper for presentation at ICLR 2024, with minor revisions to address the identified weaknesses and potentially enhance the clarity of hyperparameter implications and applicability.
