**Review of "NOWRONG TURNS: THE SIMPLE GEOMETRY OF NEURAL NETWORKS OPTIMIZATION PATHS"**

**Paper Overview:**
This paper presents an insightful examination of the optimization dynamics in deep neural networks, focusing on the geometric properties of sampled gradients along optimization paths. The authors investigate the behavior of two key quantities involved in first-order optimization—Restricted Secant Inequality (RSI) and Error Bound (EB)—uncovering predictable patterns that challenge traditional assumptions about the non-convexity and complexity of neural loss landscapes. They support their theoretical insights with extensive empirical experiments across various tasks and architectures.

**Strengths:**
1. **Theoretical Contribution:** The paper contributes to the understanding of neural network optimization by providing a mathematical characterization of the optimization paths and their geometric properties. The exploration of RSI and EB leads to a more nuanced view of the optimization landscape, proposing that it may be simpler than previously believed.

2. **Extensive Empirical Validation:** The authors conduct a wide range of experiments across different tasks—image classification, language modeling, and semantic segmentation—using various architectures and optimization strategies. This diversity strengthens the conclusions drawn from the analysis and demonstrates the robustness of the observed phenomena.

3. **Practical Implications:** The findings have practical relevance, especially in informing learning rate schedules that align with observed behavior, which is likely to be beneficial for the application of these insights in real-world scenarios.

4. **Comprehensive Discussion of Related Work:** The paper does a commendable job of situating its findings within the existing body of literature on neural network optimization and loss landscapes. This context is crucial for understanding the significance of the study's contributions.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Assumption of Smoothness:** While the authors claim to sidestep the traditional assumption of smoothness, they still operate under the premise of almost-everywhere differentiability. The implications of relaxing smoothness assumptions could be discussed in greater detail, particularly in how it affects theoretical guarantees and empirical observables.

2. **Interpretability of Metrics:** The paper employs RSI and EB as core metrics, but there may be a lack of intuitive understanding for the broader community on the implications of these metrics in practical optimization scenarios. Additional qualitative explanations could enhance the usability of these concepts for practitioners.

3. **Biases in Experimental Design:** The method of using the final iterate as a reference point introduces potential biases into the results and conclusions (as noted in the paper). While the authors recognize this limitation, further discussion on how to mitigate such bias in future works or alternative approaches would strengthen the analysis.

4. **Generalization of Findings:** While the results yield significant insights, the generalizability of RSI and EB across all neural network architectures and tasks remains an open question. More discussion on how these findings might be applicable to less common network structures or novel tasks would be beneficial.

**Overall Impression:**
The paper presents a compelling narrative on the unexpected simplicity of neuronal loss landscapes when viewed through the lens of geometric properties. By bridging theoretical insights with operational practices in neural network training, the authors advance the understanding of optimization dynamics in deep learning. I recommend accepting the paper with minor revisions to address the outlined weaknesses, particularly regarding assumptions and the derivative biases inherent in the experimental design.

**Recommendation:**
Accept with minor revisions.
