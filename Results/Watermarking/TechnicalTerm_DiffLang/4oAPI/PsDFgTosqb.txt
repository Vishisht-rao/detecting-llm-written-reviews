**Review of "Learning to Solve Bilevel Programs with Binary Tender"**

**Summary:**
The paper investigates the solution of bilevel programming (BP), particularly focusing on BPs that involve discrete decision variables. Traditional approaches struggle with computational intractability in such scenarios, prompting the authors to propose a novel method utilizing deep learning techniques. The authors introduce a framework that employs neural networks—general neural networks (GNN) and a new architecture termed Input Supermodular Neural Network (ISNN)—to approximate the value function of the lower-level problem. They further enhance solution quality through an enhanced sampling method, ultimately reformulating the BP into a single-level mixed-integer representation that can be solved using off-the-shelf solvers.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Approach**: The paper addresses an important gap in the literature concerning BPs with discrete decision variables, applying machine learning techniques to enhance the solution processes. The use of neural networks to approximate the value function is innovative and relevant to ongoing discussions in optimization and machine learning.
   
2. **Theoretical Contributions**: The authors provide significant theoretical insights, particularly around the properties of ISNN, including its supermodularity. This theoretical underpinning enhances the robustness of the proposed methodologies and provides a solid foundation for further exploration.
   
3. **Extensive Numerical Experiments**: The paper features extensive numerical experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods compared to a state-of-the-art solver (MiBS). The results illustrate clear performance advantages, particularly as problem dimensions increase, highlighting the practical utility of the proposed approaches.

4. **Clarity and Organization**: The structure of the manuscript is logical, with clear delineation between sections. The methodologies are well-described, making it accessible for future researchers who may want to replicate or build on this work.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Generalization**: While the method demonstrates impressive results on the problem instances considered, the paper could benefit from a broader analysis of how universally applicable the proposed approach is across different types of bilevel programs, particularly those with more complex constraints or non-linear components.

2. **Sampling Efficiency Discussion**: The discussion surrounding the sampling methods could be expanded. While the enhanced sampling method shows promising results, insights into the design choices and any computational trade-offs compared to traditional methods could provide more context regarding its advantages.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: Although the paper compares GNN and ISNN, the paper lacks a comprehensive analysis of their respective performance with diverse problem settings and under varying conditions. Insights into when one method might outperform the other in specific scenarios could enrich the paper.

4. **Experiment Reproducibility**: While the authors mention that all experiments were conducted under controlled conditions, providing a more detailed account of the experimental setup—including hyperparameter values, initialization specifics, and computational resources—would enhance reproducibility.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. Expand the theoretical discussion to explore the limitations of the methods under different problem structures and enhance the understanding of the generalization of the proposed approach.

2. Provide additional comparative studies of GNN and ISNN across a wider variety of test cases to illustrate their relative advantages and limitations better.

3. Elaborate on the sampling techniques, focusing on how the enhanced sampling benefits differ from standard methods in practical applications.

4. Include a supplementary materials section with more detailed descriptions of experiments to aid reproducibility.

**Conclusion:**
This paper presents a compelling approach to solving bilevel programs with binary tender through innovative application of neural networks and sampling techniques. It makes valuable contributions to both the fields of optimization and machine learning. Addressing the outlined weaknesses could further strengthen the study, potentially leading to impactful advancements in the effective use of learning techniques for solving complex optimization problems. Overall, I recommend the acceptance of this paper with minor revisions.
