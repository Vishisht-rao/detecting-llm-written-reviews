### Review of the Paper "Accelerated Policy Gradient: On the Nesterov Momentum for Reinforcement Learning"

**Summary:**
The authors present a novel reinforcement learning approach termed Accelerated Policy Gradient (APG), which incorporates Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG) method into policy optimization. The primary goal is to improve the convergence rate of policy gradient methods from \(\Theta(1/t)\) to \(\tilde{O}(1/t^2)\) in the context of reinforcement learning (RL). The paper extensively analyzes the global convergence properties of APG under softmax policy parameterization, emphasizes key theoretical insights such as the local near-concavity of the RL objective function, and backs theoretical claims with numerical simulations across different settings.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Contribution:** This paper is the first to apply the NAG framework to reinforcement learning, demonstrating a significant theoretical advancement by achieving a faster convergence rate. The clarity with which this unique angle is presented is commendable.
  
2. **Thorough Theoretical Analysis:** The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges encountered in combining NAG with RL. They effectively address how the non-convexity of RL objectives complicates the analysis of convergence rates. The proofs are detailed and well-structured, giving the reader clear insights into the assumptions and results.

3. **Empirical Validation:** The paper includes extensive numerical simulations, validating the theoretical findings. The performance comparisons between APG and standard policy gradient methods, as well as heavy-ball methods, provide practical relevance to the theoretical claims and illustrate the benefits of using momentum.

4. **Discussion of Related Works:** The authors successfully contextualize their work within the existing literature, showcasing an understanding of the landscape of RL optimization strategies and where their method fits. 

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity of Presentation:** While the paper presents significant theoretical groundwork, some sections, especially the proofs and derivations (Section 5 and 6), could be overwhelming for readers not well-versed in advanced optimization and convex analysis. Simplifying the notation or providing a more intuitive explanation of the key concepts could enhance accessibility.

2. **Limited Scope of Experiments:** Although the numerical validation is promising, it predominantly focuses on simulated environments (bandits and MDPs) without deeper exploration in more complex RL tasks from benchmark environments, such as those available in OpenAI Gym. Real-world applications or scalability in diverse scenarios would strengthen the evaluative aspect of the paper.

3. **Handling of Stochasticity:** The paper centers on the use of true gradients, yet real-world RL contexts often involve stochasticity. While there is some mention of an extension to stochastic gradients, more in-depth exploration of how APG could handle noisy feedback would have added value.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- **Clarity in Presentation:** Consider breaking down complex proof sections with more illustrative examples, further clarifying how key results connect with the main contributions of APG.
  
- **Broader Experimental Context:** Expanding empirical tests to include a variety of environments (like continuous action spaces) and comparison against state-of-the-art methods in those domains would provide additional validation of the proposed method’s efficacy.

- **Address Stochastic Environments:** Future works could explore how the APG framework could be adapted to effectively deal with stochastic gradients and maximize efficiency in practical applications.

**Conclusion:**
The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning by blending classical optimization techniques with modern RL strategies. The improvement in convergence rates is an exciting development, and while the theoretical and empirical results are strong, greater clarity and broader testing would enhance the impact of this work. The findings could inspire further research into momentum approaches in RL and potentially establish frameworks that extend beyond the current limitations of policy gradient methods. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the outlined weaknesses.
