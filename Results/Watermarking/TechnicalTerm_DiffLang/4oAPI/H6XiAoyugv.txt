**Review of "ROBUST BACKDOOR ATTACK WITH VISIBLE, SEMANTIC, SAMPLE-SPECIFIC AND COMPATIBLE TRIGGERS"**

**Summary:**
The submitted paper presents a novel backdoor attack method referred to as the Visible, Semantic, Sample-Specific, and Compatible (VSSC) trigger. This approach aims to overcome the limitations of existing backdoor attacks, especially regarding the trade-off between trigger visibility and robustness to visual distortions. By utilizing large language models for trigger selection and employing text-guided image editing techniques, the authors propose a method that is not only effective in digital realms but also demonstrates resilience in physical environments. The paper includes extensive experimental results supporting the claims of enhanced effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness of the VSSC trigger compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty and Relevance:** The problem addressed—ensuring the robustness of backdoor attacks against visual distortions while maintaining stealthiness—is timely and relevant in the security domain of deep learning models. The introduction of the VSSC trigger shows innovation in the design of backdoor attacks.
   
2. **Methodological Rigor:** The paper outlines a well-defined methodology, including an automated pipeline for trigger selection and poison image generation, and provides a thorough explanation of the components involved in the attack process. The use of large language models and modern editing techniques reflects a forward-thinking approach.

3. **Extensive Evaluation:** The authors conduct comprehensive experiments on two challenging datasets (ImageNet-Dogs and FOOD-11) to validate their proposed method. The empirical results demonstrate superior performance metrics, such as attack success rate (ASR) and clean accuracy.

4. **Robustness Under Distortions:** The experiments illustrate that the proposed approach can sustain high effectiveness under various forms of visual distortion both in digital and physical contexts, which further enhances its practical applicability.

5. **Clear Presentation and Analysis:** The organization of the paper is logical and well-structured, facilitating easy navigation through the introduction, methodology, experiments, and discussions.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Generalization Concerns:** While the paper demonstrates promising results within the selected datasets, it would benefit from further testing across a broader range of datasets and real-world conditions to gauge the true generalization capability of the VSSC trigger. The reliance on a specific dataset might limit the conclusions drawn.

2. **Empirical Comparisons:** While comparisons with existing SOTA methods are provided, including a variety of attack scenarios, a more in-depth analysis of specific failure modes and conditions under which the VSSC trigger might underperform would add depth to the evaluation. For example, further qualitative assessments on the trigger's visibility in different contexts would be insightful.

3. **Potential Ethical Implications:** The exploration of backdoor attacks raises ethical concerns regarding their misuse. Although it’s critical to understand and improve defenses against such attacks, a discussion on the ethical implications and proposed mitigations could enhance the paper's impact and responsibility.

4. **Human Inspection Study:** The human perception analysis indicates an average success fooling rate of around 51.3%. This could be further reinforced with a more comprehensive study involving a larger and more diverse participant pool to validate the findings.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper provides substantial contributions to the research in backdoor attacks in deep learning, presenting a well-justified method that is both innovative and effective. While it presents promising results and robust methodologies, addressing the generalization of findings, detailed analysis of failures, and ethical considerations will enhance its impact and relevance. I recommend the paper for acceptance with minor revisions to address the raised concerns.
