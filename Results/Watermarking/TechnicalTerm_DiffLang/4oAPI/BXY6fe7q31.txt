### Review of the Paper: "Fine-tuning Multimodal LLMs to Follow Zero-Shot Demonstrative Instructions"

#### Summary

The submitted paper presents a novel approach to enhance the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in understanding and executing complex, interleaved instructions through the introduction of a lightweight Visual Prompt Generator Complete (VPG-C) and a synthetic discriminative training strategy. The authors assert that traditional VPGs, trained primarily on image-caption pairs, tend to overlook crucial visual details necessary for interpreting demonstrative instructions. Therefore, by fine-tuning VPG-C without the need for extensive annotated data, the paper claims significant improvements in zero-shot performance across a new benchmark called DEMON.

#### Strengths

1. **Novel Contribution**: The introduction of VPG-C is a significant advancement in the field of multimodal understanding. It addresses the limitations of existing VPGs that primarily focus on only primary visual areas rather than intricate details that may be contextually required for task completion. This innovation offers a pragmatic solution to improved instruction-following capabilities in models exposed to multimodal inputs.

2. **Synthetic Discriminative Training**: The proposed training strategy, which eliminates the need for expansive datasets of labeled demonstrative instructions, shows promise for efficiency in terms of both data and computational resources. The results suggest that synthetic training can effectively enhance model performance without necessitating cumbersome data collection efforts.

3. **Comprehensive Benchmark (DEMON)**: The authors provide a rigorously designed benchmark that evaluates various aspects of demonstrative instruction-following. The detailed categorization of tasks, which covers diverse scenarios, adds robustness to their evaluations and serves as a useful resource for future research in MLLMs.

4. **Empirical Validation**: The experimental results showcase substantial improvements of the VPG-C over existing state-of-the-art models across several benchmarks (DEMON, MME, and OwlEval), which is commendable. This rigorous evaluation strengthens the reliability of their claims and contributes to its credibility.

5. **User Accessibility**: The authors have provided open access to their code and models, which enhances the potential for further research and application within the community.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Lack of Justification for Choices**: While the paper details the methodology and components of VPG-C, it could benefit from a deeper discussion and justification of why certain architectural choices were made. For instance, why the authors selected specific layers for the integration of visual residuals could be better explained for clarity.

2. **Limited Discussion on Generalization**: Although the paper provides evidence of improved performance, it would benefit from a more thorough discussion on the generalizability of VPG-C across different datasets and tasks. Future work should analyze how VPG-C may perform on data distributions that differ from those used during training.

3. **Potential Overfitting Concerns**: The study reports that the synthetic training data used can lead to marginal performance gains after a certain point. The authors could further explore potential overfitting issues associated with the synthetic generator and discuss methods for mitigating this, ensuring that models remain robust against unseen or diverse inputs.

4. **Visualize Results Clearly**: While qualitative examples demonstrated the model's capability, the presentation of these examples could be streamlined for clarity. The formatting and readability of the qualitative results could be improved to help the reader digest the comparisons more effectively.

5. **Broader Context and Implications**: The discussion surrounding the implications of their findings on future MLLMs and potential applications of the VPG-C approach could be expanded. How can this work influence real-world tasks or applications that require understanding complex multimodal inputs?

#### Conclusion

Overall, the paper is well-structured and presents a significant contribution to the field of multimodal learning. It addresses an important challenge faced by existing models and proposes an innovative solution that appears effective based on the experimental results. With minor enhancements, particularly in justifying design choices and expanding the discussion of implications and generalization, this work has the potential to influence future research in multimodal LLMs significantly. I recommend acceptance for presentation at the ICLR 2024 conference.
