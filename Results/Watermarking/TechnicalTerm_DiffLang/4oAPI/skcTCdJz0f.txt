**Review of the Paper: "Probabilistic Self-Supervised Learning via Scoring Rules Minimization"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents ProSMin, a novel probabilistic self-supervised learning framework that aims to mitigate the problem of dimensional collapse encountered in current self-supervised methods. The authors propose a method that leverages probabilistic models and scoring rules to enhance representation quality. Specifically, they introduce an objective function based on proper scoring rules and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach across various downstream tasks, including in-distribution generalization, out-of-distribution detection, and others. The empirical results indicate superiority over several state-of-the-art self-supervised learning baselines, suggesting improvements in both accuracy and calibration.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Contribution**: The introduction of a probabilistic framework that addresses representation collapse with a theoretical foundation is a significant contribution to the field. The use of scoring rules to guide representation learning is an innovative approach that is well-justified within the context of the paper.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The authors have conducted extensive experiments across multiple datasets (e.g., ImageNet-O, ImageNet-C) and tasks (e.g., IND generalization, OOD detection). This breadth of evaluation strengthens the validity of their claims regarding the robustness and effectiveness of ProSMin.

3. **Theoretical Insights**: The paper provides a rigorous theoretical justification for the proposed method, linking the optimization process with probabilistic principles. This aspect is crucial for the reproducibility of results and enhances the scientific rigor of the contribution.

4. **Public Code Availability**: The decision to make the code publicly available is commendable as it promotes transparency and encourages further research in this area.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity of the Method**: While the introduction of probabilistic modeling and the scoring rule is a significant advancement, the added complexity may hinder the practical application of the method. The paper could benefit from a clearer explanation of the conditions under which ProSMin excels and any potential limitations in simpler scenarios.

2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: The performance of the method appears sensitive to certain hyperparameters, such as the ones governing the scoring rule. An ablation study addressing the effects of these parameters in more detail could enhance the understanding of the method's operational dynamics.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: While the paper presents results relative to existing self-supervised methods, it would be beneficial to include a more detailed analysis of the specific advantages and disadvantages of ProSMin in practical applications. For instance, how does the computational overhead associated with ProSMin compare with the baselines?

4. **Broader Impact and Limitations Discussion**: The conclusion section briefly mentions limitations, but it could be expanded. For example, the authors could discuss the implications of needing large computational resources and the potential accessibility issues for researchers with limited means.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of self-supervised learning by addressing a well-known problem using innovative techniques grounded in probabilistic theory. The empirical validation is robust, affirming the efficacy of the proposed approach. Future work could focus on simplifying the method for practical applications and further analyzing the hyperparameter landscape to bolster its applicability across diverse scenarios. Recommended for acceptance with minor revisions to enhance clarity and depth in certain areas.
