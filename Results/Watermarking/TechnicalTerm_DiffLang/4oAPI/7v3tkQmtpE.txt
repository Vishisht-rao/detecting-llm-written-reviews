**Review of "RETHINKING DECISION TRANSFORMER VIA HIERARCHICAL REINFORCEMENT LEARNING"**

**Summary:**
This paper proposes a novel framework, termed Autotuned Decision Transformer (ADT), to enhance the Decision Transformer (DT) by integrating Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) principles. The authors identify critical limitations in DT, primarily its reliance on memorization of trajectories for decision-making and its inefficacy in stitching together suboptimal trajectories. ADT introduces a hierarchical approach where a high-level policy prompts a low-level policy to act based on both prompt and state information. The paper presents two variations of ADT—Value-prompted and Goal-prompted ADT—and demonstrates through empirical evaluations that these variations outperform DT in various benchmark tasks, suggesting that attention to prompt design significantly impacts performance.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Contributions**: The hierarchical structure introduced in ADT is innovative and addresses key shortcomings of the original DT model. The separation of high-level prompts from low-level action decisions is a meaningful advancement and aligns well with HRL concepts.
  
2. **Empirical Results**: The empirical validation is robust, with results showing significant improvements over DT and other competing methods across diverse environments (MuJoCo, AntMaze, and Franka Kitchen). The inclusion of ablation studies enriches the findings and demonstrates the importance of specific design choices in the proposed algorithms.

3. **Theoretical Insights**: The authors effectively articulate the theoretical underpinnings behind the limitations observed in DT. By providing a clear explanation of the issues related to prompt usage and the data distribution challenges, the work situates itself well within the existing literature while advancing new insights.

4. **Clear Structure**: The paper is well-organized, making it easy for readers to follow the rationale behind the research, the proposed methods, and the experimentation. This clarity contributes to the accessibility of the findings.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity**: While the hierarchical approach is a significant improvement, introducing additional layers of policy may increase the complexity of the model and its training process. The paper could discuss the trade-offs between model complexity and the performance gains in more detail.

2. **Generality of Results**: Although the evaluation across multiple datasets is a strength, it would be beneficial to ascertain how the proposed methods scale with varying dataset sizes or diverse control tasks beyond those tested. Providing insights into the generalizability of the approach to less structured or novel environments would strengthen the applicability of the findings.

3. **Connection to Previous Work**: The related works section mentions several existing approaches that have focused on improving DT, yet further comparison or integration of these works with the proposed method could provide a clearer picture of how ADT sits within the broader context of decision-making models. More explicit discussions regarding the differences and advantages of ADT over these prior methods would be valuable.

4. **Future Directions**: The conclusion briefly mentions potential future research avenues, yet a more detailed exploration of specific hypotheses or experiments that could extend the work would be beneficial. For instance, experimenting with hybrid approaches integrating principles from other models mentioned could lead to even more effective enhancements.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Clarify the discussion around potential scalability issues of the ADT framework as the tasks become more complex.
- Strengthen the connections made to previous efforts in the field to position ADT within the wider landscape of research on transformer-based reinforcement learning.
- Elaborate on the implications of findings for real-world applications or implementations beyond the experimental benchmarks provided.

**Conclusion:**
The paper presents a well-reasoned and significant contribution to the understanding of decision-making in Reinforcement Learning through the lens of transformer architectures. The proposed ADT framework effectively addresses key limitations of existing models, providing promising results. With some further elaborations on certain aspects, this work could serve as a solid foundation for ongoing research in hierarchical decision-making processes within the RL community. Overall, this paper is poised for acceptance at ICLR 2024.
