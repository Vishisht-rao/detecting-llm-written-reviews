**Review of "THE KNN SCORE FOR EVALUATING PROBABILISTIC MULTIVARIATE TIME SERIES FORECASTING"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel evaluation metric, the k-Nearest Neighbor Score (KNNS), developed specifically for assessing probabilistic multivariate time series forecasting models. The authors argue that existing evaluation metrics, primarily derived for univariate cases, fail to adequately capture dependencies and relationships among multiple time series. Through both qualitative and quantitative analyses, the authors aim to demonstrate the advantages of the KNNS metric over current benchmarks such as Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), Mean Scaled Interval Score (MSIS), Energy Score, and Variogram Score.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Approach:** The introduction of the KNNS as an evaluation metric is a significant contribution, particularly given the limitations of existing metrics in capturing correlations and temporal dependencies in multivariate forecasting contexts.
2. **Comprehensive Review:** The authors provide a thorough analysis of existing evaluation metrics, clearly outlining their limitations, which sets a strong foundation for the need for the proposed KNNS.
3. **Methodological Rigor:** The paper includes a detailed explanation of the proposed scoring mechanism, including the use of density estimations and random projections to address the challenges associated with high-dimensional forecasting spaces.
4. **Extensive Experiments:** The authors conduct a wide range of experiments on synthetic data as well as real-world datasets, effectively demonstrating the performance and discriminative ability of the KNNS compared to other established metrics.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity of Parameters:** The paper highlights the importance of selecting parameters such as k and d, but it lacks a robust framework or guidelines for practitioners who may wish to apply the KNNS in practice. Further exploration into optimal parameter selection would strengthen the discussion.
2. **Computational Cost:** Although the paper addresses the computational efficiency of the KNNS metric, it could benefit from clearer illustrations of the computational overhead relative to existing metrics. A more explicit comparison could provide readers with insights into practical implementation in large-scale scenarios.
3. **Limited Real-World Applications:** While the authors assess the KNNS using real-world data, the extent and diversity of datasets could be broadened. An exploration of different domains (e.g., finance, healthcare) could bolster confidence in the applicability of the KNNS metric across various fields.

**Overall Impression:**
This paper represents a meaningful contribution to the field of time series forecasting, identifying a critical gap in the evaluation of probabilistic models and responding with a well-justified proposal for the KNNS metric. Despite its minor weaknesses, the clarity of the methodology, the extensive evaluation, and the clear articulation of the need for improved metrics positions this work as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the domain of time series analysis. I recommend acceptance of this paper with the incorporation of suggestions for improved parameter selection guidelines and a discussion on computational costs. 

**Recommendation: Accept with Minor Revisions**
