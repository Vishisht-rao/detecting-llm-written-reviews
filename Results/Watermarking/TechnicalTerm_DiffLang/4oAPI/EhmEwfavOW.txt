### Review of "HOLONETS: SPECTRAL CONVOLUTIONS DO EXTEND TO DIRECTED GRAPHS"

#### Summary
The paper presents a novel approach to extending spectral convolutional networks from undirected to directed graphs, under the framework called "HoloNets". Traditional spectral methods hinge on the graph Fourier transform, which is well-defined only for undirected graphs. The authors challenge this assumption and propose a mechanism to apply spectral convolutions using holomorphic functional calculus, allowing them to work on directed graphs without default reliance on self-adjoint operators. The paper provides theoretical foundations, empirical validations, and introduces two specific architectures within this framework: FaberNet and Dir-ResolvNet.

#### Strengths
1. **Innovative Approach**: The proposal to utilize holomorphic functions to define spectral filters on directed graphs is a significant advancement. This provides new paths for research and applications in graph neural networks (GNNs), especially in contexts where edge directionality plays a critical role.
   
2. **Theoretical Foundation**: The authors offer a comprehensive mathematical framework that underpins their proposed model. The paper details the use of complex analysis and spectral theory effectively, making it understandable, even for readers less familiar with these fields.

3. **Empirical Validation**: The paper presents extensive experiments on various real-world datasets, demonstrating that HoloNets achieve state-of-the-art results for heterophilic node classification tasks. The experiments are well-structured, comparing the performance of HoloNets against a diverse set of baseline models.

4. **Practical Implications**: The proposed models, particularly Dir-ResolvNet, show robustness to resolution-scale variations in input, which is crucial in applications like molecular property prediction where noise and variations in data can significantly impact performance.

5. **Reproducibility**: The authors emphasize the importance of reproducibility, providing clear details on their experimental setups and code availability, which fosters community engagement and further research.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Complexity of Implementation**: While the theoretical framework is solid, the complexity of the methodology, especially with the use of holomorphic functional calculus, may pose challenges in practical implementations for practitioners who might not have a strong mathematical background.

2. **Limited Application Scenarios**: Although the paper shows strong results in heterophilic classification and molecular property prediction, it is unclear how well the proposed methods perform in other types of graph-structured data that may not adhere to the characteristics exhibited in the datasets used.

3. **Comparison with Advanced Baselines**: While the experiments report significant improvements over existing models, a more rigorous comparative analysis against newer architectures, such as those leveraging attention mechanisms or transformer-based frameworks for graphs, could strengthen the claims of superiority further.

4. **Scalability Considerations**: The paper does not adequately discuss the scalability of the proposed methods for very large graphs, a common concern in the application of GNNs in real-world scenarios.

5. **Further Exploration of Complexity Trade-offs**: The paper mentions that complex weights can enhance performance but does not propose straightforward methods for selecting between complex and real parameters, which could be a point of contention in practical applications.

#### Recommendations
- **Expand Experimental Evaluation**: To further substantiate generalizability, additional experiments on varied graph structures and real-world applications (such as social networks or transport networks) would be beneficial.
- **Clarify Complexity in Implementation**: Consider providing a simplified overview or a tutorial-like section that distills the key aspects of the proposed methods for practitioners.
- **Address Scalability**: Incorporate discussions or experiments concerning the scalability of HoloNets when applied to very large graphs, potentially using sub-sampling or other approaches to illustrate efficacy in these scenarios.
- **Dynamic Hyperparameter Selection**: Including insights or methodologies for optimizing hyperparameters (like between real and complex weights) dynamically during training could enhance the model's usability.

#### Conclusion
Overall, "HOLONETS: SPECTRAL CONVOLUTIONS DO EXTEND TO DIRECTED GRAPHS" makes a compelling contribution to the graph neural network literature, offering a fresh perspective on spectral methods in directed settings. The paper's theoretical rigor, combined with empirical evidence, suggests substantial potential for application in a variety of domains, although further work is needed to address the mentioned weaknesses and enhance practical applicability.
