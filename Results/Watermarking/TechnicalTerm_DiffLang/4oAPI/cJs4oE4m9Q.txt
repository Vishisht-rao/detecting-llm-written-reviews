**Review of "Deep Orthogonal Hypersphere Compression for Anomaly Detection"**

**Summary**

The paper introduces two novel deep learning models, Deep Orthogonal Hypersphere Contraction (DOHSC) and Deep Orthogonal Bi-Hypersphere Compression (DO2HSC), aimed at improving anomaly detection performances across various data types, particularly in high-dimensional spaces. The authors posit that traditional hypersphere-based anomaly detection techniques can lead to suboptimal decision boundaries (such as hyperellipsoids) due to inherent high-dimensional issues (like the soap-bubble phenomenon) and sparsity in data distributions. The proposed models utilize orthogonal projection layers to enhance the learning of hyperspherical representations and extend anomaly detection to graph-level data. 

**Strengths**

1. **Innovative Approach**: The introduction of orthogonal projection within the realm of anomaly detection is a notable innovation. The two proposed models present a compelling argument for the efficacy of creating compact decision boundaries in high-dimensional spaces.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The experimental section offers a thorough evaluation on various datasets, demonstrating the models' effectiveness using metrics like AUC and F1-scores. The inclusion of diverse data types (image, tabular, graph) supports the versatility of the proposed approaches.

3. **Theoretical Justification**: The authors provide theoretical insights into the limitations of traditional hypersphere-based models, supported by well-articulated propositions. This theoretical groundwork enhances the foundation on which DOHSC and DO2HSC are built.

4. **Robustness and Stability**: Empirical results suggest that both DOHSC and DO2HSC outperform state-of-the-art techniques across multiple tasks, indicating robust performance. The supplementary results related to the models' stability against varying parameters are also insightful.

5. **Extensive Experiments**: The attention to detail concerning the experimental setup, including ablation studies to assess the importance of various components, further solidifies the outcomes reported.

**Weaknesses**

1. **Clarity and Organization**: While the manuscript is rich in technical details, it could benefit from improved organization. Some sections, particularly those delineating method descriptions and experimental results, are lengthy and might overwhelm readers. A clearer structure with more subsections or bullet points could enhance readability.

2. **Limitations and Future Work**: The discussion on limitations is somewhat lacking. While the authors acknowledge some constraints concerning the model's assumption of single-class normal data, a deeper exploration or suggestion of future work to address multi-class anomalies would strengthen this section.

3. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**: The sensitivity analysis presented includes various settings, yet the rationale behind choosing specific percentiles or hyperparameters for DO2HSC could be elaborated further. A deeper exploration into how these choices affect model performance would be beneficial for practitioners.

4. **Implementation Details**: While the authors provide machine learning and deep learning insights, missing are more specific implementation details that would allow for easier replication of their models. Information regarding the code and libraries used, as well as computational resources, should be included.

5. **Visual Results**: While some visualization results are provided, the impact of visual aids in conveying complex ideas could be enhanced further. Additional diagrams, especially comparing distributions before and after applying the proposed methods, would add valuable context for readers.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the paper "Deep Orthogonal Hypersphere Compression for Anomaly Detection" presents novel contributions to anomaly detection, addressing significant limitations in existing methodologies. It offers comprehensive evaluations and theoretical backing, thus making a valuable addition to the literature. However, improvements in clarity, parameter discussions, and transparency regarding the implementation details would enhance the overall presentation. Overall, this paper has the potential to impact the anomaly detection domain positively, and I recommend it for acceptance with minor revisions.
