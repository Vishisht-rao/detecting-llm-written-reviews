**Review of "MOREDROP: DROPOUT WITHOUT DROPPING"**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces a novel approach for addressing distributional shift in deep neural networks during training and evaluation phases, specifically focusing on the dropout mechanism. The proposed method, Model Regularization for Dropout (MoReDrop), emphasizes using the dense model's loss as the primary objective while implementing a regularization term derived from the dense-sub model relationship. The authors claim that their method not only mitigates distributional shifts but also maintains computational efficiency and robustness against higher dropout rates. A lightweight variant, MoReDropL, is proposed to further reduce computational load by applying dropout only at the last layer.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Contribution:** The introduction of MoReDrop as a dense-to-sub regularization method is innovative. It effectively repurposes traditional dropout techniques to mitigate distributional shifts without explicitly dropping neurons during training, thus proposing a fresh perspective on model training with dropout.

2. **Theoretical Justification and Experimental Validation:** The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation for its claims, including a clear presentation of the underlying regularization mechanics. The experiments conducted across multiple datasets and tasks effectively demonstrate the superiority of MoReDrop compared to existing dropout methods, including R-Drop and standard models.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The experiments cover a wide range of tasks in both image classification and natural language understanding, showcasing MoReDrop's effectiveness across multiple domains. The robustness of MoReDrop against varying dropout rates is particularly noteworthy.

4. **Scalability and Efficiency:** The proposal of MoReDropL is valuable, especially in scenarios where computational resources are a concern. The focus on performance with reduced computational costs makes it a practical framework for various applications.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Lack of Comparative Baselines:** While the authors compare their approach to state-of-the-art dropout techniques, there seems to be a lack of comparisons with other regularization methods and techniques outside of dropout-based approaches. Including more baselines could provide a clearer picture of where MoReDrop stands in the broader landscape of neural network regularization techniques.

2. **Computational Complexity Analysis:** While the authors mention the computational efficiency of MoReDropL, the paper lacks detailed analysis comparing the computational costs associated with MoReDrop and its variants against existing methods. A more thorough examination could help in validating its purported efficiency gains.

3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Discussion:** Although the paper assesses the sensitivity of the proposed methods to hyperparameters, it might benefit from a more robust investigation into the impact of hyperparameters on performance. The relationship between dropout rates and model generalization ability could be discussed in greater detail, possibly with visualizations to support the analysis.

4. **Discussion of Limitations and Future Work:** The authors briefly mention potential limitations, but a deeper exploration of their findings regarding specific tasks or models where MoReDrop might struggle would enrich the discussion. Future work should also address how these methods could be extended to more complex models and tasks, such as self-supervised learning.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, "MOREDROP: DROPOUT WITHOUT DROPPING" presents a compelling approach to enhancing dropout's efficacy in neural networks by addressing the distributional shift problem. While the contributions are significant and supported by solid experimental results, incorporating more comparisons to other methods, a detailed computational analysis, and further discussions on limitations would strengthen the paper. I recommend it for acceptance, provided that the aforementioned weaknesses are addressed where possible.
