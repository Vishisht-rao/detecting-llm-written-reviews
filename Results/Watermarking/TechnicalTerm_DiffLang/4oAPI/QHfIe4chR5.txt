**Reviewer Report on "Long-Distance Targeted Poisoning Attacks on Graph Neural Networks"**

**Summary**:
The paper proposes a novel approach to targeted poisoning attacks on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that allows attackers to manipulate node classifications by introducing malicious nodes outside the target node's k-hop neighborhood. The authors present two methods: MetaLDT, a principled bilevel optimization approach, and MimicLDT, a heuristic approximation that is efficient for larger graphs. The experimental results indicate that these long-distance attacks can achieve substantial poisoning success rates while evading existing defense mechanisms.

**Strengths**:

1. **Novelty**: The work introduces the concept of long-distance poisoning attacks, significantly expanding the scope of current research that primarily focuses on short-distance attacks that modify the target's neighborhood. This shift addresses a critical gap in the literature.

2. **Methodology**: The development of MetaLDT based on bilevel optimization and its subsequent heuristic approximation in MimicLDT are well-conceived. The decision to constrain the attack space to avoid detection is insightful and is a positive contribution to the field.

3. **Experiments**: Comprehensive experiments are conducted, using multiple GNN architectures and datasets. The authors convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of their attack methods against both vanilla and robust GNN models, which adds robustness to their claims.

4. **Stealthiness**: The study adequately addresses the stealthiness of the attacks, showing minimal modifications to the degree distribution and homophily within the poisoned graphs. This aspect is crucial for practical applications of the attack.

5. **End-to-End Attack**: The extension to generate textual features for fake nodes presents an innovative application of contemporary language models, showcasing the potential real-world implications of the proposed attacks.

**Weaknesses**:

1. **Scalability of MetaLDT**: While the authors acknowledge the limitations of MetaLDT in terms of computational resources and scalability to large graphs, further discussion on potential ways to optimize or parallelize the method would enhance the paper. Recommendations or direction for future work on this issue could be beneficial.

2. **Heuristic Trade-offs**: Although MimicLDT offers a more scalable alternative with decent success rates, the authors could benefit from a more detailed exploration of the trade-offs involved in using heuristics, especially regarding precision and feature similarity. A deeper analysis could inform the community about the limitations of relying on heuristic methods.

3. **Defense Mechanisms**: While the effectiveness of the attacks against current defenses is presented, the paper does not explore countermeasures in detail. A discussion on potential defenses that could mitigate long-distance poisoning attacks would be valuable for practitioners in the field.

4. **Metric Clarity**: Although the paper references various metrics (e.g., homophily and degree distribution), clearer definitions and justifications for these metrics would strengthen the results' interpretability. Additionally, providing a detailed computation breakdown might be useful for other researchers looking to replicate the study.

**Conclusion**:
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the body of knowledge surrounding GNN vulnerabilities and poses a compelling case for the feasibility of long-distance targeted poisoning attacks. While the proposed methods are promising and well-evaluated, addressing the noted weaknesses will further augment the paperâ€™s impact. I recommend it for acceptance, with minor revisions focused on clarifying scalability issues, heuristic trade-offs, and potential defenses.
