**Review of "A Local Graph Limits Perspective on Sampling-Based GNNs"**

### Summary

This paper introduces a theoretical framework for training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on large input graphs by utilizing small, fixed-size sampled subgraphs. The authors aim to bridge the gap between the practical successes of sampling-based GNNs and the lack of formal models that explain their efficiency. By leveraging the theory of graph local limits, the authors prove that under certain mild assumptions, the parameters learned through training on small samples are close to those obtained by training on the entire graph. They empirically validate their findings with experiments on citation graphs, demonstrating that smaller sampled subgraphs provide comparable performance to full graph training.

### Strengths 

1. **Theoretical Contribution**: The paper establishes a sound theoretical foundation for sampling-based GNNs. By applying the theory of graph limits, the authors derive important convergence results (Theorems 5.4 and 5.7), which enhance our understanding of how smaller subgraphs can effectively represent and approximate the training of GNNs on larger graphs.

2. **Practical Implications**: The framework provides guidelines for practitioners regarding when and how to sample while training GNNs on large graphs. This can significantly reduce computational costs and speed up the model selection process.

3. **Extensive Empirical Validation**: The authors provide empirical evidence through well-structured experiments conducted on various datasets, including PubMed and ogbn-mag. These experiments demonstrate that training with significantly smaller graphs does not compromise the performance of GNNs, thus supporting their theoretical claims.

4. **Comprehensive Literature Review**: The paper effectively situates its contributions within the existing literature, acknowledging previous works while clarifying how this work extends known results regarding GNN convergence and sampling techniques.

### Weaknesses

1. **Assumption Constraints**: While the authors provide a set of assumptions that are flexible, the paper would benefit from a more explicit discussion of the implications if these assumptions do not hold in certain real-world cases. A thorough analysis of edge cases or situations where convergence might fail could strengthen the work.

2. **Analysis of Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: While the results are promising, the sensitivity of the proposed method to hyperparameters such as the size of the sampled subgraphs or sampling intervals is not thoroughly explored. An investigation into how these parameters affect performance and stability would be valuable.

3. **Comparisons with Other Techniques**: The paper primarily focuses on comparing learned parameters from sampled subgraphs to those learned from full graphs. However, comparisons with other existing methods (e.g., adaptive sampling techniques or recent advances in GNNs) would contextualize the effectiveness of the proposed framework better.

4. **Complexity Analysis**: Although convergence guarantees are provided, a clear computational complexity analysis detailing how the proposed approach scales with respect to graph size and sampling methods would enhance the practicality of the framework.

### Recommendations 

- **Enhanced Discussion on Assumptions**: Expand on potential scenarios where the assumptions may fail or does not hold true. Clarifying limitations would provide a more robust understanding of the applicability of the framework.

- **Hyperparameter Testing**: Include additional experiments that systematically vary hyperparameters to gauge their effect on the performance of the method and identify robust setting ranges.

- **Broader Comparative Studies**: Include comparative analysis with recent adaptive sampling methods or other GNN techniques to position the proposed framework within the broader landscape of GNN research.

### Conclusion

Overall, this paper is well-written and presents a meaningful contribution to the field of GNNs by presenting a theoretical framework that addresses some of the pressing challenges associated with scaling GNNs on large graphs. The findings are timely and relevant to graph-based machine learning, promising a balance between theory and practical application. With minor revisions and deeper analyses, the paper may serve as a seminal piece guiding future work in sampling-based GNNs. I recommend accepting this paper after these improvements are made.
