**Review of "Predictive Coding Beyond Correlations"**

**Summary:**
The paper "Predictive Coding Beyond Correlations" explores the application of predictive coding (PC) in modeling both causal inference and causal discovery. The authors propose a framework that extends the predictive coding paradigm to go beyond conditional probabilities to effectively perform interventional and counterfactual inference. This is achieved through modifications to the standard Bayesian inference process. The paper claims to demonstrate that the proposed PC-based causal models can learn structures from observational data and answer causal queries efficiently, with empirical evaluations showcasing the method's applicability to various machine learning tasks.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Integration of Fields:** The authors adeptly bridge the fields of computational neuroscience and causal inference, presenting predictive coding as a versatile tool for addressing tasks traditionally dominated by causal discovery techniques.
  
2. **Methodological Advancement:** The proposal to enable causal inference using predictive coding models represents a significant advance. The ability to perform counterfactual reasoning without the need for traditional structural adjustments to the causal graph is compelling and innovative.

3. **Empirical Validation:** The extensive empirical evaluation across a range of benchmarks provides robustness to the theoretical claims made. This could help in illustrating the practical applicability of the proposed method in real-world scenarios.

4. **Comprehensive Treatment of Causal Models:** The paper effectively covers the necessary theoretical background to understand the progression from Bayesian inference to causal inference, thereby making the topic more accessible.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity and Clarity:** While the approach is theoretically rich, there are instances where the explanations could be clearer. Certain definitions and explanations, particularly those surrounding variational free energy and the specifics of the predictive coding model, may benefit from more straightforward language or additional illustrations.

2. **Limited Discussion on Assumptions:** The paper implies causal sufficiency, yet it does not adequately address the implications of this assumption on the results. The findings may be sensitive to unobserved confounders, and a deeper discussion on the impact of these assumptions could strengthen the validity of the claims.

3. **Theoretical Foundations:** While the empirical results are promising, the theoretical foundations for generalizations beyond Markov equivalence classes could be elaborated upon. A more rigorous theoretical backing that addresses potential limitations or assumptions would reinforce the contributions of the paper.

4. **Comparative Analysis:** The paper cites several baseline methods, but a more detailed comparative analysis is warranted. Discussing the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches in juxtaposition with the proposed method would provide a clearer justification for its necessity and relevance.

**Minor Comments:**
- There are several typographical errors and formatting inconsistencies that detract from the overall readability of the text. Careful proofreading is encouraged.
  
- Figures that depict data and findings, such as those in Section 4, could be labeled more clearly to ensure that their significance is easily grasped by readers.

- The inclusion of discussions on limitations of the proposed method, particularly in terms of scalability and applicability to highly complex structures, would present a more balanced view.

**Conclusion:**
"Predictive Coding Beyond Correlations" presents a noteworthy contribution to the fields of computational neuroscience and causal inference. The paper's innovative approach to utilizing predictive coding for causal reasoning has the potential to inspire novel methodologies in machine learning. However, addressing the clarity of presentation, the explication of assumptions, and expanding on theoretical foundations will enhance the overall impact and accessibility of the work. I recommend acceptance of the paper, provided that the authors take care to address the identified issues during the revision process.
