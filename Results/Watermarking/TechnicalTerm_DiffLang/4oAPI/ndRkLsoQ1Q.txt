**Review of "Unleashing the Potential of Regularization Strategies in Learning with Noisy Labels"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a method, Regularized Cross-Entropy (RegCE), which explores the efficacy of traditional regularization techniques—namely sharp learning rate decay, data augmentations, and model weight averaging—in improving the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on datasets with noisy labels. The authors argue that these conventional strategies, when adequately employed, can outperform existing complex algorithms designed specifically for noisy label scenarios.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Perspective:** The approach emphasizes a re-evaluation of the effectiveness of standard regularization techniques within the context of noisy label learning. This perspective is refreshing, particularly in a field that has become heavily focused on complex models and methods.

2. **Extensive Empirical Validation:** The authors provide substantial empirical evidence demonstrating the performance of RegCE across various datasets—including both synthetic and real-world examples. Such thorough testing lends credibility to their claims and offers a comprehensive view of the model's robustness to label noise.

3. **Clear Methodological Framework:** The paper presents a clear breakdown of the components of RegCE, alongside detailed discussions of how each regularization strategy contributes to improved performance. The introduction of semi-supervised learning techniques further enhances the potential applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.

4. **Effective Communication:** The manuscript is well-organized and presents the results in a manner that is accessible to readers, with adequate mathematical and theoretical discussion supporting the empirical findings.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Comparative Analysis:** While the authors compare RegCE with various state-of-the-art methods, there is room for more in-depth analysis. Highlighting the specific advantages and disadvantages of competing methods might provide greater context regarding where RegCE excels or falls short.

2. **Limited Theoretical Basis:** The paper could benefit from a stronger theoretical foundation linking the proposed methods to existing literature. Although empirical results are compelling, a more rigorous theoretical analysis could bolster their argument about the importance of regularization techniques.

3. **Generalization to Other Domains:** The current focus is primarily on the CIFAR datasets and a few real-world datasets. It remains unclear how well RegCE would perform on other types of tasks, such as those involving different modalities or more complex label noise structures. Addressing the generalization capabilities of RegCE would add significant value.

4. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The ablation studies highlight hyperparameter choices impacting model performance, but more detailed exploration of hyperparameter optimization techniques could enhance reproducibility and understanding of the method's robustness.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, "Unleashing the Potential of Regularization Strategies in Learning with Noisy Labels" provides valuable insights and a practical framework for addressing the challenges of learning with noisy labels. While the proposed Regularized Cross-Entropy method shows promising results, further theoretical analysis and expanded experimental validation across diverse tasks would enhance the paper's contributions. In conclusion, this paper is a noteworthy addition to the literature and encourages a reconsideration of conventional training methods in complex learning environments. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
