**Review of "Learning High-Order Relationships of Brain Regions"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel approach, named H YBRID, for identifying high-order relationships among brain regions using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The authors argue that existing methods predominantly focus on pairwise connections and propose that a deeper understanding can be achieved by considering higher-order relationships that are maximally informative and minimally redundant (MIMR). H YBRID utilizes a deep learning framework that consists of a CONSTRUCTOR to identify hyperedge structures and a WEIGHTER to compute weights for these structures, aiming to improve cognitive outcome predictions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, showing a notable average improvement of 12.1% over state-of-the-art models.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty and Relevance:** The paper addresses an important gap in the neuroscientific analysis of fMRI data by focusing on higher-order interactions rather than just pairwise relationships. This focus is timely and has the potential to provide richer insights into cognitive processes.

2. **Methodological Innovation:** The proposed architecture, especially its unique CONSTRUCTOR and multi-head drop-bottleneck optimization framework, is innovative. This approach efficiently learns hyperedges in a data-driven manner while ensuring computational efficiency and theoretical guarantees regarding informativeness and redundancy.

3. **Empirical Validation:** The authors provide a thorough empirical analysis across eight datasets, demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of their approach in predicting cognitive outcomes. The paper includes appropriate comparisons with a range of baseline models, highlighting H YBRID's superior performance.

4. **Theoretical Insights:** The derivation of the optimization objective based on an information bottleneck framework adds theoretical depth to the work, allowing for better understanding and potential applications in related fields.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity and Interpretability:** While the proposed method is sophisticated, certain aspects of the model—such as the multi-head and masking mechanisms—could benefit from clearer explanations. For instance, the interpretability of the identified hyperedges and how they relate to specific cognitive functions is not deeply explored. Greater emphasis on interpretation could provide valuable insights for neuroscientific applications.

2. **Limitations Acknowledged:** The authors briefly mention that their model only considers static high-order relationships. This limitation could be more prominently discussed, especially considering the dynamic nature of cognitive processes. Future work could explore how to incorporate temporal changes in brain connectivity.

3. **Data and Generalizability:** Although eight datasets are analyzed, the diversity of the samples and conditions may still pose questions about the generalizability of results. The authors could strengthen their argument by discussing how their findings may transfer to other populations or types of cognitive tasks.

4. **Detailed Ablation Studies:** While ablation studies are included, a more extensive analysis could be useful. For instance, evaluating how varying the architecture or the hyperparameters affect the results in detail would provide insights into the robustness and flexibility of the proposed model.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper represents a substantial contribution to the field of neuroscience and brain connectivity research. By effectively combining deep learning techniques with a focus on high-order relationships, H YBRID demonstrates strong potential for improving predictions related to cognitive outcomes. Addressing the highlighted weaknesses could further enhance its impact and applicability. I recommend an acceptance with minor revisions, particularly focusing on clarifying model details, expanding on theoretical insights, and discussing implications for future research.
