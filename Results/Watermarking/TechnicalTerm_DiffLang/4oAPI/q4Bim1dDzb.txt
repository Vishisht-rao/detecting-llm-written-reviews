**Review of "UniVoxel: Fast Inverse Rendering by Unified Voxelization of Scene Representation"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel framework named UniVoxel for inverse rendering, focusing on efficient scene representation through unified voxelization of geometry, materials, and illumination. The authors argue that traditional inverse rendering methods, often relying on implicit representations, suffer from inefficiencies and long training times due to the complexity of the model mappings for separate scene properties. The proposed approach encodes the scene into a volumetric representation that enables simultaneous learning of geometry, materials, and illumination with lightweight neural networks. Notably, the authors introduce Spherical Gaussians for incident light representation, allowing for efficient integration of illumination modeling.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty**: The UniVoxel framework provides a fresh perspective on inverse rendering by focusing on explicit representations rather than traditional implicit methods. This shift is well-justified and addresses critical limitations of prior work in terms of optimization efficiency.

2. **Performance**: The experiments demonstrate significant improvements in optimization speed, reducing training time per scene from several hours to 18 minutes while achieving competitive reconstruction quality. Such findings strongly support the authors' claims.

3. **Thorough Evaluation**: The authors conduct extensive experiments across multiple datasets, including synthetic and real-world scenarios, which effectively showcase the robustness and versatility of the proposed method. The comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches offers a comprehensive view of the advantages of UniVoxel.

4. **Technical Depth**: The paper thoroughly explains the architecture and functioning of the proposed framework, covering all critical components including voxelization, rendering, and illumination modeling.

5. **Loss Functions**: The careful design of loss functions and regularization techniques provides insight into how to mitigate challenges like material-lighting ambiguity, which is a notable contribution to the field.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Memory Consumption**: The paper briefly mentions that UniVoxel requires a large amount of memory for storing scene properties, similar to other explicit methods. However, it lacks a detailed discussion of memory requirements and possible strategies for optimization or management, which could significantly enhance practicality.

2. **Illustration Clarity**: While the figures effectively represent the differences between UniVoxel and other methods, certain illustrations could benefit from clearer legends or annotations to enhance reader comprehension. 

3. **Limited Discussion on Scalability**: The paper does not discuss the scalability of the method concerning larger or more complex scenes. Addressing this concern would help contextualize the practicality of UniVoxel in real-world applications.

4. **Comparative Depth**: Although comparisons with state-of-the-art methods are good, a deeper analysis addressing the mathematical or algorithmic differences in existing approaches, especially those that also present improvements in efficiency, would strengthen the work’s impact.

**Recommendation:**
The submission offers a significant advancement in the field of inverse rendering through a unified representation approach. It is recommended that the authors address the weaknesses noted, particularly concerning memory utilization and scalability, in a future revision. Overall, the paper is well-structured, and the results are compelling, making it suitable for presentation at ICLR 2024.

**Rating: 8/10** (with potential for improvement post-revisions)
