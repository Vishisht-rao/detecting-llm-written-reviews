**Review of PTARL: Prototype-based Tabular Representation Learning via Space Calibration**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel framework called PTARL (Prototype-based Tabular Representation Learning), aimed at addressing the limitations of existing deep learning methods for tabular data, particularly issues related to representation entanglement and localization. The authors propose a two-stage method consisting of prototype generation and representation projection into a prototype-based projection space (P-Space). They introduce two constraints—Coordinates Diversifying and Global Prototype Matrix Orthogonalization—to enable disentangled representations that improve prediction accuracy. The framework is evaluated on a variety of tabular datasets and its performance is compared to several state-of-the-art deep tabular models.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Approach:** PTARL offers a fresh perspective on tabular data by incorporating prototype learning, which has shown promise in other areas of machine learning. This approach addresses specific challenges that deep learning models face when applied to tabular data, paving the way for future research.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The authors conducted extensive experiments on multiple datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of PTARL. The results consistently show improvements across various baseline deep tabular models, which supports the claims made regarding the framework's advantages.

3. **Methodological Rigor:** The paper provides a clear description of the methods used—specifically, the use of KMeans for prototype initialization and Optimal Transport for measuring distances between distributions. These choices are well-justified and reflect a solid understanding of the underlying concepts.

4. **Ablation Studies:** The inclusion of ablation studies to evaluate the importance of different components of the PTARL framework adds credibility to the proposed framework and helps isolate the effects of each part.

5. **Visualization of Results:** The use of visualizations to demonstrate the representation entanglement and the effects of PTARL on learning disentangled representations is an effective way to communicate the benefits of the proposed method.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Discussion of Related Work:** While the paper mentions several previous works in deep tabular learning and prototype-based methods, a more in-depth comparison with current literature would strengthen the foundation for the proposed method. Specifically, discussing how PTARL improves upon existing models in detail could enhance the reader's understanding.

2. **Algorithm Complexity:** While the authors state that the implementation of Optimal Transport does not significantly increase computational complexity, more detailed analysis on the runtime and scalability of the proposed method, especially concerning larger datasets, would be beneficial.

3. **Potential Overfitting:** The paper highlights significant performance gains, but there are no reports on whether the improvements generalize well to unseen data. A discussion on potential overfitting issues and how the proposed constraints might mitigate such risks could provide deeper insights into the robustness of the model.

4. **Interpretability of Results:** Although the authors provide visualizations, the interpretability of global prototypes and how they correspond to specific features or classes could be further elaborated to help practitioners understand their significance in practical applications.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of tabular data modeling with deep learning. PTARL addresses critical shortcomings of existing methods and demonstrates improved predictive performance through innovative use of prototype learning. The methodological rigor combined with extensive experimental validation enhances the paper's stance in the academic community. However, it could benefit from deeper explorations into related work, algorithm complexity, potential overfitting, and interpretability of findings. Accepted with minor revisions for clarity and to address the outlined weaknesses.
