**Review of "FastImitation via Behavior Foundation Models"**

**Overview:**
The paper presents a novel approach to imitation learning (IL) using Behavior Foundation Models (BFMs) based on successor measures. The authors address the limitations of existing methods that often require numerous expert demonstrations and extensive reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for each new task. The proposed FB-IL framework leverages pre-trained models to significantly reduce the time and computational resources needed to produce imitation policies. 

**Clarity and Structure:**
The paper is generally well-structured, with a clear introduction that outlines the problem, the motivation behind the research, and a summary of key contributions. The methodology section effectively describes the properties desired in the BFMs and explains how they meet these properties. The inclusion of detailed experimental results enhances the clarity of the claims made by the authors. 

The figures and tables used throughout the paper are helpful in illustrating the performance of the proposed methods compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. However, some sections could benefit from more descriptive subheadings or bullet points to aid skimming.

**Technical Merit:**
The main technical contribution of the paper is the FB-IL framework, which demonstrates strong performance across multiple environments in comparison to traditional IL methods. The use of successor measures is a sophisticated approach that allows the model to adapt to different types of imitation tasks without additional fine-tuning. The experiments show that FB-IL methods can produce imitation policies in seconds, which is a significant improvement over existing offline IL algorithms that often require hours of computation.

However, while the theoretical groundwork is presented, there are areas where deeper analysis or discussion could enhance the paper. For instance, further elaboration on how the choice of hyperparameters affects the performance of the BFMs, particularly in non-stationary environments, would be advantageous.

**Experimental Validation:**
The authors conduct extensive experiments using a variety of domains from the DeepMind Control Suite, demonstrating the versatility and effectiveness of FB-IL against several baselines. The results are promising, showing that FB-IL methods perform comparably or better than SOTA offline IL algorithms with significantly reduced computation times. Furthermore, the exploration of the number of demonstrations required and generalization across different initial distributions provides valuable insights into the robustness of the proposed methods.

One suggestion for improvement would be to include ablation studies to isolate the effects of different components within the BFM and to provide a clearer picture of which aspects are most critical to the success of the imitation learning process.

**Novelty:**
The work introduces the concept of BFMs for IL and demonstrates their effectiveness in a novel manner. The integration of multiple IL paradigms (behavioral cloning, feature matching, and goal-based methods) under a unified framework is noteworthy and highlights the adaptability of the proposed methods. This approach represents a significant step forward in the field of imitation learning.

**Potential Issues:**
While the paper is generally strong, one limitation is the reliance on the quality of the pre-trained foundation models. The authors acknowledge that issues with representation collapse could arise, particularly when using suboptimal training data. A more in-depth discussion of strategies to mitigate these concerns, such as fine-tuning or improving the training datasets, would strengthen the paper.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, "FastImitation via Behavior Foundation Models" offers a compelling contribution to the field of imitation learning, combining theoretical insights with practical results. The framework shows promise for reducing computational demands while maintaining or improving performance on imitation tasks. Addressing the suggested areas for improvement could further enhance the impact and clarity of this work. 

**Rating: 8/10** (Strong paper with significant contributions but could use minor improvements in clarity and depth of analysis.)
