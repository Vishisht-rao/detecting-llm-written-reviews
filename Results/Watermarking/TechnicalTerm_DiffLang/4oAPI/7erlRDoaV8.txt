### Review of "Can Sensitive Information Be Deleted from LLMs? Objectives for Defending Against Extraction Attacks"

#### Summary
The paper presents a comprehensive investigation of the challenges associated with removing sensitive information from large language models (LLMs) and proposes an attack-and-defense framework to tackle these issues. The authors focus on direct edits to model weights and analyze the effectiveness of existing techniques, such as ROME, in deleting sensitive information. Through a series of controlled experiments, they reveal that even advanced editing methods struggle to completely erase factual knowledge, resulting in notable vulnerabilities to both whitebox and blackbox extraction attacks. The paper contributes new objectives for defending against these attacks, revealing that no single defense method is universally effective.

#### Strengths
1. **Relevance of Topic**: The paper addresses a pressing concern in the deployment of LLMs: the risks posed by the unintended memorization of sensitive data. The findings have significant implications for privacy protection and ethical AI practices.

2. **Comprehensive Framework**: By establishing a clear attack-and-defense framework, the authors effectively set the stage for their experiments and analyses. The threat model introduced is both intuitive and relevant for assessing the security of LLMs.

3. **Rigorous Experimental Design**: The authors conducted well-structured experiments on various models (GPT-J, Llama-2, and GPT2-XL) across different datasets to assess the success of extraction attacks and evaluate the proposed defense mechanisms. The use of multiple metrics for assessing attack success and model knowledge damage is commendable.

4. **Novel Insights**: The paper uncovers significant weaknesses in current model editing techniques and presents new defense methods that show promise against certain attacks. The insight that deleted information may still be present in intermediate model representations is particularly valuable.

5. **Clear Writing and Structure**: The paper is well-organized, clearly stating the problem, methodology, results, and conclusions. The figures and tables elucidate key points convincingly and help reinforce the findings.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Generalizability of Results**: While the analysis is thorough with respect to the studied models, it is not clear how generalizable these findings are to future models or other architectures. The authors should discuss the scalability of their defense strategies and whether they would be effective across a range of model sizes and configurations.

2. **Limited Universality of Defenses**: The authors admit that they could not find a single defense mechanism effective against all types of attacks. While this is an honest assessment, it may leave readers concerned about the practical application of their findings. Further exploration of a combined defense strategy or a more generalized approach might be beneficial.

3. **Ethical Considerations**: The ethics section touches on the implications of their findings, but it could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the potential societal implications of deploying LLMs with residual sensitive information and the legal ramifications of such scenarios.

4. **Potential for Misuse**: The authors should acknowledge and discuss how the knowledge gained from their research could potentially be misapplied, either in the development of malicious extraction techniques or in circumventing current defenses. This consideration is important for responsible AI research.

#### Conclusion
This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of AI safety and model privacy. It rigorously analyzes the effectiveness of current techniques for erasing sensitive information from LLMs and proposes improvements to defense methodologies. While the findings are valuable and timely, a discussion about the generalizability of results, a more substantive exploration of combined defense strategies, and a deeper examination of ethical implications would enhance the paper. Overall, this work is recommended for acceptance, as it provides critical insights into an area of vital importance in the era of large-scale language models.
