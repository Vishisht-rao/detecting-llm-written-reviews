**Review of "DISCO-BENCH: A Context-Aware Evaluation Benchmark for Language Modelling"**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces Disco-Bench, a novel evaluation benchmark designed to assess the performance of language models in capturing intra-sentence contextual properties across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The authors argue that existing benchmarks predominantly focus on inter-sentence properties, neglecting the critical aspects of discourse that cross sentence boundaries. Disco-Bench comprises three main components: a context-aware benchmark with nine datasets related to understanding, translation, and generation, a diagnostic dataset to probe models' discourse knowledge, and a large-scale training corpus tailored for fine-grained pretraining. The extensive experiments conducted reveal significant insights into the challenges facing models in discourse modeling and highlight the benefits of fine-tuned pretraining on discourse data.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Contribution:** The development of Disco-Bench fills a critical gap in NLP evaluation frameworks by focusing on intra-sentence properties and discourse phenomena, an area that has been underexplored. This is an important contribution to the field.
  
2. **Comprehensive Dataset Design:** The authors provide a well-structured dataset featuring diverse sources of rich linguistic phenomena in both English and Chinese. The variety of tasks across different NLP domains enhances the benchmark's applicability.

3. **Diagnostic Insights:** The introduction of a diagnostic test suite allows for nuanced examination of the extent to which language models understand and internalize discourse information, providing a significant avenue for further research.

4. **In-depth Experiments and Analysis:** The paper presents thorough experimental evaluations across numerous models and tasks, contributing valuable insights regarding the efficacy of fine-tuning on discourse-focused data compared to standard training practices.

5. **Public Resources:** The commitment to release the benchmark datasets and pretrained models underscores an effort to foster collaborative research in this domain. This openness is beneficial for the NLP community.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Language Scope:** While the inclusion of Chinese and English is commendable, the benchmark could benefit from incorporating additional languages to enhance generalizability and inclusivity in a multilingual context.

2. **Potential Lack of Clarity in Definitions:** The definitions of some discourse phenomena, such as cohesion and coherence, may need to be elaborated further. Some unclear terms could hinder comprehension for readers who are not well-versed in linguistic theories.

3. **Generalization of Results:** The findings are primarily based on certain existing models. It would be insightful to see how other emerging architectures and contextualized representations perform on Disco-Bench. The validation of this benchmark against diverse models outside the current study would strengthen the claims.

4. **Evaluation Metrics:** The reliance on automatic metrics such as BLEU and PPL may not sufficiently capture the richness of discourse phenomena. While human evaluation was conducted, a more detailed comparison discussing the limitations of these metrics in a discourse context would be beneficial.

5. **Presentation and Clarity:** The paper is quite dense with information, which may challenge readers to follow complex discussions and results. A more concise presentation of results, with more clear visual aids, could enhance readability.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper presents a strong, well-thought-out contribution to the field of NLP by addressing a significant gap in evaluation benchmarks focused on discourse phenomena. Its thorough experimental analysis and the introduction of a rich set of resources would be invaluable for researchers aiming to develop more sophisticated understanding and generation models that align well with human linguistic capabilities. With some enhancements in clarity and breadth of resource applicability, Disco-Bench may set a new standard for discourse-aware language modeling evaluations.
