## Review of "Graph Convolutions Enrich the Self-Attention in Transformers"

This paper presents Graph-Filter-based Self-Attention (GFSA), a novel approach to enhance Transformer performance by redesigning the self-attention mechanism from a graph signal processing (GSP) perspective. The core idea is to interpret the original self-attention as a simple graph filter and propose a more general yet effective filter based on matrix polynomials derived from the attention matrix. The authors argue that GFSA addresses the oversmoothing problem in deep Transformers and leads to improved performance across various tasks.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Perspective:** The paper offers a fresh and insightful perspective on self-attention by framing it as a graph filter. This analogy provides a solid theoretical foundation for the proposed GFSA mechanism. This is a **nonparametric learning** approach that allows the learning of complex relationships without making strong assumptions about the underlying data distribution.
*   **Well-Motivated:** The paper clearly identifies the oversmoothing problem in deep Transformers and provides a convincing argument for why a GSP-based approach can mitigate this issue. The connection to existing work on GCN oversmoothing is also well established.
*   **Simple and Effective Design:** The proposed GFSA filter, consisting of an identity term and two matrix polynomial terms, strikes a good balance between complexity and performance. The first-order Taylor approximation further reduces computational overhead, making it practical to integrate into existing Transformer architectures.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper presents extensive experimental results across a diverse range of tasks, including computer vision, natural language processing, graph pattern classification, speech recognition, and code classification. This demonstrates the generalizability and effectiveness of GFSA.
*   **Significant Performance Improvements:** The results consistently show that GFSA improves the performance of various Transformer models, often by a significant margin. The improvements are achieved with only a small increase in the number of parameters.
*   **Clear and Well-Written:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to understand. The introduction clearly outlines the problem, the proposed solution, and the main contributions. The theoretical analysis and experimental results are presented in a clear and concise manner.
*   **Reproducibility Efforts:** The authors have made a commendable effort to ensure reproducibility by providing detailed experimental settings in the appendix, including pseudo-code, and making the code available online.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Ablation Studies:** While the paper presents comprehensive results, it would benefit from more detailed ablation studies. For example, exploring the impact of each term in the GFSA filter (identity, ¯A, ¯AK) would provide further insights into the mechanism's effectiveness. Examining the sensitivity to the weights w0, w1, and wK more thoroughly would also be beneficial. It would also be interesting to study each of the terms in GFSA with a fixed random number.
*   **Computational Overheads:** While the authors claim that the computational overhead of GFSA is minimal, the throughput analysis in Table 9 shows a decrease in throughput for DeiT-S with GFSA. A more detailed analysis of the computational cost, including both training and inference time, would be helpful. Also more discussion on time/memory tradeoff. The time complexity for training on larger datasets should also be further expanded.
*   **Choice of K values:** The choice of K, the order of the matrix polynomial, seems somewhat arbitrary. Although the sensitivity analysis is provided in the appendix, the paper lacks a theoretical justification for selecting specific K values. A more adaptive or learned K value could potentially improve performance.
*   **Nonparametric Learning and Relation to GSP:** While GSP is used to justify the architecture, the paper could further explore how the specific **nonparametric learning** characteristics of GFSA interact with the underlying graph structure and signal processing operations. How does this affect stability and robustness?
*   **Error Bound Tightness:** The theoretical error bound in Theorem 3.1 seems rather loose. The empirical error bound analysis shows that the actual error is significantly smaller than the theoretical bound. A tighter error bound could provide a more accurate understanding of the approximation's accuracy.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Conduct more detailed ablation studies** to analyze the impact of each component in the GFSA filter.
*   **Provide a more thorough analysis of the computational cost** of GFSA, including training and inference time.
*   **Explore adaptive or learned K values** to improve performance and reduce hyperparameter tuning.
*   **Investigate the interaction between the nonparametric learning characteristic and the GSP framework.**
*   **Attempt to derive a tighter error bound** for the first-order Taylor approximation.
*   **Clarify the novelty relative to existing GCN methods.** While the paper discusses connections to GCNs, it could further emphasize the specific advantages of GFSA in the context of Transformers.
*   **Include the term "nonparametric learning" in relevant sections** to highlight the key learning paradigm.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach to improving Transformer performance. The idea of using graph convolutions to enrich self-attention is well-motivated, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GFSA mechanism. Despite the minor weaknesses mentioned above, this paper is worthy of acceptance and will likely generate significant interest in the community. The paper is insightful and presents a novel perspective for this area of research. It provides very useful information for the ICLR 2024 community.
