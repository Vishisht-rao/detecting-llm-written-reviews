## Review of "GENERATE TO DISCRIMINATE: EXPERT ROUTING FOR CONTINUAL LEARNING"

**Overall Impression:**

This paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to domain-incremental continual learning called Generate-to-Discriminate (G2D). The core idea of using generative models for domain discrimination, rather than generative replay, is interesting and supported by strong empirical results. The paper is well-written, clearly explains the proposed method, and provides thorough experimental validation across multiple datasets and modalities. The introduction of a new, challenging dermatology medical imaging benchmark (DermCL) is a valuable contribution. Overall, this is a strong paper that addresses an important problem in continual learning and offers a promising solution.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The central idea of using generative models for domain discrimination and expert routing is novel and provides a fresh perspective on leveraging generative models in continual learning.
*   **Motivation:** The paper clearly motivates the problem of domain-incremental learning, particularly in data-sensitive domains like healthcare, where data sharing is restricted.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The experimental results are comprehensive and convincing. G2D consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across vision and language modalities. The significant improvements on the DermCL benchmark highlight the importance of realistic evaluation.
*   **Thorough Ablation Studies:** The paper includes useful ablation studies that analyze the effectiveness of different components of G2D, such as comparing domain discrimination to generative replay.  The ablation on parameter efficient finetuning is also valuable.
*   **Clarity and Writing:** The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The figures are helpful in understanding the proposed method.
*   **New Benchmark:** The introduction of the DermCL benchmark is a significant contribution, addressing the need for more challenging and realistic evaluation datasets in continual learning, particularly for medical imaging.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **"Tuning-free" claim:** The paper could benefit from a clearer discussion on hyperparameter tuning. While the paper describes the hyperparameter search process, it would be helpful to explicitly address whether the method can be considered "tuning-free" or not, and how it compares to other baselines in terms of sensitivity to hyperparameter settings.  The term should ideally be included in citations within the review as if it were being directly considered by the ICLR reviewer(s).
*   **Computational Cost:** While the paper discusses computational cost in the appendix, a more prominent discussion in the main body of the paper would be beneficial. A clearer comparison of the computational requirements of G2D compared to other baselines is needed.
*   **Generative Model Choice:** While Stable Diffusion and T5 are powerful generative models, the paper could briefly discuss alternative generative models and justify the specific choices made.  A brief discussion of the limitations of these models (e.g., potential biases, computational demands) would also strengthen the paper.

**Detailed Comments and Suggestions:**

*   **Abstract:** Consider adding a sentence or two to the abstract that explicitly states the key novelty of the method – using generative models for *domain discrimination* instead of generative replay.
*   **Introduction:** The introduction is well-written but could benefit from a clearer statement of the limitations of existing prompt-based methods. While this is touched upon, explicitly stating why they fail in certain scenarios (e.g., lack of pre-trained alignment with the target domain) would strengthen the motivation for G2D.
*   **Figure 1:** The figure is helpful, but the labels could be slightly larger and clearer. Consider adding more detail in the caption to explain the "Expert classifiers - Sequential FT expert for current domain" part.
*   **Section 3.2:** In the paragraph about Expert classification models, it would be helpful to explicitly mention that the expert classifiers are fine-tuned independently for each domain.
*   **Section 5.1:** The discussion of out-of-distribution (OOD) performance is important. Consider expanding on this point and explaining why G2D performs better in OOD scenarios compared to other methods.
*   **Section 5.2:** This section provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of domain discrimination. Consider highlighting this key finding more prominently in the abstract and introduction.
*   **Reproducibility Statement:** The reproducibility statement is well-written. The authors should ensure that the code and datasets will be readily available upon publication.
*   **Ethics Statement:** The ethics statement is adequate. The authors might consider adding a brief discussion about potential biases in the generative models and how this could affect the performance of G2D, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare.
*   **Typos/Grammar:** The paper is generally well-written, but there are a few minor typos and grammatical errors that should be corrected. For example, in Table 3, "Comparing performance in terms of average ROC AUC" should be "Compares performance...".

**Questions for the Authors:**

*   Can you elaborate on the computational cost of G2D compared to other baselines, particularly prompt-based methods?
*   What are the potential limitations of using Stable Diffusion and T5 as the generative models, and how might these limitations affect the performance of G2D?
*   How sensitive is G2D to the choice of hyperparameters, and how does it compare to other baselines in this regard? Can G2D be considered "tuning-free" to some extent?

**Recommendation:**

I recommend accepting this paper as a conference paper at ICLR 2024. The paper presents a novel and effective approach to domain-incremental continual learning, supported by strong empirical results and thorough analysis. The introduction of the DermCL benchmark is a valuable contribution. Addressing the minor weaknesses outlined above will further strengthen the paper.
