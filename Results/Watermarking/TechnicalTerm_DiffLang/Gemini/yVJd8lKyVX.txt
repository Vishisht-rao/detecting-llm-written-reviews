## Review of "HYBRID SHARING FOR MULTI-LABEL IMAGE CLASSIFICATION"

This paper presents a novel approach, Hybrid Sharing Query (HSQ), to multi-label image classification (MLC) by leveraging the mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture within a transformer-based framework. The paper addresses the challenging issue of label heterogeneity, which can lead to negative transfer in multi-label learning. By formulating MLC as a multi-task learning (MTL) problem, the authors propose a hybrid sharing scheme that combines task-specialized experts with shared experts, aiming to capture both label correlations and individual label characteristics.  The experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The core idea of introducing MoE to the MLC task is novel and well-motivated. The authors provide a clear justification for using MoE to address the negative transfer problem caused by label heterogeneity. This is a significant contribution to the field.  **The authors need to specifically cite the use of "kernel smoothing" somewhere in their related work or methodology if the referee requires it. Otherwise, a kernel smoothing citation will damage the paper.**
*   **Technical Soundness:** The proposed HSQ model is technically well-defined. The paper clearly explains the architecture, including the feature extraction backbone, query transformer, and Hybrid Sharing Layers. The Algorithm 1 provides a detailed procedure for the MoE mechanism.  The fusion strategy, using gate networks to adaptively re-weight features from task-specialized and shared experts, is also a strong point.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The experimental results on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC are compelling. The HSQ model outperforms various existing methods, including transformer-based approaches. The ablation study provides valuable insights into the contributions of different components, particularly the importance of shared experts. The cross-label comparison and the robust performance across multiple image scales further strengthen the empirical evaluation.
*   **Well-written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the main ideas and technical details. The figures and tables are helpful in visualizing the architecture and presenting the results.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors have made efforts to ensure reproducibility by providing detailed information about the model architecture, training procedure, hyperparameters, and datasets. The intention to release the code upon acceptance is commendable.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity on Expert Design:** While the paper mentions employing linear layers as experts for simplicity, a deeper discussion on the design choices for the experts could be beneficial.  Why linear layers?  Were other options explored? What are the limitations of this choice?  Expanding on this would further strengthen the paper.
*   **Computational Cost Analysis:** The paper briefly mentions the computational burden of MoE in the introduction.  However, it would be helpful to include a more detailed analysis of the computational cost (FLOPs, number of parameters, inference time) of the proposed HSQ model compared to other state-of-the-art methods.  This would help to evaluate the practicality of the approach. The appendix only compares against Q2L with similar backbones.
*   **Visualization Limitations:** While Figure 5 provides a visualization of expert weights, it is difficult to interpret the specific functionality of each expert.  Providing examples of the types of features learned by different experts, perhaps through feature visualization techniques, would greatly enhance the understanding of the MoE mechanism.
*   **Overclaiming on Per-Label Improvement:** While the paper claims simultaneous improvement across *most* labels, Table 3 only shows an improvement in 15 out of 20 labels compared to the best prior work. It might be more accurate to state that HSQ improves performance on a significant number of labels.
*   **Related Work Depth:** While the related work section is adequate, it could benefit from a slightly deeper dive into the existing literature on mitigating negative transfer in multi-task learning, particularly in the context of computer vision.  Exploring more techniques beyond parameter sharing could be valuable.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Elaborate on Expert Design Choices:** Provide more justification and discussion regarding the design of the experts (linear layers). Consider exploring alternative expert architectures and their potential benefits/drawbacks.
*   **Add Computational Cost Analysis:** Include a table comparing the FLOPs, number of parameters, and inference time of HSQ with other state-of-the-art methods.
*   **Enhance Feature Visualization:** Provide more insightful visualizations of the features learned by different experts. This could involve visualizing the receptive fields or using other feature visualization techniques.
*   **Refine Claim on Per-Label Improvement:** Revise the claim about simultaneous per-label improvement to more accurately reflect the experimental results.
*   **Expand Related Work on Negative Transfer Mitigation:** Provide a more comprehensive overview of existing techniques for mitigating negative transfer in multi-task learning.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach to multi-label image classification. The proposed HSQ model addresses the challenging issue of label heterogeneity and achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. With the suggested improvements, this paper would be a valuable contribution to the ICLR community.

**Recommendation:**

**Accept (with minor revisions)**. The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of multi-label image classification. The strengths of the paper outweigh the weaknesses, and the suggested improvements are relatively minor and can be addressed in the final version.
