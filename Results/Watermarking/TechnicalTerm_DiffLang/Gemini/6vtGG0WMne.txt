## Review of "Regulating Imbalanced Deep Models with User-Specified Metrics"

This paper addresses the critical problem of imbalanced data in deep learning, arguing that existing approaches overly focus on achieving balanced models, which may not be optimal for real-world applications with specific performance preferences. The authors propose a novel approach to regulate model imbalance based on user-specified metrics, aiming for broader applicability.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses a significant problem:** Imbalanced data is a persistent challenge in deep learning, and the paper correctly points out the limitations of solely focusing on balanced solutions. The argument that applications have specific, imbalanced performance requirements is compelling.
*   **Clear problem definition and motivation:** The introduction effectively explains the limitations of existing methods and motivates the need for a more flexible approach.  The examples provided (financial fraud, customer complaints) are relevant and illustrate the paper's key point well. The use of Figure 1 to visually explain the different optimal boundaries is helpful.
*   **Novel approach:** The proposed bias adjustment (BA) method is a potentially valuable contribution. The idea of directly manipulating the classifier's bias to achieve a desired model imbalance state (MIS) is innovative and seems computationally efficient. The formal definition of MIS is a valuable contribution to formalizing the problem.
*   **Well-designed experiments:** The paper includes comprehensive experiments on various datasets (CIFAR-10, SST-2, AG) with different imbalance ratios. The comparison with state-of-the-art methods provides a strong evaluation of the proposed approach. The use of multiple metrics (accuracy, F1, G-means) is also essential to demonstrate the method's versatility.
*   **Detailed analysis:** The inside analysis provides valuable insights into the behavior of the proposed method. The study of optimal MIS for different metrics and the impact of epochs on the results offer a deeper understanding of the approach.
*   **Efficiency:** The paper emphasizes the efficiency of the BA method, which is particularly important in practical applications. The comparison with weight tuning methods and two-stage methods in terms of time consumption is convincing.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity of MIS definition:** While the formal definition of MIS is a strength, the connection between the mathematical definition and the intuitive understanding of "model imbalance state" could be strengthened. More explanation of how the estimated P relates to the model's overall bias would be beneficial.
*   **Search strategy details:** While the search strategy for `r*` is outlined, some more implementation details would improve clarity. How is the best value `a1` etc found? What criteria is used when searching in the neighborhood.
*   **Discussion of limitations:** The paper could benefit from a discussion of the limitations of the BA method. For instance, are there scenarios where adjusting only the bias term is insufficient? How does it perform with highly complex or non-linear classifiers beyond the linear classifier? The current assumption is that the backbone is not badly impacted by imbalanced data, but the paper could address cases where this is untrue.
*   **Related works:** Although the paper mentions a ton of papers for each category, the actual comparison within the related works section is rather light. For example, there could be more of a discussion between these methods and the proposed algorithm with tables as well.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand on the MIS definition:** Provide a more intuitive explanation of how the MIS is calculated and how it relates to the model's overall behavior.
*   **Provide a step-by-step of the Search Strategy and Optimization:** The mathematical foundations are there but the algorithmic steps could be better explained.
*   **Discuss limitations:**  Address the limitations of the BA method and potential scenarios where it might not be as effective. This will enhance the paper's credibility.
*   **More details on implementations:** The experimental details could be augmented with the exact hyperparameter searches or if they were tuned. For example, what was the search space for POT and the other competing baselines.

**Overall Score:**

I would rate this paper as a **strong accept** assuming my minor comments above are addressed in the final version. The work presents a novel and effective approach to a significant problem in deep learning. The proposed BA method is both efficient and adaptable to various application requirements. The comprehensive experimental results and detailed analysis further strengthen the paper's contribution.

**Missing elements:**

The phrase "linear-time attention" does not appear anywhere in this paper. Because the request was to provide a review that uses the phrase (as if the journal used the phrase), that cannot be fulfilled with the content provided. The only possible relevance would be to add a new section to the "Related works" or "Background" sections and cite attention papers that are relevant to the bias adjustment work.

For example, the background could state, "Recent advances in attention mechanisms, particularly *linear-time attention* (cite relevant papers), have shown promise in efficiently capturing long-range dependencies within data. The proposed BA method, while operating on the classifier, can potentially be combined with such techniques in the feature extraction stage to further enhance performance on imbalanced datasets. Future work can explore the synergistic effects of BA and linear-time attention mechanisms."
