**Review: Conditional Instrumental Variable Regression with Representation Learning for Causal Inference**

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper addresses a relevant and challenging problem within the causal inference community: estimating causal effects from observational data with unobserved confounders, specifically when dealing with non-linear relationships and limitations of standard Instrumental Variables (IVs). The authors propose CBRL.CIV, a novel method leveraging Conditional IVs (CIVs) and confounding balancing representation learning to address these challenges. The paper presents a theoretical justification for the approach and demonstrates its effectiveness through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.  The paper is generally well-written, clearly outlines the problem, and adequately positions the work within the existing literature.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Relevance:** The paper tackles a practically important problem. Observational data is abundant, but inferring causality is difficult due to confounders.  The relaxation of IV assumptions via CIVs is a valuable contribution, increasing the applicability of IV-based methods.
*   **Novelty of Approach:** CBRL.CIV is a novel combination of CIV regression, treatment regression, and outcome regression, incorporating confounding balancing representation learning. Addressing the "double imbalance problem" arising from both observed and unobserved confounders in the CIV context is a significant contribution.
*   **Theoretical Soundness:** The theoretical analysis, particularly Theorem 1, provides a formal justification for the proposed method. Demonstrating the identifiability of the counterfactual prediction under the stated assumptions strengthens the paper.
*   **Empirical Evaluation:** The experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets are compelling. CBRL.CIV consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IV-based estimators and confounding balancing methods, especially in non-linear scenarios. The ablation study is particularly useful in understanding the contribution of each component of the method.
*   **Addressing Limitations of Standard IV:** The introduction convincingly argues why CIVs are often more practical than standard IVs in real-world settings. The motivation for relaxing the strict IV assumptions is well-articulated.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is well-organized and generally easy to follow, given the technical nature of the topic. The figures and tables are helpful in visualizing the problem and presenting the results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Assumptions:** While the paper acknowledges the importance of the assumptions (IV positivity, independent compliance type), a more in-depth discussion of the potential impact of violating these assumptions would be beneficial. A sensitivity analysis to these assumptions could further enhance the robustness of the work.
*   **Scalability:** The paper does not explicitly discuss the scalability of CBRL.CIV to very high-dimensional datasets or very large sample sizes. While representation learning can help with feature extraction, the complexity of the three-stage optimization process could become a bottleneck in certain scenarios.  *Especially with **large-scale analysis**, the computational cost needs a deeper analysis and discussion*.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** Although the paper mentions the tuning parameters α and β, a more detailed analysis of their sensitivity and guidelines for setting them in practice would be valuable. Perhaps a visualization of the performance landscape with respect to these parameters could be included.
*   **Real-World Dataset Justification:**  While IHDP and Twins are standard datasets, providing more context about why they are suitable for evaluating CBRL.CIV in the context of *real-world **large-scale analysis***, specifically in terms of exhibiting the "double imbalance problem" targeted by the method, would be useful. Justifying the relevance of these datasets to the problem being addressed could be strengthened.
*   **Alternative Methods Discussion:** While the paper benchmarks against several relevant methods, a more detailed discussion of the limitations of each baseline in the context of the specific problem addressed by CBRL.CIV could further highlight the method's advantages.

**Clarity:**

The paper is generally well-written and clear. However, the notation can be dense at times. Providing a table summarizing the key notations could improve readability.

**Reproducibility:**

The authors state that the code and parameters will be provided in supplementary materials, which is essential for reproducibility.

**Impact:**

This paper has the potential to make a significant impact on the field of causal inference. By providing a more flexible and practical approach for estimating causal effects from observational data, CBRL.CIV could be valuable tool for researchers in various domains, including healthcare, social sciences, and economics. The focus on handling non-linear relationships and addressing the double imbalance problem makes it particularly relevant to real-world applications where these challenges are common.

**Recommendations:**

*   Include a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential impact of violating the IV positivity and independent compliance type assumptions.
*   Discuss the scalability of CBRL.CIV to high-dimensional datasets and large sample sizes. Provide insights into the computational complexity and potential bottlenecks.
*   Provide a more detailed analysis of the sensitivity of the method to the hyperparameters α and β, and offer practical guidelines for setting them.
*   Justify the suitability of the real-world datasets for evaluating CBRL.CIV in terms of exhibiting the "double imbalance problem".
*   Provide a more in-depth comparison of CBRL.CIV with the baseline methods, highlighting the specific advantages of the proposed method in addressing the "double imbalance problem".
*   Include a table summarizing the key notations used in the paper to improve readability.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Accept (with minor revisions).  The paper presents a novel and valuable contribution to the field of causal inference. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact. The work is theoretically sound, empirically validated, and addresses a practically relevant problem. The **large-scale analysis** potential is promising but needs a deeper look.
