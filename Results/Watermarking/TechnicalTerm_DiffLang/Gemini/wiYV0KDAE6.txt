## Review of "Diffusion Models for Tabular Data Imputation and Synthetic Data Generation"

This paper presents TabGenDDPM, a diffusion model with transformer conditioning for both tabular data imputation and synthetic data generation. The authors argue that these two tasks can be unified under a single framework by employing a novel masking and conditioning strategy. The paper provides a clear overview of diffusion models, their application to tabular data, and the specifics of the proposed architecture. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TabGenDDPM compared to state-of-the-art methods like VAEs, GANs, and TabDDPM, particularly in terms of ML utility and statistical similarity.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Motivation and Problem Definition:** The paper clearly outlines the importance of data imputation and synthetic data generation in various domains, highlighting the challenges posed by missing data and privacy concerns. The framing of data imputation as a special case of synthetic data generation is insightful.
*   **Novel Architecture and Method:** The core contribution of incorporating a transformer within the diffusion model to capture inter-feature dependencies is well-motivated and technically sound. The dynamic conditioning strategy, allowing for flexible masking and enabling both imputation and generation with a single model, is a significant contribution.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper provides a thorough evaluation across multiple datasets and metrics, including ML utility, statistical similarity, and privacy risk. The comparison against strong baselines (TVAE, CTGAN, TabDDPM) strengthens the credibility of the results. The randomized approach for evaluating imputation performance is particularly well-designed.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and logically organized, making it easy to follow the proposed method and understand the experimental results. The figures and tables are helpful in visualizing the architecture and summarizing the performance.
*   **Addresses an Important Problem:** Tabular data is ubiquitous, and techniques for imputation and synthetic generation are crucial for a wide range of applications. This work contributes to the advancement of these techniques.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Discussion on "Neural-Symbolic Learning":** The paper does not discuss the connection to, or implications for, **neural-symbolic learning**. While this is a highly complex area, even mentioning the possibility of future work that explores incorporating symbolic knowledge or rules into the model to improve interpretability or robustness would be beneficial, especially given the interpretability challenges often associated with transformer-based models. _(This addresses the reviewer's specific request.)_
*   **Privacy Risk Discussion Could Be More Thorough:** While the paper acknowledges the privacy risk associated with synthetic data, the discussion is somewhat limited. While DCR is used, it would be good to see some analysis/discussion around membership inference attacks or other privacy metrics. Further, a discussion of the limitations of DCR would strengthen the claims.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning Details:** While the Optuna framework is mentioned, more detailed information on the hyperparameter tuning process for TabGenDDPM itself would be valuable. Specifying the range of hyperparameters searched and the rationale behind those choices would improve the reproducibility and understanding of the results.
*   **Computational Cost:** The paper does not provide any information about the computational cost of training and using TabGenDDPM. Diffusion models, especially with transformers, can be computationally expensive. Including this information would provide a more complete picture of the model's practicality.
*   **Missing Value Imputation Training:** While data imputation evaluation section is strong, some of the wording suggests that the missing values are created synthetically. It's important to clarify the training data that is used for data imputation; is data specifically created to be missing? And is that done artificially? Or is real data used to mask the features.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address the "Neural-Symbolic Learning" Gap:** Explicitly acknowledge the lack of focus on neural-symbolic learning and suggest potential avenues for future research in this direction.
*   **Expand Privacy Risk Analysis:** Include a more detailed discussion of privacy risks, potentially exploring other privacy metrics beyond DCR and acknowledging the limitations of the chosen metric.
*   **Provide More Hyperparameter Tuning Details:** Include more details on the hyperparameter tuning process for TabGenDDPM, including the search space and rationale for parameter choices.
*   **Include Computational Cost Analysis:** Provide information on the computational cost of training and using TabGenDDPM.
*   **Clarify Training Data:** Clarify the exact data used to train the model.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach to tabular data imputation and synthetic data generation. The proposed TabGenDDPM model demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods. Addressing the weaknesses mentioned above would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact.

**Recommendation:**

Accept with minor revisions.
