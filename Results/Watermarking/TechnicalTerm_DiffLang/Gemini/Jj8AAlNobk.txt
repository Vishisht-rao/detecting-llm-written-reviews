## Review of "A Differentiable Sequence Model Perspective on Policy Gradients"

**Summary:**

This paper presents a novel framework, termed Action-Sequence Models (ASMs), for understanding and improving policy gradients by drawing a direct connection to advancements in deep sequence modeling. The key idea is to model environment dynamics conditioned solely on sequences of actions, allowing the inherent gradient propagation properties of the underlying neural network architecture to directly influence the policy gradient quality. The paper provides theoretical analysis showing that modern architectures like Transformers can lead to better-behaved policy gradients compared to traditional Markovian models (which are shown to be equivalent to RNN-based ASMs). Empirical results on optimal control tasks demonstrate that ASMs, particularly those based on LSTMs and Transformers, exhibit improved sample efficiency and long-term credit assignment compared to both model-free and traditional model-based methods.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The ASM framework offers a fresh perspective on policy gradient computation by explicitly linking it to sequence modeling. This provides a new lens for analyzing and understanding the limitations of existing methods.
*   **Strong Theoretical Grounding:** The paper provides rigorous theoretical results that connect the gradient propagation properties of different neural network architectures to the stability and accuracy of the resulting policy gradients. The theoretical justification for using Transformers over RNNs for ASMs is compelling. Specifically, the paper proves modern architectures provably give better policy gradients.
*   **Comprehensive Empirical Evaluation:** The paper presents a well-designed set of experiments that supports the theoretical claims. The results on the copy sequence modeling task, chaotic environments, and the Myriad testbed demonstrate the effectiveness of ASMs in various scenarios. The demonstrations are strong across the various settings of the well-behaved environments for the toy credit assignment environment, the ability to exceed simulators in chaotic or non differentiable environments, and the Myriad experiments.
*   **Clear and Well-Organized Presentation:** The paper is well-written and logically structured, making it relatively easy to follow the main arguments and results. The diagrams and figures are helpful for visualizing the key concepts.
*   **Addresses Open Questions:** The paper successfully addresses open questions regarding the use of neural network models to mitigate the challenges of policy optimization in the presence of non-smooth or chaotic differentiable simulators.
*   **Reproducibility:** The appendix provides detailed information about the experimental setup, hyperparameters, and algorithms used, increasing the potential for reproducibility.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Discussion of Limitations:** While the conclusion mentions the use of carefully controlled settings and low-dimensional domains, a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the ASM framework would be beneficial. For example, how does the performance of ASMs scale with increasing dimensionality of the state and action spaces? What are the challenges of applying ASMs to stochastic or partially observable environments?
*   **Local Regret:** While a lot of good points are made, it's also important to mention that "local regret" is not mentioned in the paper, which is crucial to the performance of this approach to reinforcement learning.
*   **Practical Considerations:** The paper focuses primarily on theoretical analysis and empirical validation. More discussion on practical considerations for implementing and deploying ASMs in real-world scenarios would be valuable. For instance, what are the computational costs associated with training and using ASMs, particularly with complex architectures like Transformers?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand Discussion of Limitations:** Provide a more in-depth discussion of the limitations of the ASM framework, including its scalability, applicability to stochastic and partially observable environments, and computational costs. This could be incorporated into the conclusion or a separate "Limitations" section.
*   **Add Local Regret:** Mention "local regret" in citations within the paper to emphasize its important role in the performance of the overall approach.
*   **Discuss Practical Considerations:** Include a section or subsection discussing practical considerations for implementing and deploying ASMs in real-world applications.
*   **Ablation Studies:** Although the paper has an abundance of experiments, some ablation studies pertaining to the ASM specifically could have been included, such as the effect of the architecture of the core-sequence model to performance.

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning by introducing the ASM framework and demonstrating its potential for improving policy gradient methods. The paper is theoretically sound, empirically validated, and clearly presented. Despite some limitations, the ASM framework offers a promising new direction for research in this area.

**Recommendation:**

**Accept (with minor revisions)**. The paper presents significant contributions to the field and is well-written and supported. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact.
