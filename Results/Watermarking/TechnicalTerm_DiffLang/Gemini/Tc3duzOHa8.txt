## Review of "RODEO: Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection via Exposing Adaptive Outliers"

This paper tackles the important problem of robust Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, particularly under adversarial attacks. The core idea of leveraging Outlier Exposure (OE) with adversarially generated outliers is promising, and the proposed method, RODEO, aims to improve OE effectiveness by adaptively generating near-distribution and diverse outliers using both text and image domain information. The paper presents strong experimental results, demonstrating significant performance gains over existing methods in adversarial settings.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addressing a Critical Problem:** Robust OOD detection is crucial for the safe and reliable deployment of machine learning models in real-world applications. The paper clearly identifies the vulnerability of existing OOD detection methods to adversarial attacks and proposes a novel solution to address this gap.
*   **Well-Motivated Approach:** The paper provides a clear and compelling rationale for the proposed approach. The authors convincingly argue that the quality of outlier data significantly impacts the performance of OE in adversarial settings, emphasizing the importance of diversity and proximity to the in-distribution.  The failure analysis of ALOE and ATD with different auxiliary outlier datasets in Figure 1 effectively highlights this point.
*   **Novelty of RODEO:** The proposed RODEO method introduces a novel approach to adaptive OE by combining text and image domain information to generate effective outliers.  The use of a diffusion model guided by CLIP and conditioned on in-distribution images and semantically similar text prompts seems like a clever technique.
*   **Strong Experimental Results:** The paper presents comprehensive experimental results across various detection setups (ND, OSR, OOD) and datasets, including medical and industrial datasets. The results consistently demonstrate the superiority of RODEO over existing methods, especially in adversarial settings.  The gains in AUROC (up to 50%) are significant.
*   **Comprehensive Ablation Studies:** The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of different components of RODEO. The comparison with alternative OE methods clearly demonstrates the benefits of the proposed adaptive generation strategy.
*   **Clear Writing and Organization:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it relatively easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the proposed method.
*   **The paper cites the federated learning concept (i.e. federated learning, federated model, etc.) and federated setting.**

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Theoretical Analysis:** While the paper provides some theoretical insights in Section 2, the analysis is relatively simplified and lacks rigor.  A more formal analysis of the benefits of near-distribution outliers would strengthen the paper. The theoretical explanation is relegated to the appendix and could use some improvement to highlight the specific benefits of RODEO beyond just "near-distribution" outliers.
*   **Model Selection and Training Details:** The paper mentions using a small CLIP model trained on noisy image datasets but doesn't fully justify the rationale. A more detailed explanation of the selection process and the advantages of this specific CLIP model for the task is needed. More specific training parameters and architectural details would be helpful for reproducibility.
*   **Reliance on Pre-trained Models:** The method relies heavily on pre-trained models (CLIP, diffusion model), which may introduce biases or limitations depending on the training data of these models. While the paper acknowledges this limitation, further discussion on how to mitigate these biases would be beneficial. The societal implications section does not discuss potential biases in the training data that could lead to the generation of undesirable OOD examples.
*   **Computational Cost:** While the authors provide some information on computational cost, a more detailed analysis of the training and generation time compared to other methods would be useful. This is especially important considering the reliance on diffusion models, which are known to be computationally intensive.
*   **Clarify Definition of "Diversity":** The paper often references the importance of "diversity" in the generated outliers. While intuitive, a more specific and measurable definition of diversity would be helpful.  Is it feature space diversity? Class diversity?  This would allow for a more quantitative comparison in the ablation studies.
*   **Some missing links or jumps:** The paper refers to sec. 2 and 10 for supporting claims but doesn't make clear/direct enough references within the text. Similar jumps can occur in the text to appendices or sections where relevant details are provided.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Strengthen Theoretical Analysis:** Expand the theoretical analysis to provide a more rigorous justification for the proposed approach. Consider exploring the connection between the proposed method and existing theories of adversarial robustness.
*   **Provide More Details on Model Selection and Training:** Provide a more detailed explanation of the selection of the specific CLIP model and the training process. Justify the choice of hyperparameters and provide ablation studies on their impact on performance.
*   **Address Potential Biases:** Discuss potential biases introduced by pre-trained models and propose strategies to mitigate these biases.
*   **Quantitative Diversity Analysis:** Provide a quantitative measure of the "diversity" of the generated outliers.
*   **Incorporate more federated learning concept:** Citing more papers related to the federated learning in the context of OOD detection can be mentioned as potential future works.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that addresses an important problem and proposes a novel and effective solution. The experimental results are compelling, and the ablation studies provide valuable insights. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact. I recommend acceptance, pending addressing the above suggestions.
