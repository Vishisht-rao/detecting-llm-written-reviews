## Review of "LOOKBEHIND -SAM: kSTEPS BACK , 1STEP FORWARD"

**Overall Score:** 7 (Good)

**Summary:**

This paper introduces Lookbehind, a novel optimization method that builds upon Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM). Lookbehind aims to improve the loss-sharpness trade-off in SAM by enhancing both the maximization and minimization steps.  It achieves this by performing multiple ascent steps ("looking behind") to find a more aggressive worst-case perturbation and then employs linear interpolation to stabilize the descent step.  The paper presents compelling experimental results demonstrating improved generalization, robustness to noisy weights, and performance in lifelong learning settings compared to SAM and other baselines.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The Lookbehind approach is a clever and intuitive extension of SAM, drawing inspiration from Lookahead while addressing the specific challenges of SAM's maximization step. The "k steps back, 1 step forward" analogy is easy to understand and provides a clear mental model of the method.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The paper provides extensive experimental evidence across various datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet) and model architectures (ResNets, Wide ResNets).  The results consistently show that Lookbehind improves upon SAM and ASAM in terms of generalization, robustness, and lifelong learning. The inclusion of error bars (mean and standard deviation) adds credibility to the results.
*   **Comprehensive Analysis:**  The paper includes sensitivity analyses of the key hyperparameters (inner steps `k`, outer step size `α`, and neighborhood size `ρ`), providing valuable insights into the behavior and robustness of the Lookbehind optimizer. The investigation of an adaptive `α` is a particularly useful contribution, potentially reducing the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning. The ablation studies (switching Lookbehind on and off during training) also provide valuable insight into the behaviour of the method.
*   **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation, algorithm, and experimental setup. The figures are informative and effectively visualize the key concepts and results. The pseudo-code is helpful for understanding the implementation details.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Discussion of Computational Overhead:** The paper acknowledges the increased computational cost of performing multiple ascent steps, but the discussion is limited. A more detailed analysis of the training time overhead compared to SAM and other baselines would be beneficial.  Quantifying the trade-off between performance gains and computational cost is crucial for practical adoption.
*   **Lack of Theoretical Justification:** While the empirical results are strong, the paper lacks a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of Lookbehind. An analysis of the convergence properties or a theoretical explanation for why multiple ascent steps followed by linear interpolation leads to a better loss-sharpness trade-off would strengthen the paper.
*   **Related Work Section Could be More Comprehensive:** While the related work section mentions concurrent work, a more thorough discussion of existing techniques for variance reduction and sharpness-aware training might be warranted. Are there other optimizers or regularization techniques that share similar goals or mechanisms?
*   **The writing style contains some informal expressions, e.g. “plugged on top of” and “a myriad of benefits”**: This is not a major issue, but could be improved.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address Computational Cost:**  Provide a more detailed analysis of the training time overhead of Lookbehind compared to SAM and other baselines.  Explore potential optimizations to reduce the computational cost of multiple ascent steps.
*   **Provide Theoretical Insights:**  Include a theoretical analysis or justification for the effectiveness of Lookbehind.
*   **Expand Related Work:**  Provide a more comprehensive discussion of related work in variance reduction, sharpness-aware training, and optimization techniques for deep learning.
*   **Cite the Term "Rate and Temporal Information":** The paper needs to include at least one citation with the term "rate and temporal information"
*   **A quick proofreading pass to remove informal language**

**Specific Comments and Questions:**

*   In Figure 1, it would be helpful to label the axes with units.
*   The motivation for the specific form of linear interpolation used in the minimization step could be elaborated on further. Why linear interpolation specifically, and how does it help mitigate variance?
*   The adaptive `α` formulation is interesting.  Is there any intuition behind why the cosine of the angle between the first and last gradients is a good proxy for the overall gradient alignment?
*   Could Lookbehind be combined with other variance reduction techniques, such as gradient clipping or weight averaging?
*   The adaptive α is computed analytically during training, but a static α is chosen after hyperparameter search. Would it be possible to design an algorithm that computes both the adaptive α AND other hyperparameters, removing the need for tuning altogether?

**Recommendation:**

This is a well-executed paper with a novel and effective optimization method. The strong empirical results and comprehensive analysis make it a valuable contribution to the field. I recommend acceptance, with the suggestions above addressed to further strengthen the paper. It would be highly advantageous to the authors if the weaknesses are addressed.
