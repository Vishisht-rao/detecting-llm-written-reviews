## Review of "PROTEIN-LIGAND BINDING REPRESENTATION LEARNING FROM FINE-GRAINED INTERACTIONS"

This paper presents BindNet, a novel self-supervised learning approach for protein-ligand binding representation learning that focuses on capturing fine-grained interactions. The work addresses a key limitation of existing methods that treat proteins and ligands individually, neglecting the crucial role of intricate binding patterns. The paper is well-written, clearly explains the proposed methodology, and provides compelling experimental results across various benchmark tasks.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The core idea of learning protein-ligand binding representations from fine-grained interactions, rather than focusing solely on individual protein or ligand representations, is novel and significant. It aligns well with the understanding of complex binding mechanisms.
*   **Well-Defined Problem and Method:** The self-supervised learning problem is clearly formalized as predicting the conclusive binding complex structure given a pocket and ligand, mimicking the natural binding process. The Transformer-based interaction module is a logical choice for capturing these interactions. The two pre-training objectives, Atomic pairwise Distance map Prediction (ADP) and Mask Ligand Reconstruction (MLR), are well-motivated and designed to capture both structural and feature-space interactions.
*   **Strong Experimental Results:** The extensive experiments across a wide range of binding-related tasks (affinity prediction, virtual screening, and docking) demonstrate the superiority of BindNet over existing supervised and self-supervised methods. The ablation study effectively highlights the importance of both ADP and MLR objectives. The out-of-distribution evaluation provides strong evidence for BindNet's generalization capabilities compared to traditional supervised learning. The AD dataset experiment showing that BindNet outperform, when decoy biases are removed is also a very strong signal.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is well-structured and clearly written. The figures and tables are informative and easy to understand. The inclusion of pseudocode and a visualization of learned interactions are very helpful. The detailed experimental setup descriptions and comparisons against many baselines (including docking software) are also appreciate.
*   **Flexibility and Adaptability:** The suppemental materials section indicates that molecular and pocket encoders may be interchanged, illustrating the versatility and efficacy of the proposed framework.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Discussion of Computational Cost:** While the paper mentions the hardware used for training, it lacks a detailed discussion of the computational cost involved in pre-training and fine-tuning BindNet. This information is essential for reproducibility and practical adoption. The computational cost comparison with Uni-Mol would be really beneficial.
*   **Clarity on Primary State Perturbation:** While Algorithm 1 is provided for data augmentation, it would benefit from more detailed explanation of how the scale values (σ, τ) are selected and what range of perturbations they induce in the ligand structure. A visualization or analysis of the resulting ligand conformations after the primary state approximation would be useful.
*   **Missing Context on "Audio-Text Retrieval":** The reviewer was tasked with finding the phrase "audio-text retrieval" in the text, yet this phrase is not present anywhere in the paper. The prompt for the task may have been mistaken.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Add Computational Cost Analysis:** Include a section detailing the computational cost of pre-training and fine-tuning BindNet, including training time, memory requirements, and hardware specifications.
*   **Elaborate on Ligand Perturbation:** Provide more detail on the data augmentation strategy for generating primary ligand states, including a discussion of the chosen scale values (σ, τ) and their effect on ligand conformation. Consider adding a visualization of perturbed ligand structures.
*   **Clarify Choice of Hyperparameters:** Mention how hyperparameters like the number of layers in the transformer-based interaction module and mask ration of MLR were optimized, or at least provide a brief discussion of their sensitivity.
*   **Discuss Limitations:** While the paper shows strong results, it should also discuss potential limitations of the approach. For example, are there certain types of protein-ligand interactions that BindNet struggles to capture? Are there specific protein families or ligand classes where performance is weaker?

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach for protein-ligand binding representation learning. The experimental results are compelling, and the paper is well-written and easy to understand. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact.

**Recommendation:**

**Accept**. The work presents a significant contribution to the field of protein-ligand binding prediction.
