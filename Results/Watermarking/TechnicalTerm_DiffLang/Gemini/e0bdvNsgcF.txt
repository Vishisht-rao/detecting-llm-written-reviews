## Review of "A-LOC: Efficient Alternating Iterative Methods for Locating the k Largest / Smallest Elements in a Factorized Tensor"

This paper tackles the important problem of efficiently locating the k largest/smallest elements in a tensor represented in a low-rank format. This is a fundamental task with applications in various fields like recommender systems, quantum simulations, and network management. The authors propose a novel alternating iterative method (A-LOC) built upon a continuous optimization model and enhanced with a maximum block increasing (MBI) approach and a block-search strategy. The paper presents theoretical convergence analysis and provides empirical evidence demonstrating the superiority of A-LOC over existing methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Significance:** The paper addresses a relevant and practically significant problem. Locating extreme values in tensors is a crucial task across various domains. The paper clearly motivates this with compelling examples.
*   **Novelty:** The proposed approach is novel and well-motivated. The continuous optimization model provides a solid foundation for the alternating iterative method. The MBI approach ensures convergence, and the block-search strategy effectively improves accuracy. The idea of leveraging the rank-one structure of the tensor to formulate the optimization problem is clever.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The introduction clearly outlines the problem, existing solutions, and the contributions of the work. The description of the proposed algorithms (A-LOC, MBI, block-search) is detailed and illustrated with Figure 1, making it easy to understand.
*   **Theoretical Analysis:** The inclusion of a theoretical convergence analysis (Theorems 2 and 3) adds significant value to the paper. The theorems provide guarantees about the convergence of the proposed algorithm.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The experimental results are comprehensive and convincing. The experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of A-LOC in terms of both accuracy and efficiency compared to several baseline methods. The speedups reported are significant.
*   **Generalizability:** The paper claims the method can be extended to other tensor formats.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Discussion on Scalability:** While the paper highlights efficiency gains, a more in-depth discussion on the scalability of the proposed method with respect to the tensor order (N), CP-rank (R), and dimensions (In) would be beneficial. While experiments are performed on larger tensors, a theoretical estimate of complexity in big O notation would be helpful.
*   **Block Size Parameter Tuning:** While the experiments suggest Algorithm 2 (with block-search) is insensitive to `b`, there's no guidance on how to choose an appropriate value of `b` in practice.
*   **Greedy Strategy Limitations:** The authors acknowledge that the greedy strategy for finding the k-largest elements is suitable only for small k. A more detailed discussion of the limitations of this approach and potential solutions for large k would be valuable.
*   **Proof Accessibility:** The proofs of Theorems 2 and 3 are relegated to the appendix. While this is common, a brief, intuitive explanation of the key steps involved in the proofs within the main body of the paper might improve accessibility.
*   **Reference Completeness:** While the references cover relevant works, the related work section could be expanded to incorporate more recent advances in tensor decomposition and optimization techniques.
*   **The paper doesn't seem to mention the term:** "universal 3d representation at scale"

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   Provide a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of A-LOC.
*   Offer practical guidelines for choosing an appropriate block size `b` for the block-search strategy.
*   Discuss potential solutions for finding the k-largest elements when k is large.
*   Include a more detailed discussion of related work.
*   Consider adding a brief, intuitive explanation of the key steps involved in the convergence proofs within the main body of the paper.

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper presents a well-motivated, novel, and effective algorithm for locating the k largest/smallest elements in a factorized tensor. The theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the superiority of A-LOC over existing methods. Despite some minor weaknesses, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field and is suitable for acceptance at ICLR 2024.

**Recommendation:**

Accept. Minor revisions are suggested to address the weaknesses mentioned above.
