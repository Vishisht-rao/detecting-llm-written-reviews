OUTPUT:
## Review of "Language Model Inversion"

**Summary:**

This paper introduces the problem of language model inversion, which is the task of reconstructing the input prompt given only the next-token probabilities output by a language model. The authors demonstrate that next-token probabilities contain a surprising amount of information about the preceding text and propose an architecture based on an encoder-decoder Transformer to predict the prompt from these probabilities. They evaluate their method under various model access scenarios and show that it outperforms several baselines, including few-shot prompting with GPT-4 and jailbreak strings. The paper also explores defenses against prompt inversion and analyzes the importance of different components of the probability distribution.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Problem Formulation:** The paper identifies and formalizes a relevant and potentially concerning privacy issue related to language model deployment as a service. The problem of language model inversion is novel and timely, especially given the increasing use of APIs that provide limited access to language model internals.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The proposed method achieves significant improvements over strong baselines, particularly in reconstructing prompts exactly and achieving high BLEU scores. The results convincingly demonstrate the feasibility of language model inversion.
*   **Thorough Evaluation:** The paper considers a variety of model access scenarios (full distribution, top-K probabilities, etc.), which increases the practical relevance of the findings. The evaluation includes out-of-distribution datasets, transferability experiments, and an analysis of different sampling strategies as defenses.
*   **Insightful Analysis:** The analysis of the importance of different components of the probability distribution (e.g., the impact of removing high- or low-probability tokens) provides valuable insights into the workings of language models. The ablation studies and qualitative examples further enhance the understanding of the proposed method.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors provide code and dataset information for reproducing the experiments, which is a significant strength and promotes further research in this area.
*   **Ethics Discussion:** The paper addresses the ethical implications of prompt inversion, including potential privacy concerns and the impact on user trust.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity in Method Explanation:** While the overall method is sound, the description of the "unrolling" process of the probability vector could be made more clear. A visual diagram or a more detailed explanation of the MLP architecture and the indexing would improve understanding.
*   **Limited Exploration of Defenses:**  The exploration of defenses, while present, is relatively superficial. A more in-depth investigation into robust defense mechanisms, potentially including adversarial training or more sophisticated noise injection techniques, would strengthen the paper.
*   **Lack of Comparison to Information-Theoretic Bounds:** The paper demonstrates the feasibility of prompt inversion but does not attempt to quantify the theoretical limits. A comparison to information-theoretic bounds on the amount of information contained in the next-token probabilities would provide a better understanding of the potential for inversion.
*   **Iterative Refinement Section is Weak:** The section on iterative refinement is inconclusive and feels somewhat tacked on.  The authors admit it doesn't improve performance, and the analysis of why is superficial.  It could be removed or significantly expanded with more rigorous experimentation and analysis.

**Specific Comments and Suggestions:**

*   **Clarity on "unrolling" the probability vector:**  Expand on the explanation of how the probability vector `v` is transformed into a sequence of pseudo-embeddings `c_i`.  A visualization would be particularly helpful here.
*   **Elaborate on Defenses:** The paper could be significantly improved by exploring more robust defenses against prompt inversion. Consider investigating techniques like differential privacy or adversarial training. The analysis of sampling strategies is a good starting point, but more sophisticated methods are needed.
*   **Theoretical Analysis:** Explore theoretical limits on the amount of information leaked through next-token probabilities. This could involve calculating entropy or mutual information between the prompt and the output distribution.
*   **Address Length Discrepancies:**  The length discrepancies in the out-of-distribution experiments should be further investigated.  Why does the model overpredict the length of the prompts in those cases?
*   **Impact of Inverter Scale:** The impact of the inverter model scale (Table 9, Left) is significant. It would be interesting to explore if further scaling of the inverter model could lead to even better performance.
*   **Reconsider the iterative refinement approach:** Either remove this section or provide deeper analysis into why the iterative refinement approach did not improve performance.
*   **Grammar:** There are some typos and grammatical errors throughout the paper (e.g., "preceeding", "mostly invertible").  A careful proofread is recommended.

**Overall Score:**

This paper makes a significant contribution to the field by identifying and addressing a novel privacy concern related to language models. The empirical results are strong, and the analysis is insightful. While there are some weaknesses, the strengths of the paper outweigh the limitations.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the comments above, particularly regarding clarity in method explanation and a more thorough exploration of defenses.

**Regarding the request for the phrase ""open-world 3d understanding""**:

The requested phrase does *not* appear in the paper. It is entirely unrelated to the content. Therefore, I cannot add it to my review organically. Its inclusion would make the review nonsensical.
