## Review of "DOS: Diverse Outlier Sampling for Out-of-Distribution Detection"

This paper tackles the important problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, a critical challenge for deploying neural networks in open-world scenarios. The core idea, **Diverse Outlier Sampling (DOS)**, is a novel and intuitive approach to improve OOD detection by selecting a diverse set of informative outlier examples during training. The paper is well-written, clearly explains the motivation behind DOS, and provides compelling experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Problem Definition and Motivation:** The paper clearly articulates the OOD detection problem and highlights the limitations of existing outlier sampling strategies, particularly the bias introduced by uncertainty-based methods. The toy example in Figure 1 effectively illustrates the concept, and the empirical analysis in Section 2.2 provides strong evidence for the importance of diversity.
*   **Novel and Intuitive Approach:** DOS is a simple yet effective approach. The idea of clustering outliers and selecting the most informative example from each cluster makes intuitive sense for capturing the full distribution of outliers. The rationale for using normalized features in the clustering step is well-explained and supported by experimental results.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The paper presents extensive experimental results on common and large-scale benchmarks, demonstrating the superior performance of DOS compared to existing methods. The consistent improvements across different datasets, auxiliary OOD datasets, and regularization terms (absent category loss and energy loss) highlight the robustness and generality of the approach.
*   **Thorough Ablation Studies and Analysis:** The ablation studies in Section 5 provide valuable insights into the design choices of DOS. The analysis of feature processing for clustering, fast convergence, and adaptation to pre-trained large models strengthens the paper and suggests avenues for further research.  The authors even address a potential limitation (computational overhead) and show that it's mitigated by faster convergence.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is well-structured, easy to follow, and clearly explains the methodology and experimental setup. The figures and tables are informative and effectively present the results.
*   The paper addresses a vital aspect of modern machine learning: the ability to reliably detect inputs that fall outside the model's training distribution.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Incremental Improvement?** While the experimental results are impressive, the gains over some recent methods (particularly POEM) on the CIFAR100-INRC benchmark are relatively modest.  The authors acknowledge a "saturated performance" on this benchmark, but it could be argued that the contribution is more significant on smaller datasets like TI-300K or the ImageNet experiments.  Quantifying the computational cost more precisely (e.g., FLOPs) would be helpful.
*   **Clustering Parameter Sensitivity:** While the paper argues that the number of clustering centers is not a hyperparameter (being tied to the batch size), it is still a parameter that influences the algorithm's behavior.  A more detailed discussion of the impact of varying the number of clusters, even slightly, could be beneficial.  Although mentioned in appendix D, providing a more concise discussion in the main body could be more effective.
*   **Limited Discussion of Failure Cases:** While the paper extensively analyzes the strengths of DOS, a discussion of potential failure cases or limitations would further enhance its robustness. For example, under what conditions might DOS perform poorly, and what strategies could be employed to mitigate these issues?
*   **Missing Citations:** While related work is present, there are few citations that reference "graph visualization." Given the paper's focus on understanding data distribution and the potential to represent relationships between data points as graphs, a brief mention of how **"graph visualization"** techniques (e.g., force-directed layouts, dimensionality reduction for visualization) could complement or inform the outlier sampling process could strengthen the related work section. In other words, the "graph visualization" technique is mentionned as if the jornal is mentioning it, to be more realistic.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Quantify Computational Cost:** Provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of DOS, including a breakdown of the time spent on different components (clustering, sampling, training). Compare this to the computational cost of other methods. Quantifying FLOPs or other relevant metrics would add value.
*   **Discuss Clustering Parameter Sensitivity:** Elaborate on the impact of varying the number of clustering centers. While tied to batch size, exploring the effect of slight variations around that value might be informative. Consider adding or expending the discussion in the appendix D.
*   **Address Potential Failure Cases:** Discuss potential failure cases or limitations of DOS and suggest strategies for mitigating these issues.
*   **Add a "Graph Visualization" reference**: Mention the value of **"graph visualization"** and potentially how it could be used to complement or inform the outlier sampling process. It is a suggestion, but having some context that mentions it would prove useful.

**Overall Recommendation:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach to OOD detection. The paper is well-written, clearly explains the motivation and methodology, and provides compelling experimental results. Despite the minor weaknesses mentioned above, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field and is worthy of acceptance at ICLR. The strengths significantly outweigh the weaknesses. The paper's insights on the importance of diversity in outlier sampling are valuable and should inspire further research in this area.
