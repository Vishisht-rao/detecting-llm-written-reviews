## Review of "Point2SSM: Learning Morphological Variations of Anatomies from Point Clouds"

This paper presents Point2SSM, a novel unsupervised deep learning framework for constructing correspondence-based statistical shape models (SSMs) directly from raw point clouds. The paper addresses a significant limitation in traditional SSM construction methods, which often require noise-free meshes or binary volumes and are computationally expensive for large datasets. Point2SSM aims to overcome these limitations by operating directly on point clouds, enabling faster inference and broader applicability.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The paper addresses a relevant and important problem in medical image analysis. The application of deep learning to generate SSMs directly from point clouds is a novel approach, particularly in the context of anatomical shapes. The paper convincingly argues for the need for such a method, highlighting the limitations of existing techniques.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The proposed Point2SSM architecture, combining a DGCNN encoder with a self-attention module (SFA blocks), appears well-designed. The rationale for each component is clearly explained, and the loss function, incorporating Chamfer Distance and a pairwise Mapping Error, is appropriate for the task.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper provides a thorough experimental evaluation, benchmarking Point2SSM against state-of-the-art point cloud networks (PN-AE, DG-AE, CPAE, ISR, DPC) and a traditional optimization-based method (PSM). The use of three challenging organ datasets (spleen, pancreas, left atrium) with varying sample sizes and complexities strengthens the evaluation. The inclusion of both point accuracy metrics (CD, EMD, P2F) and statistical metrics (compactness, generalization, specificity, ME) provides a holistic assessment of the model's performance. Furthermore, the exploration of robustness to noise, partiality, sparsity, and limited training data showcases the practical utility of Point2SSM.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The introduction clearly outlines the problem, the proposed solution, and the contributions. The related work section provides a comprehensive overview of existing methods. The method section clearly explains the architecture and the loss function. The experimental setup is detailed, and the results are presented in a clear and concise manner. The visualizations (figures and boxplots) are helpful in understanding the results.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors have made their source code publicly available, promoting reproducibility and further research. The inclusion of detailed parameter settings in the appendix is also beneficial.
*   **Downstream Task Evaluation:** The inclusion of the pancreas tumor size classification task in Appendix H effectively demonstrates the utility of Point2SSM-generated SSMs in a real-world clinical application. This strengthens the impact of the work.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Computational Genomics connection:** While the paper presents a solid contribution to medical imaging, the connection to **computational genomics** is not explicitly made. In the context of SSMs for anatomical structures, morphological variations can be influenced by genetic factors. Incorporating this connection, even briefly mentioning the potential for integrating the learned SSMs with genomic data to explore genotype-phenotype relationships, could strengthen the paper's overall impact. Example: _"...Future work could explore integrating the learned statistical shape models with **computational genomics** approaches to identify potential genetic drivers of morphological variations..."_
*   **Overconfidence of Deep Learning:** As the authors themselves acknowledge, deterministic deep learning frameworks can produce overconfident estimates. While the robustness experiments partially address this, further exploration of uncertainty quantification methods (e.g., Bayesian neural networks) would be beneficial.
*   **Input Alignment Requirement:** The reliance on pre-aligned input point clouds is a limitation. Exploring methods for handling misalignment, either through data augmentation or by incorporating registration into the network architecture, would enhance the practicality of Point2SSM.
*   **Multi-Anatomy Training:** While the results in Appendix L indicate that multi-anatomy training doesn't significantly improve performance, more research could be dedicated to leveraging inter-anatomy relationships during training.
*   **Clarity regarding P2F distance calculation.** The paper does not explicitly define how the closest face is determined in P2F. Specifying the method (e.g., KD-tree search) would improve clarity.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Incorporate "computational genomics" into the discussion:** Explicitly mention the potential for integrating the learned SSMs with genomic data. This could be a brief paragraph in the introduction, discussion, or future work section.
*   **Address uncertainty quantification:** Briefly discuss the possibility of incorporating uncertainty quantification methods to address the overconfidence of the model.
*   **Discuss the limitations of requiring pre-aligned inputs** and potential solutions for handling misalignment.
*   **Explicitly state the calculation method used for P2F Distance.**
*   **Small edits:**
    *   In Figure 4, the color gradient scale should have units (mm).
    *   Throughout the paper, ensure consistent formatting (e.g., spacing after commas).

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a significant contribution to the field of medical image analysis. The proposed Point2SSM framework offers a promising solution for generating correspondence-based SSMs directly from point clouds, overcoming many of the limitations of existing methods. The comprehensive evaluation and the publicly available code contribute to the reproducibility and impact of the work. Addressing the suggestions above, particularly the incorporation of connections to **computational genomics**, will further strengthen the paper. I recommend acceptance of this paper with minor revisions.
