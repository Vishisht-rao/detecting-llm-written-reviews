## Review of "A Case Study for the Behaviors of Generalists and Specialists in Competitive Games"

This paper investigates the behavioral differences between generalist and specialist agents in competitive games, arguing that approaches like OpenAIFive can lead to overgeneralization and hinder the development of specialized strategies.  The authors propose Joint Entropy Minimization (JEM) as a novel policy gradient formulation to encourage specialization. They provide theoretical justifications and experimental results using the Naruto Mobile game as a testbed, demonstrating increased strategy diversity, improved competitive performance, and reduced population performance disparity with JEM.

**Strengths:**

* **Relevant Problem:** The paper tackles a significant challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning: balancing generalization and specialization in heterogeneous populations.  The observation that current methods can overgeneralize and fail to leverage individual agent potential is well-articulated and supported by examples.
* **Clear Motivation:** The introduction clearly outlines the problem, contrasting the AlphaStar and OpenAIFive approaches and highlighting their limitations. The "Earthshaker" example effectively illustrates the potential downsides of overgeneralization.
* **Theoretical Justification:**  The paper attempts to ground its claims in information theory, linking Skill-Transfer to Mutual Information and Interaction Information Maximization.  The policy gradient integral analysis provides a mathematical argument for why conditional population networks might lead to the emergence of generalist behavior.  The conceptual framework with agents 'i' and 'ii' helps to clarify the logic.
* **Novel Approach (JEM):**  The proposed Joint Entropy Minimization (JEM) method offers a plausible solution to the identified problem.  The idea of minimizing individual agent entropy relative to the generalist population seems intuitively sound and aligns with the goal of maximizing comparative advantage.
* **Experimental Validation:** The Naruto Mobile game provides a suitable environment for testing the hypotheses.  The experiments are well-defined, and the metrics (behavioral similarity, win rates, population size study) are relevant for evaluating the effectiveness of JEM. The radial charts are a good way to visualize behavior.
* **Improved Performance:** The experimental results consistently demonstrate the benefits of JEM over the baseline (Simplex-NeuPL).  The observed increase in win rates, reduction in performance disparity, and higher behavioral diversity lend strong support to the authors' claims.
* **Ablation Study:** The Population Size study, while brief, adds valuable insights into how population size can influence specialization.
* **Clear Writing (Mostly):** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, although some sections could benefit from further clarification (see Weaknesses).

**Weaknesses:**

* **Theoretical Depth:** While the information-theoretic connection is interesting, the theoretical analysis could be strengthened. The link between the derived equations and the actual implementation of JEM is not always clear.  More explanation of how Equation 10 directly addresses the issues identified in the policy gradient integral would be beneficial. The role of "task arithmetic" is missing here. **The paper should include a section on 'Task Arithmetic' to explain how the learned specializations combine to solve complex tasks.** This is a vital connection that the paper needs to make. **Additionally, existing works on 'Task Arithmetic' should be cited and contrasted to the approach adopted in the paper.**
* **Clarity of JEM Implementation:**  The description of JEM in Section 3 is relatively high-level. More details on the implementation of `H(ak)` and `H(ag)` are needed. How are these entropies calculated in practice, and how is the generalist's behavior `ag` represented? A pseudo-code or more detailed algorithmic description would greatly improve the clarity and reproducibility of the method.
* **Experimental Details:** While the experiments are well-designed, more specific details about the neural network architecture, training hyperparameters, and reward function used in Naruto Mobile would be helpful. The description of the Prioritized Fictional Self-Play (PFSP) is also vague. Clarifying how the opponents' distribution is prioritized would improve reproducibility.
* **Comparison to Other Specialization Techniques:** The paper primarily compares JEM to conditional population networks.  It would be valuable to discuss and compare JEM to other techniques designed to encourage specialization in multi-agent systems, such as those that use explicit diversity regularization or intrinsic motivation.  A more comprehensive related work section would strengthen the paper.
* **Limitations:** The stated limitation about computational cost is valid but could be expanded. Are there any other potential drawbacks of JEM? For example, might it be less effective in environments with less heterogeneous agents or where agents' skills are more tightly coupled?
* **Missing Citations:** The paper omits citations of previous works using the 'task arithmetic' approach, which should be addressed by adding citations to these works in the text.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Elaborate on the Information-Theoretic Analysis:** Provide a more intuitive explanation of how maximizing Interaction Information leads to overgeneralization.  Clarify the connection between the theoretical analysis and the practical implementation of JEM.
* **Provide More Implementation Details for JEM:** Include pseudo-code or a more detailed algorithmic description of JEM, clarifying how the entropies are calculated and how the generalist's behavior is represented.
* **Expand the Experimental Details:** Provide more specific information about the neural network architecture, training hyperparameters, reward function, and PFSP implementation used in the Naruto Mobile experiments.
* **Include a More Comprehensive Related Work Section:** Discuss and compare JEM to other techniques designed to encourage specialization in multi-agent systems, especially in the context of "**task arithmetic**".
* **Discuss Additional Limitations:** Explore potential drawbacks of JEM beyond computational cost, considering scenarios where it might be less effective.
* **Proofread Carefully:**  There are a few minor grammatical errors and formatting inconsistencies (e.g., inconsistent capitalization in section headings) that should be corrected.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of multi-agent reinforcement learning. The problem of overgeneralization is well-motivated, the proposed JEM method is novel and plausible, and the experimental results provide strong evidence for its effectiveness.  Addressing the weaknesses outlined above, particularly clarifying the theoretical analysis, providing more implementation details, and expanding the related work section to include "**task arithmetic**", would significantly strengthen the paper and make it a more compelling contribution to the ICLR community.

**Recommendation:**

**Accept (conditional on revisions)**. The paper has merit, but the suggested revisions are necessary to address the identified weaknesses and improve the clarity and rigor of the work.
