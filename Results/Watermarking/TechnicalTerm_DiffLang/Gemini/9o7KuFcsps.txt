## Review of "UNIFIED ANOMALY DETECTION VIA MULTI-SCALE CONTRASTED MEMORY"

This paper proposes a novel two-stage anomaly detection (AD) method, AnoMem, that aims to address limitations of existing deep AD models, namely: (1) the trade-off between memorizing edge-case normals and generalizing to anomalies, (2) the inability to handle anomalies across different scales effectively, and (3) the lack of a unified framework for one-class (OC) and outlier-exposure (OE) settings. The proposed method leverages multi-scale normal prototypes learned through a memory-augmented contrastive learning (CL) framework to compute an anomaly deviation score. The paper claims strong performance across various anomaly types and datasets, while also offering a unified approach for OC and OE anomaly detection.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Soundness:** The core idea of jointly learning representations and multi-scale memory modules using contrastive learning is novel and well-motivated. The use of Hopfield layers for efficient memorization is a smart choice compared to traditional nearest neighbor approaches.
*   **Unified Framework:** The paper convincingly demonstrates a single framework that performs well in both OC and OE settings, a significant improvement over methods typically tailored to one setting or the other. The authors clearly articulate the challenges of transitioning between these settings in real-world scenarios.
*   **Multi-Scale Approach:** The introduction of multi-scale normal prototypes is a valuable contribution. This allows the model to capture anomalies at different levels of granularity (local vs. object-oriented) which addresses a key weakness of many existing methods.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper provides a thorough evaluation across a variety of datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CUB-200, WMCA), anomaly types (object, style, local, face presentation attacks), and settings (one-vs-all, OOD detection). The ablation studies are also insightful, demonstrating the contribution of each component of the proposed method.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The experimental results clearly show that AnoMem outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various anomaly detection benchmarks, including the challenging CUB-200 dataset. The relative error improvements claimed are substantial. The OOD detection performance is competitive, and the FPAD results are particularly impressive.
*   **Clarity and Organization:** The paper is generally well-written and well-organized. The method is clearly explained, with helpful diagrams and algorithmic descriptions. The related work section provides a good overview of the relevant literature.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** While the appendix claims that the model is not sensitive to `lambda_V`, and mentions that tuning was minimal when transitioning from OC to OE, a more thorough discussion of the hyperparameter tuning process would be beneficial.  Specifically, the section on selecting and tuning hyperparameters lacks sufficient detail. The authors should address how the sampling ratios `r` were selected, as well as the inverse temperature `beta`. While performance may remain consistent over various weights, a better explanation of how to choose these weights would be valuable to the reader.
*   **Lack of "Threshold" Discussion:** The paper does not mention the determination of an anomaly detection *threshold*, for deployment of the models.  The area under the ROC curve is a calculation which does not show the specific threshold required for a true/false determination of anomaly, based on deviation score.  The authors need to demonstrate how this value is chosen and determined, as well as how to account for different levels of false positives and false negatives. This is missing from the analysis.
*   **Memory Usage Comparison:** While the paper briefly mentions memory usage in the OOD detection section, a more detailed comparison of the memory footprint of AnoMem and other methods (especially CSI) across different datasets and settings would be valuable. This is particularly relevant given the emphasis on efficient memorization.
*   **Computational Cost:** Although the paper mentions efficiency compared to nearest neighbor methods, a more explicit analysis of the computational cost of AnoMem (training and inference) compared to other deep AD models would be helpful. The sampling process, memory layer updates, and multi-scale computations could be potential bottlenecks.
*   **Clarification of Hyper-parameters During Transitions:** The paper mentions easy-switchable OC and OE frameworks, and states that minimal hyperparameter tuning was done, but more precise hyperparameter values used in all of the different tasks, including OC, OE, and OOD, would make the conclusion more believable.

**Questions for the Authors:**

*   Could you provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process, especially regarding the sampling ratios, inverse temperature, and the scales used during the experiments?
*   How does the memory footprint of AnoMem compare to other methods (e.g., CSI) across different datasets and settings?
*   What is the computational cost (training and inference time) of AnoMem compared to other deep AD models?
*   Could you elaborate on the limitations of the linear weighting scheme for combining anomaly scores from different scales?
*   How sensitive is the model to the choice of memory size at each scale?
*   Can you provide a more robust analysis of how to create the threshold for anomaly detection?

**Overall Recommendation:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective anomaly detection method with significant advantages over existing approaches. The proposed method is well-motivated, clearly explained, and thoroughly evaluated. While some minor improvements could be made in the areas of hyperparameter tuning, computational cost analysis, memory usage comparison, and a better discussion on thresholds, the paper is worthy of acceptance at ICLR 2024. I recommend acceptance, pending minor revisions to address the weaknesses outlined above.
