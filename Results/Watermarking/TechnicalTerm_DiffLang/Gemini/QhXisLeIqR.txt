## Review of "WINNET: TIME SERIES FORECASTING WITH A WINDOW-ENHANCED PERIOD EXTRACTING AND INTERACTING"

**Summary:** This paper presents WinNet, a novel CNN-based model for long-term time series forecasting. WinNet leverages a predefined periodic window to transform the 1D time series into a 2D tensor, which is then processed by the Inter-Intra Period Encoder (I2PE), Two-Dimensional Period Decomposition (TDPD), and Decomposition Correlation Block (DCB). The authors claim state-of-the-art performance with lower computational complexity compared to existing CNN-, MLP-, and Transformer-based approaches on nine benchmark datasets.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Architecture:** The proposed WinNet architecture is innovative and combines several interesting components. The window-based transformation, period decomposition, and correlation learning represent a fresh approach to time series forecasting with CNNs.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The paper demonstrates impressive performance gains compared to established baselines on a diverse set of datasets. The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the contribution of each module in WinNet.
*   **Computational Efficiency:** The authors highlight the reduced computational complexity of WinNet compared to Transformer-based models, which is a significant advantage for practical applications. This makes the model more accessible and deployable.
*   **Well-Structured and Clearly Written (Mostly):** The paper is generally well-organized and presents the architecture and methodology in a relatively clear manner. The introduction effectively motivates the research and positions it within the existing literature.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity and Justification of Period Window:** While the concept of a periodic window is central to WinNet, the explanation and justification for its choice could be strengthened.  The process of approximating the window size based on the least common multiple of FFT-derived periods lacks sufficient detail.  A clearer connection between this window size and the actual periodic behavior of the specific time series would be beneficial. Appendix figure 8 is a start but needs more context and explanation.
*   **Limited Discussion of 'Image-to-Image Translation' Connection:** The paper mentions transforming the 1D sequence into a 2D tensor, however, it **completely misses the opportunity to explicitly connect this approach to the broader field of *image-to-image translation***. The transformation process inherently creates a form of an "image," and many techniques from that domain (e.g., convolution layers designed to deal with image data, image-based anomaly detection techniques) could be borrowed or adapted. Including a discussion of this connection and citing relevant literature would significantly strengthen the paper's contribution and positioning.  The lack of this connection is a major oversight.
*   **Missing hyperparameter tuning details** The paper doesn't offer details on how hyper parameters of the model where tuned. How the authors found the CNN Kernel of 3x3 to be the best kernel. The period size parameter is an important one and no details on how it was selected where mentioned
*   **I2PE Description and Justification:** The Inter-Intra Period Encoder (I2PE) is not very well motivated or explained. What exactly is happening at this stage? The mathematical notation isn't particularly helpful in understanding the process. Why use both inter- and intra-period representations? A more intuitive explanation is needed.
*   **TrendPadding Justification:** The TrendPadding method described in Section 3.2 seems unusual. While Figure 3 illustrates the process, it is not clear why this particular padding strategy is beneficial compared to standard padding techniques like zero-padding or reflection padding. More explanation of the underlying motivation for retaining trend characteristics during padding would improve the paper.
*   **Figure 1 Quality:** Figure 1, showing lag correlations, is difficult to interpret without more context. What exactly is being plotted? What does a "strong lag-correlation" look like in this visualization? Improving the clarity of this figure is essential.
*   **Limited Visualisation:** Figures 6 & 7 should have a lot more explanation. What are the axises representing.
*   **Fair Comparison:** The claim of lower computational complexity compared to Transformer-based models needs to be carefully justified.  While CNNs can be more efficient, it's crucial to ensure a fair comparison of model sizes and training regimes.  Have all models been optimized to the same degree? Also, most of the experimental results are taken from timesNet or PatchTST.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Elaborate on the Period Window:** Provide a more detailed explanation of how the periodic window is chosen and its relationship to the underlying periodicity of the time series. Include concrete examples.
*   **Explicitly Discuss *Image-to-Image Translation***: Add a section or at least a paragraph discussing the connection between the 2D tensor representation and *image-to-image translation* techniques. Cite relevant papers from the *image-to-image translation* field. Consider how techniques from that domain might be applied or adapted to WinNet.
*   **Clarify I2PE:** Provide a more intuitive explanation of the I2PE process. Explain why both inter- and intra-period representations are necessary and how they contribute to the model's performance.
*   **Justify TrendPadding:** Explain the motivation behind the TrendPadding method and compare it to other padding techniques. Provide evidence (e.g., ablation studies) to support its effectiveness.
*   **Improve Figure 1:** Enhance the clarity of Figure 1 by providing more context and labeling the axes clearly.
*   **Fairer Comparison:** Elaborate the hyper parameters tuning strategy and how hyper parameters were selected and also have the experiments run with your models and not taken from other research papers.
*   **Add Visualisation Explanation:** Expand the Explanation and details of figures 6 & 7 to describe what are each axis representing.
*   **Add Hyperparameter Tuning:** Add details on the hyperparameter tuning strategy and mention how each hyperparameter was selected.

**Overall Recommendation:**

This paper presents a promising and innovative approach to time series forecasting with CNNs. The empirical results are compelling, and the computational efficiency of WinNet is a significant advantage. However, the paper suffers from a few areas where further clarification and explanation are needed, particularly in connecting the 2D tensor to established "image-to-image translation" techniques. Addressing these weaknesses would substantially improve the paper and solidify its contribution to the field. Therefore, I recommend **conditional acceptance** with the requirement that the authors address the identified weaknesses and suggestions for improvement.

**Rating:** 6/10
