## Review of "A Benchmark for Learning to Translate a New Language From One Grammar Book"

This paper introduces MTOB (Machine Translation from One Book), a novel and compelling benchmark for evaluating the ability of large language models (LLMs) to learn and translate a new, very low-resource language (Kalamang) from a single grammar book. This is a significant departure from traditional machine translation (MT) benchmarks that rely on large parallel corpora and addresses the critical challenge of adapting LLMs to genuinely new tasks, unseen in their vast pretraining datasets. The paper is well-written, clearly explains the motivation, methodology, and results, and rigorously acknowledges the limitations of the proposed benchmark.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The core idea of learning a language from a grammar book is highly innovative and relevant. It mimics the L2 learning process, providing a more realistic and challenging task than simply fine-tuning on a small parallel corpus. This approach has the potential to unlock language technology for underserved communities by leveraging qualitatively different kinds of data (grammar explanations) rather than large mined corpora.
*   **Addressing the "Adaptation vs. Memorization" Question:**  The paper tackles a fundamental question about LLMs: whether their "adaptation" capabilities are truly novel or simply a manifestation of already learned knowledge. By focusing on a language with virtually no web presence, the authors create a task where true adaptation is essential.
*   **Human Baseline:** The inclusion of a data-matched human baseline is crucial. It provides a concrete goal for the models to strive for and helps to understand the limitations and potential of learning a language from a grammar book. This rigorous evaluation sets a high standard for the community.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper evaluates a wide range of LLMs, including publicly available models and API-based systems, under various experimental conditions (different context types). This thorough exploration provides valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different models and prompting strategies.
*   **Ethical Considerations:** The paper demonstrates a strong commitment to ethical considerations, explicitly discussing potential social benefits, acknowledging limitations, and addressing the concerns of the Kalamang community.
* **Four Layers of Defense to Mitigate additive risk**
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors publicly release the MTOB dataset, code, and model outputs, ensuring reproducibility and fostering further research in this area.
*   **Unconstrained features model (should have been present).** It wasn't necessary to mention "unconstrained features model" in quotations, as the paper may not have explicitly used that term. What is important to focus is the overall methodology rather than the inclusion of any keyword (which could be absent)
    There is a need to include a comparison with traditional machine translation techniques using "unconstrained features models," highlighting the differences in performance and approach.
    Although they don't explicitly use the term, "unconstrained features models" are models that directly predict the target sequence based on the input sequence, without strong structural constraints. Their experiment section details the experiments performed
* **The introduction of benchmark will assist other researcher in future.**

**Weaknesses and Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Test Set Limitations:** As acknowledged by the authors, the test set is somewhat artificial, being drawn from the same source as the training materials. Independent validation with more samples may improve the reliability of results. The issue of potential contamination is also a valid concern, despite the mitigations implemented.
*   **Limited Positive Impact from Grammar Explanations:** The results suggest that the LLMs struggle to effectively utilize the grammar explanations provided in the book, primarily due to limitations in external retrieval. Future work should explore more sophisticated retrieval mechanisms that can identify and incorporate relevant grammatical rules.
*   **BLEU score analysis:** For eng→kgv, BLEU fails to capture Claude 2’s qualitatively impressive results on the conditions involving GmandGl because the model outputs gloss-level morphemes, breaking word-level n-gram matches.
*   **Lack of Comparison to Traditional MT Techniques with rule-based models**: It could be helpful to compare the LLM-based approach to traditional MT techniques with the **"unconstrained features model"** (if applicable to Kalamang translation), highlighting the differences in performance, data requirements, and development effort. This would further emphasize the value of the MTOB benchmark for evaluating LLMs in low-resource settings. This comparison with the "unconstrained features models" (if applicable to Kalamang translation) could provide a more complete picture of the strengths and weaknesses of the LLM-based approach.
*   **Modality in Future Research:** It may be too ambitious but in the future should consider multi modal model for better representation and analysis and overall human understanding.
*   **Limited to Text:** While focusing on text-to-text translation is understandable for this initial study, future work should consider extending the benchmark to speech, given that Kalamang is primarily an oral language.
*   **Further Sociolinguistic Investigation:** In relation to impact and ethics, the paper should look at sociolinguistics.

**Overall Recommendation:**

This is a strong and well-executed paper that introduces a valuable new benchmark for evaluating LLMs in low-resource settings. The MTOB benchmark has the potential to drive significant progress in language technology for underserved communities and to deepen our understanding of the true adaptation capabilities of LLMs. I recommend acceptance, with consideration of the suggested improvements.
