## Review of "Fairness Without Sensitive Attributes via Noise and Uncertain Predictions"

This paper tackles the important problem of achieving fairness in machine learning models when sensitive attributes are unavailable. The authors propose a novel confidence-based framework, "Reckoner," which utilizes learnable noise and a dual-model knowledge-sharing mechanism based on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). The core idea is to leverage the observation that model confidence is correlated with fairness, and that by strategically introducing noise and sharing knowledge between high- and low-confidence models, improved fairness can be achieved without relying on sensitive attribute information.

**Strengths:**

* **Problem Relevance:** The paper addresses a significant and growing challenge in the field of fair machine learning. With increasing privacy concerns and regulations, methods that can achieve fairness without explicitly using sensitive attributes are crucial.
* **Novelty:** The proposed approach is innovative, combining confidence-based data splitting, learnable noise, and a dual-model knowledge-sharing framework.  The idea of learning from a "low-confidence" model to improve fairness is particularly interesting.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis:** The analysis of the COMPAS dataset, particularly the observation that age can act as a proxy attribute and the differences in feature distributions within high and low confidence subsets, provides a strong motivation for the proposed approach.  This analysis strengthens the paper's argument for the need for a new approach to fairness without sensitive attributes.
* **Thorough Experimental Evaluation:** The paper presents comprehensive experimental results on two widely used datasets (COMPAS and New Adult), comparing the proposed method against several state-of-the-art baselines. The ablation study provides valuable insights into the contributions of the learnable noise and the knowledge-sharing mechanism.
* **Clear Writing and Structure:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the proposed method and the experimental results.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Clarity on Learnable Noise:** While the concept of learnable noise is introduced, the specific architecture of the noise wrapper (the "simple two-layer MLP") could benefit from more detail.  How many hidden units? What activation functions are used?  More information here would allow for better reproducibility and understanding.
* **Confidence Threshold Selection:** The paper mentions following Lakkaraju et al. (2017) in setting the confidence threshold to 0.6. However, providing a justification for why this value is suitable for the specific datasets used in this paper would be beneficial. Is the performance sensitive to this threshold?  Did the authors experiment with other values?
* **Computational Cost:** The introduction of two VAEs and the knowledge-sharing mechanism likely increases the computational cost of the proposed method. While the paper touches on training efficiency by limiting the iterations of the Low-Conf generator, a more explicit discussion of the computational complexity and training time compared to the baselines would be valuable.
* **Generality of the Confidence Correlation:** The paper's premise rests on the observation that model confidence is correlated with fairness. While this observation holds for the COMPAS dataset, it is not clear whether this correlation is universal across all datasets and tasks. A discussion of the limitations of this assumption and potential scenarios where it might not hold would strengthen the paper.  Are there datasets where high-confidence predictions are *more* fair than low-confidence ones?  If so, how would Reckoner adapt?
* **Missing Related Work:** The paper doesn't explicitly discuss the role of random initialization in fairness. While the paper implicitly uses random initialization (as is standard practice), it's a missed opportunity not to cite relevant literature demonstrating its impact on fairness (or lack thereof) and to possibly incorporate this into the discussion. As requested.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Provide more details on the architecture and training of the noise wrapper.**
* **Justify the choice of the confidence threshold (0.6) and discuss its sensitivity.**
* **Include a discussion of the computational complexity and training time compared to the baselines.**
* **Discuss the limitations of the assumption that model confidence is correlated with fairness, and potential scenarios where this might not hold.**
* **Acknowledge and discuss the role of random initialization in the context of fairness, citing relevant literature.**

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and promising approach to fairness without sensitive attributes. The experimental results are compelling, and the ablation study provides valuable insights. Addressing the weaknesses mentioned above would further strengthen the paper and make it a more valuable contribution to the field.

**Recommendation:**  **Strong Accept (after addressing the minor revisions suggested)**
