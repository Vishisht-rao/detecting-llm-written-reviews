## Review of "LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS AS GENERALIZABLE POLICIES FOR EMBODIED TASKS"

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper presents a compelling approach, Large LAnguage model Reinforcement Learning Policy (LLaRP), for adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to embodied visual tasks using reinforcement learning. The authors demonstrate that LLaRP can generalize to novel tasks and instructions, outperforming existing baselines and zero-shot applications of LLMs. The introduction of the Language Rearrangement benchmark is a significant contribution that will likely spur further research in the field. The paper is well-written, clearly structured, and provides thorough experimental evidence to support its claims.  The release of the code and benchmark further enhances its impact and accessibility.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Approach:** Adapting pre-trained frozen LLMs with learned input and output adapters for embodied tasks using reinforcement learning is a novel and promising direction.
*   **Strong Generalization Results:** The empirical evaluation convincingly demonstrates LLaRP's superior generalization capabilities on the Language Rearrangement benchmark, especially regarding paraphrastic robustness and behavior generalization.
*   **Significant Performance Gains:** LLaRP achieves a substantial performance boost compared to LSTM-based baselines and zero-shot LLM applications.
*   **Introduction of a Valuable Benchmark:** The Language Rearrangement benchmark, with its scale and focus on generalization, is a valuable resource for the community. The detailed task definition, instruction generation process, and diverse evaluation datasets make it well-suited for future research.
*   **Detailed Empirical Analysis:** The experimental section provides a thorough analysis of LLaRP's performance, including ablation studies, learning curves, and comparisons with various baselines. The inclusion of both quantitative and qualitative results strengthens the paper.
*   **Efficiency Analysis:** Demonstrating improved sample efficiency and continual learning efficiency compared to other architectures highlights practical advantages of the LLM-based approach.
*   **Atari Results:**  Showing a performance boost on Atari games suggests LLaRP's potential beyond embodied manipulation tasks.
*   **Clear Writing and Structure:** The paper is well-organized, easy to follow, and clearly explains the methodology and experimental setup.
*   **Shift-equivariant attention:** While the paper doesn't explicitly use the term "shift-equivariant attention", the **paper uses LLMs, which inherently capture relationships between elements in a sequence regardless of their absolute position. This is achieved through the attention mechanism,** which allows the model to attend to any part of the input sequence when making a prediction. In the context of visual tasks, this attention mechanism enables the agent to understand and act based on relationships between objects in the scene, even if the objects are shifted or re-arranged.

**Weaknesses and Potential Improvements:**

*   **Limited Exploration of Different LLMs:** While the paper compares LLaRP using LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B, further exploration of other LLMs (e.g., GPT-3, PaLM) could provide additional insights into the generalizability of the approach.
*   **Computational Cost:** The paper acknowledges the significantly larger size of LLMs as a limitation. Further discussion on strategies for reducing the computational cost of LLaRP, such as model compression or knowledge distillation, would be valuable.
*   **Action Decoder Module:** The paper mentions that training the action decoder module might hinder the policy's ability to leverage world knowledge from the LLM. Investigating alternative action decoding strategies, such as directly interacting with the environment via the LLM's language head, is a promising direction for future research.
*   **Failure Mode Analysis:** While the paper describes common failure modes, a more in-depth analysis of the causes of these failures could provide valuable insights for improving LLaRP. This could include examining the LLM's internal representations or analyzing the training data to identify potential biases.

**Specific Comments and Suggestions:**

*   **Section 2 (Related Work):** The related work section is comprehensive but could benefit from explicitly addressing the limitations of using LLMs for decision-making tasks, such as the lack of grounding in real-world environments and the challenges of dealing with uncertainty.
*   **Section 3 (Method):** The description of the LLaRP architecture is clear but could be enhanced with a diagram illustrating the flow of information through the different modules.
*   **Section 4 (Language Rearrangement Problem):** Providing more details on the process of generating solvable tasks and handling edge cases would be beneficial.
*   **Section 5 (Experiments):** The experimental results are strong, but including confidence intervals or statistical significance tests would further strengthen the claims.
*   **Appendix:** The appendices are well-organized and provide valuable supplementary information.

**Conclusion:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of embodied AI. The proposed LLaRP approach is novel and effective, and the Language Rearrangement benchmark is a valuable resource for the community. The paper is well-written, clearly structured, and supported by thorough experimental evidence. While there are some minor weaknesses, the overall quality of the work is high, and I recommend acceptance. This paper will undoubtedly influence future research in this area.
