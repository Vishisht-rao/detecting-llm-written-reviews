## Review of "Out-of-Distribution Detection with Negative Prompts"

This paper tackles the important problem of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, focusing on improving OOD detection performance with large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP. The key idea revolves around augmenting the typical positive prompt-based approach with *negative prompts* to explicitly model what is *not* present in an image, thereby enhancing the model's ability to distinguish between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Problem Definition and Motivation:** The paper clearly articulates the challenges of OOD detection, particularly the limitations of relying solely on positive features. The motivating example in Figure 1 effectively illustrates the need for considering negative features to differentiate between similar-looking ID and OOD samples.
*   **Interesting Hypothesis and Novel Approach:** The core hypothesis – that incorporating negative prompts can improve OOD detection – is well-reasoned and aligned with recent efforts to improve relational understanding in VLMs.  The proposed "Learn to SayNo (LSN)" method, which learns a set of negative prompts per class, is a novel and practical solution to the challenge of capturing the diversity of negative features.
*   **Comprehensive Experiments:** The paper presents extensive experimental results on diverse OOD detection benchmarks (ImageNet-100, ImageNet-1k, CIFAR datasets), demonstrating the effectiveness of LSN compared to various baseline methods, including MCM, MSP, ODIN, and recent prompt learning methods like CoOp and CoCoOp. The results consistently show that LSN achieves state-of-the-art performance.
*   **Detailed Ablation Studies:** The thorough ablation studies provide valuable insights into the contribution of different components of LSN, particularly the impact of learned positive and negative prompts, the semantic orthogonality loss, and the importance of class-specific negative prompts. These studies strengthen the claims and offer a better understanding of the method's behavior.
*   **Analysis of CLIP's Understanding of "Not":** The experimental analysis presented in Section 3.1, demonstrating CLIP's limited ability to comprehend the concept of "not," is particularly insightful. Figures 3 and 4 clearly illustrate this limitation and provide a strong justification for learning specialized negative prompts.  In this section, the paper uses experimental observations to argue against the intuitive use of prompts such as "not a photo of a..." and therefore has to build upon alternative approaches such as "Learn to SayNo."
*   **Well-written and Organized:** The paper is well-written, clearly organized, and easy to follow. The figures and tables effectively present the key concepts and results.  The inclusion of the algorithm pseudo-code (Algorithm 1) and detailed dataset information in the Appendix enhance reproducibility.
*   **Relevance and Impact:** OOD detection is a critical aspect of deploying machine learning models in real-world scenarios. This paper's contribution to improving OOD detection using VLMs is significant and has the potential to influence future research in this area.
* The paper uses "attention steering," specifically through the use of both positive and negative prompts, to guide the network towards relevant features for OOD detection.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Computational Cost:** The paper mentions that LSN doubles the training and inference time compared to CoOp. While the performance gains justify this cost, it would be beneficial to include a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of LSN and potential strategies for reducing it.
*   **Dependence on CLIP:** The paper acknowledges that LSN relies heavily on the features learned by CLIP. While leveraging a powerful pre-trained model is a reasonable strategy, it would be helpful to discuss the limitations of this dependence and potential ways to make LSN more robust to the specific characteristics of CLIP's feature space. The performance of LSN with other architectures of CLIP also needs to be further evaluated and may be presented as a weakness to address in future research.
*   **Limited Training Sample Benefit:** The paper states that LSN doesn't significantly benefit from using even more training data. This could be a limiting factor. Exploring potential solutions, such as increasing the number of learnable parameters, could be considered for future research.
*   **Comparison with other post-hoc methods in the main paper** The comparisons are included in the appendix. They should have been included in the main paper.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Computational Complexity Analysis:**  Include a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of LSN, comparing it to other baseline methods. Investigate and suggest potential optimizations for reducing the computational overhead.
*   **CLIP Dependence Discussion:** Elaborate on the limitations of relying on CLIP's features and potential strategies for making LSN more robust to the specific characteristics of CLIP's feature space. Perhaps examine performance when training with CLIP models fine-tuned on different downstream tasks to evaluate its generalizability.
*   **Explore Techniques for Better Utilization of More Training Data:** Investigate alternative architectures or training strategies that could allow LSN to benefit from larger datasets.
*   **Expand Pos-hoc methods comparison:** Move the pos-hoc methods comparison from the appendix to the main paper.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach to OOD detection using negative prompts with VLMs. The experimental results are compelling, and the ablation studies provide valuable insights into the method's behavior. Despite the minor weaknesses, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field and is well-deserving of acceptance.
