## Review of "IMPACT OF AGENT BEHAVIOR IN DISTRIBUTED SGD AND FEDERATED LEARNING"

This paper presents an asymptotic analysis of Generalized Distributed SGD (GD-SGD) under various communication patterns and heterogeneous Markovian sampling strategies. The work aims to provide a deeper understanding of the convergence speed of GD-SGD, emphasizing the role of each agent's sampling strategy rather than focusing solely on the worst-case agent, a common approach in existing literature. The authors provide theoretical proofs for consensus, almost sure convergence to the optimal model parameter, and a Central Limit Theorem (CLT) characterizing the asymptotic distribution of the averaged model parameter. Empirical results support the theoretical findings and demonstrate the impact of different sampling strategies and communication patterns on the convergence of GD-SGD.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The paper addresses an important gap in the distributed learning literature by investigating the impact of heterogeneous agent sampling strategies on the asymptotic convergence behavior of GD-SGD. This is particularly relevant in real-world scenarios where agents may have different data access and computational capabilities. By focusing on the individual contributions of each agent, the paper moves beyond the limitations of worst-case analysis.
*   **Theoretical Rigor:** The paper presents a rigorous theoretical analysis, including proofs for consensus, almost sure convergence, and a CLT. The authors clearly state their assumptions and provide justification for their validity. The derivation of the CLT is technically sound and provides valuable insights into the asymptotic behavior of GD-SGD under Markovian sampling.
*   **Comprehensive Coverage:** The paper provides a unified framework that encompasses various communication patterns, including D-SGD and its Federated Learning (FL) variants. It also considers increasing communication intervals, which is a practical concern in communication-constrained environments. The thoroughness of the analysis makes the paper highly valuable to researchers in distributed learning.
*   **Clear and Well-Organized:** The paper is well-structured and clearly written. The introduction provides a good overview of the problem and the contributions of the work. The related work section effectively positions the paper within the existing literature. The results are presented in a logical manner and are supported by clear explanations and interpretations. The figures, while simple, effectively illustrate the key concepts and simulation setup.
*   **Connection to Existing Literature:** The authors effectively connect their findings to existing results in the literature, such as linear speedup and asymptotic network independence. They also demonstrate that their framework generalizes previous results on vanilla SGD. The thorough discussion of these connections enhances the significance and credibility of the paper.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The paper includes empirical results that support the theoretical findings. The simulations demonstrate the impact of different sampling strategies, communication intervals, and communication patterns on the convergence of GD-SGD. The empirical validation adds practical relevance to the theoretical analysis.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Strong Assumptions:** The analysis relies on several assumptions, including regularity of the gradient (Assumption 2.1), ergodicity of Markovian sampling (Assumption 2.2), decreasing step size and slowly increasing communication interval (Assumption 2.3), stability on model parameter (Assumption 2.4), and contraction property of the communication matrix (Assumption 2.5). While the authors provide justification for these assumptions, it is important to acknowledge that they may limit the applicability of the results in certain scenarios. In particular, Assumption 2.4 on the stability of the model parameter is difficult to verify in practice and requires case-by-case analysis. Future work could explore ways to relax these assumptions.
*   **Limited Empirical Evaluation:** While the empirical results support the theoretical findings, the evaluation could be more extensive. It would be beneficial to include experiments on more complex datasets and models, as well as to compare the performance of GD-SGD under different sampling strategies with other distributed learning algorithms. The exploration of increasing communication intervals is limited in the simulations and could use additional cases in practice.
*   **Lack of Comparison with Existing Finite-Time Bounds:** The paper critiques finite-time analysis based on mixing rates, emphasizing their focus on the worst-performing agent. While this critique is valid, the paper could benefit from a more direct comparison of the CLT-based approach with existing finite-time bounds, both in terms of theoretical insights and empirical performance. This could help to better understand the trade-offs between asymptotic and non-asymptotic analysis.
*   **Missing Probabilistic Machine Learning Context:** Given the topic of probabilistic machine learning methods is relevant, this paper should mention **probabilistic machine learning** to relate itself and to build connections to the existing literature, even if in passing. Citations of relevant papers in probabilistic ML would strenghen the work.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Discussion of Assumption Limitations:** Expand the discussion of the limitations imposed by the assumptions. Provide examples of scenarios where the assumptions may not hold and discuss potential approaches for relaxing them.
*   **More Extensive Empirical Evaluation:** Conduct a more comprehensive empirical evaluation, including experiments on more complex datasets and models, as well as comparisons with other distributed learning algorithms. Consider exploring increasing communication intervals more thoroughly in simulations with varying parameters.
*   **Direct Comparison with Finite-Time Bounds:** Include a more direct comparison of the CLT-based approach with existing finite-time bounds, both theoretically and empirically.
*   **Clarify Connection to Federated Learning:** More clearly connect the theoretical results and empirical findings to specific challenges and opportunities in Federated Learning. Discuss the implications of the findings for designing communication-efficient and privacy-preserving FL algorithms.
*   **Include "Probabilistic Machine Learning" context:** Mention the terms **"Probabilistic Machine Learning"** and cite relevant literature that ties GD-SGD and FL to probabilistic ML methods.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Despite the weaknesses mentioned above, this is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the distributed learning literature. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, the results are well-presented, and the empirical findings support the theoretical claims. The paper is well-written and addresses an important problem in the field. **I recommend acceptance, contingent on addressing the suggestions for improvement outlined above.** Addressing these suggestions will further strengthen the paper and enhance its impact on the research community.
