**Review: STYLIST: STYLE-DRIVEN FEATURE RANKING FOR ROBUST NOVELTY DETECTION**

**Summary:**

This paper tackles the problem of robust novelty detection, specifically addressing the challenge of distinguishing between semantic (content-related) novelties and stylistic variations. The authors introduce Stylist, a novel feature selection method that aims to identify and remove environment-biased features from pre-trained representations. Stylist ranks features based on the distributional distances between features across different training environments.  The paper demonstrates that removing highly ranked environment-biased features improves the generalization performance of several novelty detection algorithms on both real-world and synthetic datasets. The authors introduce a new synthetic dataset, COCOShift, designed with varying levels of spurious correlations to facilitate a more thorough analysis of the proposed method.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Relevance:** The paper addresses an important and practical problem in novelty detection.  The distinction between semantic and stylistic shifts is crucial in real-world applications where systems must be robust to irrelevant variations.
*   **Novelty of Approach:** The Stylist method is a simple yet effective approach to feature selection for robust novelty detection.  The idea of using distributional distances across environments to identify environment-biased features is well-motivated and clearly explained.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The paper presents extensive experimental results on multiple datasets, including the newly introduced COCOShift benchmark and adaptations of fMoW and DomainNet.  The results consistently show that Stylist improves the performance of various novelty detection algorithms, especially in the presence of spurious correlations.
*   **Thorough Evaluation:** The paper includes comprehensive ablation studies to validate the design choices of the Stylist method and to compare it with other feature selection techniques and dimensionality reduction methods.  The analysis of the impact of dataset spuriousness on the feature ranking process provides valuable insights.
*   **COCOShift Dataset:** The introduction of COCOShift is a significant contribution.  The ability to control the level of spurious correlations allows for a more controlled and detailed analysis of robustness to distributional shifts.
*   **Interpretability Insights:** The paper explores the interpretability of the ranked features, demonstrating that the top-ranked features are indeed predictive of the style of the images. This adds value to the method beyond its performance improvements.
*   **Clarity of Writing:** The paper is generally well-written and clearly structured. The problem formulation, proposed method, and experimental results are easy to follow. The figures and tables are informative and well-designed.
*   **Connections to Existing Literature:** The paper clearly situates its work within the broader context of domain generalization, novelty detection, and invariant learning. The discussion of related work is comprehensive and relevant.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Assumption on Style vs. Content Change Dominance:**  The assumption that style-induced changes in the data distribution are greater than content changes between environments might not always hold in practice.  The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of this assumption and potential strategies for mitigating its impact.
*   **Computational Cost:** While the method is simple, the computation of Wasserstein distances between feature distributions for all pairs of environments could be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets and high-dimensional feature spaces.  The paper could briefly discuss the computational complexity and potential optimizations.
*   **Limited Theoretical Analysis:** The paper primarily focuses on empirical results. While the motivation is clear, a more formal theoretical analysis of why the proposed feature selection method works could strengthen the paper.
*   **Presentation of related works:** Some references related to "learning to optimize" are missing, thus a comparison with methods that "learn to optimize" the ND performance is missing. Adding a small section on methods that "learn to optimize" the novelty detection performance and comparing the results would strenghten the paper. In fact, recent works have demonstrated a "learn to optimize" approach for OOD detection, thus this method could serve as a comparison.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Discussion of Assumption Limitations:** Expand the discussion of the limitations of the assumption regarding the dominance of style-induced changes. Provide potential strategies for addressing scenarios where this assumption is violated.
*   **Computational Complexity Analysis:** Include a brief analysis of the computational complexity of the Stylist method, particularly the Wasserstein distance computation. Discuss potential optimizations or approximations.
*   **Strengthen Theoretical Analysis:** Consider adding a more formal theoretical analysis, even if it's a simplified model, to provide a deeper understanding of why the proposed method is effective.
*   **Add comparison to "learn to optimize" methods:** Add a discussion regarding "learn to optimize" the novelty detection performance and a comparison with the state-of-the-art results.
*   **Minor Typographical Errors:** Proofread the paper carefully to correct any remaining typographical errors.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach to robust novelty detection. The Stylist method is well-motivated, clearly explained, and thoroughly evaluated. The introduction of the COCOShift dataset is a valuable contribution to the field. The paper is likely to be of interest to researchers working on novelty detection, domain generalization, and out-of-distribution robustness. I recommend acceptance, conditional on addressing the suggestions for improvement.

**Rating:** 7 (Accept, minor revisions needed)
