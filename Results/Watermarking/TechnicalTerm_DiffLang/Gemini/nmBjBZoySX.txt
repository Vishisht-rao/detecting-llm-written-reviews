## Review of "GRAPH LOTTERY TICKET AUTOMATED"

This paper presents AdaGLT, an Adaptive, Dynamic, and Automated framework for identifying Graph Lottery Tickets (GLTs) in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The authors address limitations of existing GLT algorithms related to manual pruning rate tuning, irreversible pruning, and scalability to deep GNNs. AdaGLT introduces layer-adaptive sparsity, dynamic pruning and restoration, and automated pruning scheduling. The paper includes theoretical justification for their approach and extensive experimental validation across multiple datasets and GNN architectures.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Significance:**  The paper tackles a significant problem in GNN research - the computational overhead of large-scale graph learning. The lottery ticket hypothesis offers a promising avenue for addressing this, and this work makes a valuable contribution to that area.
*   **Novelty:** AdaGLT presents a novel approach by integrating adaptive, dynamic, and automated features into GLT identification.  The key innovations – layer-adaptive pruning, dynamic restoration of pruned connections, and automatic pruning ratio scheduling – are well-motivated and address key shortcomings of previous methods.
*   **Theoretical Justification:** Providing a theoretical guarantee for layer-adaptive sparsification using the GNTK theory strengthens the paper.  The Theorem provides valuable insight into why the proposed approach is effective, especially for deep GNNs.
*   **Extensive Experiments:** The experimental section is thorough and well-designed.  The paper systematically addresses the research questions (RQ1-RQ3) through controlled experiments across diverse datasets, GNN architectures (GCN, GIN, GAT, DeeperGCN, ClusterGCN), and depth settings. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of individual components.
*   **Clear Writing:**  The paper is generally well-written and organized. The introduction clearly states the problem, contributions, and methodology. The method section provides sufficient detail for understanding and potential replication. The figures and tables are informative.
*   **Comprehensive Discussion:** The paper discusses the empirical findings extensively and draws insightful conclusions from the experimental results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity on Substructure Definition:** The paper mentions "core subgraph" in the abstract and elsewhere, but it could benefit from a clearer and more explicit definition of what constitutes this "core subgraph" or more broadly any type of **"substructures"**.  What properties are expected of these identified **"substructures?"** The paper identifies sparsity but lacks an explicit discussion of connectivity properties (e.g., connected components, diameter) or other relevant graph metrics that could define a valuable **"substructure."**
*   **Complexity Analysis Depth:** While the complexity analysis is included, it would be helpful to provide a more detailed comparison of the complexity gains achieved by AdaGLT compared to the baselines, particularly in the context of large-scale datasets and deep GNNs. Quantifying the actual reduction in computational time or memory usage would be a valuable addition.
*   **Justification for Specific Design Choices:** While the paper mentions alternatives and ablates some components (e.g., gradient estimators), a deeper discussion about the rationale behind certain design choices (e.g., the specific form of the edge explainer, the choice of the exponential penalty term for sparsity) would further strengthen the paper.
*   **Reproducibility:** Although the paper provides experimental details, releasing code would significantly enhance reproducibility and facilitate adoption by the research community.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Define Substructure Explicitly:** Add a section or expand on the existing preliminary section to define more precisely what constitutes a valuable **"substructure"** in the context of the GLT, mentioning connectivity, diameter, or other measures.  Connect this definition to the design of AdaGLT and discuss how the method facilitates the identification of such **"substructures."** Consider how various choices like edge explainer impact this extraction.
*   **Quantify Complexity Gains:** Include quantitative results demonstrating the actual computational savings achieved by AdaGLT in terms of training time, inference time, or memory usage.  Compare these gains to the baselines, particularly for large-scale datasets and deep GNNs.
*   **Elaborate Design Choices:** Provide a more detailed discussion on the justification for the specific design choices made in AdaGLT, such as the form of the edge explainer, the sparsity penalty term, and the choice of threshold level.
*   **Release Code:** Make the code for AdaGLT publicly available to enhance reproducibility and facilitate adoption by other researchers.
*   **Minor Edits:**  Proofread the paper carefully for minor grammatical errors and typos.

**Overall Assessment:**

This is a strong paper that presents a significant contribution to the field of GNN compression and the lottery ticket hypothesis. AdaGLT addresses limitations of existing GLT algorithms and offers a more adaptive, dynamic, and automated approach.  The theoretical justification and extensive experimental validation support the effectiveness of the proposed method. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further enhance the paper and make it even more impactful. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions based on the suggestions provided.
