## Review of "CONFIDENCE -DRIVEN SAMPLING FOR BACKDOOR ATTACKS"

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper presents a novel and interesting approach to improving the stealthiness of backdoor attacks by strategically selecting poisoned samples based on confidence scores. The core idea of using confidence-driven boundary sampling (CBS) to poison samples near the decision boundary is well-motivated and supported by preliminary theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments. The paper is well-written, clearly structured, and the results are compelling. It addresses an important and relatively unexplored aspect of backdoor attacks, namely the impact of sampling strategies on attack detectability. This work is a valuable contribution to the field and is worthy of acceptance.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The paper identifies and addresses the overlooked issue of random sampling in backdoor attacks. By proposing CBS, the authors introduce a novel sampling strategy that significantly enhances the stealthiness of attacks. This is a relevant and timely contribution to the field.
*   **Well-Motivated:** The paper provides a clear motivation for their approach, supported by visualizations of the latent space and theoretical analysis using an SVM model. The observations linking random sampling to increased detectability are convincing.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The authors conduct extensive experiments using a variety of backdoor attack methods (BadNet, Blend, Adaptive, Hidden-Trigger, Label-Consistent, Lira, WaNet, Wasserstein Backdoor) and defense strategies (Spectral Signature, STRIP, Anti-Backdoor Learning, Neural Cleanser, Fine Pruning, Activation Clustering, SCAn, SPECTRE). This comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the versatility and effectiveness of CBS across different attack scenarios.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is well-written, easy to follow, and logically organized. The introduction clearly articulates the problem, the proposed solution, and the contributions of the work. The method section provides a detailed explanation of CBS, along with theoretical insights. The experiment section thoroughly presents the experimental setup, results, and analysis.
*   **Theoretical Understanding:** The paper provides a basic theoretical analysis using an SVM model, which helps to explain the observed benefits of CBS. This adds depth and rigor to the paper.
*   **Versatility:** The paper highlights the versatility of the proposed method, showing its compatibility with various backdoor attack techniques.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Theoretical Depth:** While the theoretical analysis provides some justification for CBS, it is relatively basic and relies on a simplified SVM model. A more in-depth theoretical analysis, potentially considering more complex DNN architectures and loss functions, would further strengthen the paper.
*   **Parameter Sensitivity:** The effectiveness of CBS depends on the choice of the threshold parameter ϵ. While the authors provide some guidance on selecting ϵ, a more thorough analysis of the sensitivity of CBS to this parameter and a more robust method for selecting it would be beneficial.
*   **Mention of Physical Simulation is missing:** The introduction doesn't include the term "Physical Simulation," which could make a difference in the paper.

**Specific Comments and Suggestions:**

*   **Expand on the limitations of the SVM analysis:** While the SVM analysis is helpful, acknowledge its limitations in representing the complexity of real-world DNNs. Discuss potential ways to extend the analysis to more realistic scenarios.
*   **Address potential defenses tailored for boundary sampling:** While CBS improves robustness against existing defenses, it might introduce new vulnerabilities that dedicated defenses could exploit. Discuss potential defenses against CBS and suggest possible countermeasures.
*   **Discuss computational overhead:** Although it seems small, explicitly mention and quantify the computational overhead of the CBS method. Does it significantly increase the training time compared to random sampling?
*   **Clarify the relationship between ϵ and poison rate p:** While the authors mention the relationship between ϵ and p, provide a more detailed explanation of how to determine ϵ based on a desired poison rate.

**Missing Term:**

The term "Physical Simulation" is not present in the original document. I'd recommend the authors check the scope of the journal it's being submitted to, and if it is required, add a section relating the work to "Physical Simulation" or examples of the work's usefulness in that domain. This might involve discussing how backdoor attacks could be used to compromise physical systems controlled by DNNs, or how CBS could be used to improve the stealthiness of such attacks.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend accepting this paper for publication at ICLR 2024. The proposed method is novel, well-motivated, and experimentally validated. Addressing the suggestions above will further enhance the quality of the paper.
