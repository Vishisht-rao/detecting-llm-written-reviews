OUTPUT:
Okay, here is a review of the provided paper, aiming for a balanced perspective.

**Overall Impression:**

This paper presents a compelling approach to improving noise-robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) by leveraging large language models (LLMs) for generative error correction (GER). The core idea of using a "language-space noise embedding" derived from the N-best ASR hypotheses to guide LLM-based denoising is novel and promising.  The paper is generally well-written and clearly structured, with a comprehensive experimental section.  The results demonstrate significant WER improvements compared to baselines, especially on the newly introduced "Robust HyPoradise" dataset. However, there are areas where the paper could be strengthened, particularly in the clarity of certain methodological details, the depth of analysis, and a more thorough engagement with related work.  There's also a minor concern about the claims of "breakthrough" performance.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The idea of extracting noise information from the language space of ASR hypotheses, rather than directly using audio features, is a key strength. This addresses the challenges of cross-modality gaps in LLM finetuning.
*   **Comprehensive Experimental Setup:** The experiments are well-designed and cover a variety of noise conditions and LLMs. The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the contributions of different components of the proposed method.  The introduction of a new dataset, "Robust HyPoradise," is a valuable contribution to the field.
*   **Significant Results:** The reported WER reductions are substantial, demonstrating the effectiveness of the RobustGER approach.  The data efficiency analysis is also noteworthy, showing that good performance can be achieved with limited training data.
*   **Clear Structure and Writing:** The paper is generally well-organized and easy to follow. The figures and tables are helpful in understanding the method and results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Methodological Clarity:** While the overall concept is clear, some of the implementation details require further elaboration.  For example, the specific architecture of the MINE statistic network could be described in more detail. It is unclear exactly how "minus sign before the noise embedding ELN" can do the language-space denoising by "teach LLM".
*   **Analysis Depth:** The analysis of the results could be more in-depth. While the visualizations of the noise embeddings are helpful, a more quantitative analysis of their properties (e.g., correlation with SNR, noise type) would be beneficial. The discussion of the failure case is a good start, but more examples and a broader analysis of error types would strengthen the paper.
*   **Related Work Engagement:** While the paper cites relevant works, a more critical discussion of the limitations of existing approaches (particularly those attempting audio-based denoising for GER) and how RobustGER overcomes these limitations would be valuable. The connections to other recent LLM-based audio processing techniques should be highlighted. The recent works on post-recognition text modeling and LLM-based audio understanding should be discussed to clarify RobustGER's novel contribution.
*   **Overclaiming:** The use of the term "breakthrough" might be considered an overstatement. While the results are impressive, the paper should be careful to avoid hyperbolic claims. A more nuanced discussion of the limitations of the method and areas for future improvement would be more appropriate.
*   **"Structured and fine-grained sparsity":** The paper does not mention "structured and fine-grained sparsity" in its current form. This could be a potential area for improvement if the method can be related to sparsity concepts.

**Specific Questions/Suggestions:**

*   In Section 4.2, can you provide more intuition behind the choice of SBERT for extracting token embeddings? Are there other options that were considered, and what are the tradeoffs?
*   In Section 4.3, can you provide more details about the architecture and training of the MINE statistic network?
*   In Table 5, it would be beneficial to include the WER (%) score for the Baseline ASR without error correction.
*   Can you provide more quantitative analysis in Section 5.4 (Analysis) between cluster distances and objective quality scores?

**Recommendations:**

I recommend **Accept with Minor Revisions**. The paper presents a novel and promising approach with significant results. Addressing the points above would strengthen the paper and make it a more valuable contribution to the ICLR community. The authors should carefully consider the feedback and revise the paper accordingly.

**Detailed Comments and suggestions**:

*   **Abstract**:  Consider rephrasing "achieves a new breakthrough" to something more moderate like "achieves significant performance improvements."
*   **Introduction**:  Mention the challenges of noisy ASR and the limitations of traditional methods.
*   **Related Work**:  Expand the discussion of related work on multimodal LLMs and the specific challenges they face in ASR tasks.
*   **Methodology**:  Provide a more detailed explanation of the language-space noise embedding extraction process and the MINE-based audio noise distillation. Specifically, discuss how zero-initialization can achieve an effective trade-off between the pre-trained knowledge of LLM and the learned instructional knowledge through adaptation prompt.
*   **Experiments**:  Provide the WER of the baseline ASR, without any error correction, to provide a point of comparison.
*   **Analysis**:  Quantify the relationship between the noise embeddings and ASR performance, demonstrating how they correlate with SNR and noise type.

By addressing these points, the authors can significantly improve the quality and impact of their paper.
