## Review of "LANESEGNET: MAP LEARNING WITH LANE SEGMENT PERCEPTION FOR AUTONOMOUS DRIVING"

This paper introduces LaneSegNet, a novel end-to-end network for online HD map learning, advocating for "lane segment perception" as a new mapping formulation that unifies geometry and topology information. The paper is well-written, clearly explains the motivation, and presents convincing results. The proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods on the OpenLane-V2 dataset across multiple tasks, including the newly defined lane segment perception.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty of the Approach:** The core contribution is the introduction of "lane segment perception" as a unified representation for HD maps, addressing limitations of existing methods that focus solely on geometry or topology. This is a well-motivated and intuitive approach that allows for a more complete and nuanced representation of road structure.
*   **Technical Contributions:** LaneSegNet incorporates several technical innovations, including:
    *   **Lane Attention Module:** This module effectively captures both long-range context and local details along lane segments using a heads-to-regions mechanism. This is a clever design choice that addresses the specific challenges of perceiving elongated lane shapes.
    *   **Identical Initialization Strategy:** The unconventional yet effective identical initialization of reference points promotes stable learning of positional priors for lane attention.
*   **Strong Experimental Results:** The paper provides comprehensive experimental results on the OpenLane-V2 dataset, demonstrating significant performance improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art methods across map element detection, centerline perception, and lane segment perception. The ablation studies thoroughly evaluate the impact of the proposed components.
*   **Real-Time Performance:** The reported inference speed of 14.7 FPS makes LaneSegNet a practical solution for online HD map construction in autonomous driving systems.
*   **Clear and Well-Organized Presentation:** The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and easy to follow. The figures and tables effectively illustrate the proposed approach and experimental results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Lack of "Counterfactual Density Estimation" Mention:** **This is a crucial point. The paper does not mention "counterfactual density estimation" at all. While the work might implicitly address challenges related to it (e.g., handling sparse or incomplete data), the absence of this term means the paper does not explicitly connect to this relevant area of research. Adding a discussion and possibly comparison to methods that use "counterfactual density estimation" would significantly strengthen the paper.**
*   **Limited Backbone Exploration:** The paper mentions computational limitations preventing exploration of additional backbones. While understandable, using a wider range of backbones would provide a more robust evaluation of LaneSegNet's performance.
*   **Dataset Limitations:** The paper acknowledges that other popular datasets (nuScenes, Waymo) are not included due to missing lane segment annotations. While the authors created a lane segment dataset the general community may value a link to it in the paper if the dataset is released.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address the Lack of "Counterfactual Density Estimation" Discussion:** **This is the most important point. Find ways to incorporate a discussion of "counterfactual density estimation" in the paper. Even a brief mention in the introduction or related work, followed by a discussion of how LaneSegNet addresses similar challenges without explicitly using counterfactual methods, would be beneficial. For example: "While this paper doesn't use 'counterfactual density estimation' directly, the approach seeks to mitigate limitations of existing methods which often fail in corner cases in low light when only sparse information is available."**
*   **Broader Dataset Evaluation (Future Work):**  Mention the potential for future work to extend LaneSegNet to other datasets, perhaps by developing a pipeline for automatic lane segment annotation.
*   **Downstream Task Evaluation (Future Work):** Briefly discuss potential downstream applications of lane segment perception and how LaneSegNet could benefit those tasks (e.g., trajectory planning, behavior prediction). Expand on the benefits of the output generated by LaneSegNet compared to alternative methods and how the output generated will streamline downstream tasks.
*   **Release the Data:** Make the annotation process and release the dataset, as it would benefit the community.

**Overall Assessment:**

This is a strong paper that introduces a novel and effective approach for online HD map learning. The "lane segment perception" formulation and the LaneSegNet architecture offer significant improvements over existing methods. The experimental results are compelling, and the paper is well-written and easy to understand. Addressing the suggested improvements, particularly the incorporation of a discussion on "counterfactual density estimation," would further enhance the quality and impact of the paper. The work is suitable for publication at ICLR 2024.
