OUTPUT:
Okay, here's a review of the provided ICLR 2024 submission, incorporating feedback and explicitly mentioning "local regret" where appropriate (even if it seems forced).

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper tackles a significant and challenging problem in reinforcement learning: learning agent-centric state representations in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) with finite memory (FM-POMDPs).  The work addresses a gap in the literature, as prior methods have primarily focused on Markovian environments or have not explicitly focused on state discovery in non-Markovian, high-dimensional settings. The paper presents a theoretical analysis of inverse kinematics-based objectives and provides empirical validation in both simulated navigation environments and visual offline RL tasks.  While the theoretical analysis is sound and the empirical results are promising, the paper could benefit from a more rigorous connection to existing POMDP literature and a more nuanced discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach.  The presentation is generally clear, but some sections could be streamlined.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Relevance:** The problem of learning state representations in POMDPs is crucial for scaling RL to complex, real-world environments.  The focus on FM-POMDPs is a reasonable and well-motivated simplification that allows for initial progress on this problem.
*   **Theoretical Analysis:** The analysis of the Bayes-optimal solutions for different inverse kinematics objectives is a major strength.  The paper provides clear arguments for why some objectives (AH, FJ) fail to recover the full agent-centric state, while MIK+A succeeds. The counterexample for the Forward Jump objective is particularly insightful.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The experimental results in both the navigation environments and the visual offline RL tasks provide compelling evidence for the effectiveness of the MIK+A objective. The ablation studies (e.g., with and without self-prediction) are valuable.
*   **Novelty:** The explicit consideration of inverse kinematics for agent-centric state learning *in* the POMDP setting appears to be novel. The idea of using a forward-backward sequence model to handle past and future observations is a valuable contribution.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Discussion of Existing POMDP Methods:** While the paper cites some relevant POMDP literature, the discussion of how the proposed approach compares to established POMDP techniques (e.g., belief state maintenance, recurrent policy optimization) is limited.  The paper should more clearly articulate the scenarios where MIK+A is expected to outperform or be complementary to these existing methods. In what kind of POMDP's should the current approach be more suitable than other more standard approches.
*   **Assumptions:** The past and future decodability assumptions are strong.  The paper should more explicitly discuss the limitations imposed by these assumptions and potential ways to relax them. What happens when those assumptions are violated.
*   **"Local Regret" Connection:** While the paper doesn't explicitly discuss how *minimizing local regret* will lead to a better agent-centric state representation, some implicit connections can be explored. What can be said on the relationship between the proposed methodology and "local regret"?
*   **Clarity and Organization:** Some sections (particularly in the experimental setup) could be more clearly written and organized. The sheer number of ablations makes it difficult to digest all the results. A more concise presentation would improve readability.

**Specific Comments and Suggestions:**

*   **Abstract:** The abstract could be more concise and highlight the key theoretical and empirical findings more prominently.
*   **Introduction:** The introduction should more explicitly state the limitations of existing state abstraction methods for POMDPs and how this work addresses those limitations.
*   **Background:** The background section should include a more thorough discussion of existing POMDP techniques, such as belief state maintenance and recurrent policy optimization.  How does the proposed approach relate to these techniques? Under which conditions would each approach be most appropriate?
*   **Theoretical Analysis:**
    *   The assumptions of deterministic agent-centric dynamics and bounded diameter should be justified more clearly.  What are the consequences of violating these assumptions?
    *   The proofs in the appendix are generally clear, but some steps could be explained in more detail.
*   **Experimental Results:**
    *   The experimental setup for the offline RL tasks should be described in more detail, including the hyperparameter settings for the TD3+BC algorithm.
    *   The paper should provide a more detailed analysis of the learned representations.  Are the learned representations interpretable? How do they compare to representations learned by other methods?
    *   Include visualizations of the learned latent spaces to support claims about state recovery.
    *   Consider showing policy performance in the navigation tasks *after* learning representations using the different objectives. This would more directly demonstrate the utility of the learned representations for downstream control.
*   **Related Work:** The related work section should more clearly distinguish this work from existing methods for learning state representations in POMDPs, including methods that use recurrent neural networks or other sequence models.
*   **Future Work:** The conclusion should reiterate the limitations of the proposed approach and suggest directions for future research, such as developing online algorithms that learn decodability properties.

**Minor Comments:**

*   Typos: The paper contains a few minor typos (e.g., "corpuses" should be "corpora").
*   Figure References: Ensure all figures are referenced in the text.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend this paper for acceptance, contingent on addressing the weaknesses and suggestions outlined above. The paper makes a valuable contribution to the problem of learning agent-centric state representations in POMDPs, and the theoretical analysis and empirical results are compelling. Addressing the comments above will strengthen the paper and make it more accessible to a wider audience.
