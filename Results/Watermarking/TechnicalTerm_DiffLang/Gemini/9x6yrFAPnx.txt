## Review of "Provably Efficient CVaR RL in Low-Rank MDPs"

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) by developing a provably efficient algorithm, ELA, for maximizing the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) in low-rank Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The paper tackles a challenging problem, extending existing tabular CVaR RL algorithms to more practical settings with large state spaces through the use of function approximation. The algorithm is well-motivated, technically sound, and the theoretical guarantees are clearly stated and analyzed. Furthermore, the authors address the computational limitations of the initial algorithm by proposing ELLA, a computationally efficient variant based on Least-Squares Value Iteration (LSVI) with discretized rewards. This enhancement strengthens the practicality of the proposed method. The paper is well-written and contributes meaningfully to the theoretical understanding of risk-sensitive RL in complex environments.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** This is, according to the authors' knowledge, the first provably efficient algorithm for CVaR RL in low-rank MDPs. This significantly extends the applicability of CVaR RL beyond the limitations of tabular settings. The work addresses a key gap in the literature by exploring the intersection of risk-averse RL and low-rank MDPs.
*   **Theoretical Rigor:** The paper provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis, including regret bounds and sample complexity guarantees for the ELA algorithm. The PAC bound is explicitly derived and the theorem clearly states the dependence of the sample complexity on relevant parameters like episode length, action space size, representation dimension, and risk tolerance.
*   **Practical Considerations:** The development of ELLA, the computationally efficient planning oracle based on LSVI, addresses a significant practical concern.  The paper demonstrates that near-optimal policies can be found with polynomial running time, which is crucial for real-world applications.
*   **Clear Writing:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it relatively easy to follow the technical details. The introduction clearly states the problem, motivation, and contributions. The Related Work section provides a good overview of relevant prior research.
*   **Well-Defined Algorithm:** The pseudo-code for ELA is clearly presented, and the steps of the algorithm are well-explained. The data collection method, representation learning, and bonus-driven value iteration are all thoroughly described.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Dependency on *H***: The sample complexity's dependency on H<sup>7</sup> is a potential concern. While the authors acknowledge this and suggest potential improvements with reward normalization and Bernstein-type bonuses, it remains a limitation of the current analysis.
*   **Lack of Experimental Validation:** The paper focuses heavily on theoretical contributions. The absence of experimental results demonstrating the performance of ELA or ELLA in practical settings is a notable weakness. Empirical validation would significantly strengthen the paper's impact and demonstrate the real-world applicability of the proposed algorithms.
*   **Tightening the Dependency on τ**: The authors admit that the dependency on τ is loose compared to the lower bounds in CVaR RL. This point requires further future research.

**Specific Comments and Suggestions:**

*   **Experimental Validation:** It is highly recommended to include experimental results in future work. Comparing the performance of ELA/ELLA with existing risk-neutral RL algorithms and potentially other risk-sensitive approaches (even without theoretical guarantees in the same setting) would provide valuable insights.
*   **Bernstein-type Bonus:** Exploring the use of a Bernstein-type bonus in future research, as suggested in the paper, could potentially reduce the dependency on *H* and improve the overall sample complexity.
*   **Discussion of Realizability:** While the paper mentions the realizability assumption (Assumption 3.2), a more in-depth discussion about its implications and the challenges of satisfying this assumption in practice would be beneficial.
*   **Clarity on Discretization:** The discretization process in Appendix B could benefit from further clarification. The rationale for choosing a particular discretization precision υ and its impact on the approximation error should be discussed more thoroughly.
*   **"Label Recovery"**: There is no mention of the term "Label recovery" in the paper.

**Conclusion:**

Despite some minor weaknesses, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of risk-sensitive RL. The proposed algorithms, ELA and ELLA, are theoretically sound and address a crucial gap in the literature by extending CVaR RL to low-rank MDPs with function approximation.  The theoretical guarantees are clearly stated and analyzed, and the computational efficiency of ELLA makes it a promising approach for practical applications.  The lack of experimental validation is a key area for future work, but the paper's theoretical contributions are substantial enough to warrant acceptance at a high-quality conference like ICLR.
