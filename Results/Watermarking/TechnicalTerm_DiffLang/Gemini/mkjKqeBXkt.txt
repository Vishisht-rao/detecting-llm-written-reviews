## Review of "KITS: Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging with Increment Training Strategy"

This paper addresses the important problem of inductive spatio-temporal kriging, where the goal is to estimate values at unobserved locations using sparsely deployed sensors, and crucially, the model must generalize to new unobserved locations not seen during training. The paper identifies a key weakness in existing approaches that rely on a "Decrement training strategy" – the "graph gap" – where the training graph is significantly sparser than the inference graph, hindering generalization.

The authors propose a novel "Increment training strategy" to address this gap by adding "virtual nodes" to the training graph, mimicking the unobserved nodes expected during inference.  To overcome the challenges introduced by these label-less virtual nodes (fitting issues: underfitting and overfitting), they introduce a "Reference-based Feature Fusion" (RFF) module and a "Node-aware Cycle Regulation" (NCR) technique. The proposed model, KITS, is evaluated extensively across eight diverse datasets and demonstrates significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art kriging methods.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clearly Identified Problem and Motivation:** The paper articulates the "graph gap" problem in existing kriging methods very clearly and convincingly. The illustrations in Figure 1 are particularly helpful. The motivation for the "Increment training strategy" is well-justified. The paper tackles model adaptation to changing data, a core challenge in deploying models in dynamic environments.
*   **Novel Increment Training Strategy:** The core idea of the increment training strategy is original and addresses a fundamental limitation in the existing approaches. The approach to virtually generate training data to mimic the real test data makes sense.
*   **Well-Designed Modules (RFF and NCR):** The proposed RFF and NCR modules are cleverly designed to address the challenges introduced by the virtual nodes. The rationale behind fusing features based on similarity and using cycle consistency is sound.
*   **Extensive Experiments and Results:** The paper presents a comprehensive experimental evaluation across eight datasets spanning different domains (traffic, air quality, solar power). The consistent performance improvements over various baselines, both inductive and transductive, are compelling. The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the contribution of each module.
*   **Thorough Ablation Studies:** The component-wise ablation study and studies on different methods of node insertion helps the reader understand the impact of the components added to the model.
*   **Comprehensive Discussion of Experimental Setups:** Implementation details for reproducibility is important in academic research and is present in the paper.
*   **Clear and well-organized paper:** The overall structure and writing quality are very good, making the paper easy to follow. The figures and tables are well-designed and informative.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Reliance on Missing Ratio α:** The method relies on an estimate of the missing ratio α, the proportion of unobserved nodes. While the authors acknowledge this assumption and add a random noise to alpha, the performance of the model may be affected in situations when the true estimate of alpha is not properly known. Furthermore, the model may require tuning when adapting to datasets with different missing patterns.
*   **Increased Training Cost:** A known limitation of the work that is acknowledged in Section I is that additional computing costs are required to insert virtual training data.
*   **Limited Discussion of Computational Complexity:** While the paper mentions the increased training cost in the Appendix, a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of KITS compared to the baselines would be valuable. How does the runtime scale with the number of nodes, the number of virtual nodes, and the size of the graph?
*   **Region Missing Performance:** The authors acknowledge the weaker performance in the "Region Missing" scenario. Further investigation into why KITS struggles in this case and potential strategies to improve its robustness would be beneficial. Are there specific topological characteristics of "Region Missing" graphs that pose a challenge?

**Questions for the Authors:**

*   How sensitive is the performance of KITS to the accuracy of the missing ratio estimate α? Could you provide a sensitivity analysis showing how the performance degrades as the estimated α deviates from the true α?
*   Could you provide a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of KITS compared to the baselines?
*   What specific challenges does the "Region Missing" scenario pose for KITS, and what strategies are you exploring to improve its robustness in this setting?
*   The success of RFF relies on identifying "similar" observed nodes.  How does the definition of similarity impact performance, and are there alternative similarity metrics you've explored?

**Overall Recommendation:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach to inductive spatio-temporal kriging. The "Increment training strategy" is a significant contribution, and the extensive experimental results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of KITS over existing methods.  The paper is well-written and clearly explains the problem, the proposed solution, and the experimental evaluation. Despite the identified weaknesses, the strengths of this paper outweigh the limitations. I **recommend acceptance** with the suggestion that the authors address the questions and consider expanding on the points raised above. The work tackles **model adaptation to changing data** with well engineered techniques.
