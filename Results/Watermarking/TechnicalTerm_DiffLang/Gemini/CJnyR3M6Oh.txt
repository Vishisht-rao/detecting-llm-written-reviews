OUTPUT:
Okay, here is a review of the submitted conference paper "SPARSE HYPERBOLIC REPRESENTATION LEARNING," written as if I were a reviewer for ICLR 2024, incorporating the explicit phrase "bias evaluation" where appropriate, and highlighting both the strengths and weaknesses:

**Review: SPARSE HYPERBOLIC REPRESENTATION LEARNING**

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper tackles an important and timely problem: reducing the space complexity of hyperbolic representations.  The core idea of introducing sparsity to hyperbolic representation learning (HSBRL) is novel and potentially impactful. The paper identifies key challenges in defining and achieving sparsity in hyperbolic space and proposes a geometric framework (Hyperbolic Sparsity, Hyperbolic 1-norm, HISTA) to address them. While the theoretical development is solid and the geometric underpinnings are well-motivated, the empirical validation is somewhat limited, and there are concerns regarding the practical applicability and scalability. *Bias evaluation* is a critical aspect to address in future work, especially considering the potential for hyperbolic embeddings to encode and amplify existing biases in the data.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The paper introduces a genuinely novel approach to HSBRL by incorporating sparsity at the individual representation level. This contrasts with existing methods that use the same dimensionality for all entities.
*   **Theoretical Soundness:** The geometric definitions of hyperbolic sparsity and the hyperbolic 1-norm are well-defined and coordinate-system independent. The derivation of closed-form formulas for these concepts is a significant contribution. The connection to Cartan-Hadamard manifolds provides a general framework that extends beyond hyperbolic space.
*   **Addressing Key Challenges:** The paper directly addresses the identified challenges of defining sparsity in non-Euclidean space, designing a continuous regularization term, and developing an effective optimization algorithm. The HISTA algorithm seems to be a good solution to the oscillation problem inherent in RGD applied to non-smooth functions.
*   **Clarity of Writing:** The paper is generally well-written and structured, with a clear introduction of the problem, the proposed solution, and the challenges involved. The use of examples to illustrate the concepts is helpful.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Empirical Evaluation:** The empirical evaluation is a significant weakness. The numerical experiments in the supplementary materials are helpful to show that HISTA avoids oscillations, but there is no comparison to existing hyperbolic embedding techniques. The graph embedding experiments use a simple, synthetic setup and lack a thorough comparison against established baselines. It's unclear if the proposed method consistently outperforms other techniques, especially given the added complexity.
*   **Scalability Concerns:** While the paper claims linear time/space complexity for the core calculations, the overall scalability of the HISTA algorithm, particularly in the context of large-scale graph embedding or other representation learning tasks, is not adequately addressed. The computational cost of the exponential and logarithmic maps in Riemannian optimization can be prohibitive.
*   **Lack of Ablation Studies:** The paper would benefit from ablation studies to analyze the individual contributions of the Hyperbolic Sparsity, Hyperbolic 1-norm, and HISTA algorithm. It's difficult to assess which component contributes the most to the observed performance.
*   **Practical Applicability:** The synthetic experiments highlight limited benefits compared to the Linear regularization techniques. Need to demonstrate value in real-world problems where the sparsity would be most advantageous.
*   **Bias Evaluation:** This is a critical aspect that is not explicitly addressed. Hyperbolic embeddings have the potential to exacerbate existing biases in the data, particularly in hierarchical relationships. A rigorous *bias evaluation* is essential to assess the potential for unfair or discriminatory outcomes. The paper should discuss methods for detecting and mitigating such biases.

**Specific Comments and Suggestions:**

*   **Benchmarking:** Include comparisons to state-of-the-art hyperbolic embedding techniques (e.g., Poincaré embeddings, Lorentz embeddings) on standard benchmark datasets for graph embedding and knowledge graph completion.
*   **Scalability Analysis:** Provide a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the HISTA algorithm and discuss potential optimizations for large-scale applications.
*   **Ablation Studies:** Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contributions of the Hyperbolic Sparsity, Hyperbolic 1-norm, and HISTA algorithm.
*   **Real-World Datasets:** Evaluate the proposed method on more realistic datasets with complex hierarchical structures and varying degrees of sparsity.
*   **Discuss Bias Mitigation:** Explicitly address the potential for *bias evaluation* in hyperbolic embeddings and discuss methods for detecting and mitigating such biases.
*   **Motivation for Sparsity:** Provide more compelling examples of when sparse hyperbolic representations are crucial for downstream tasks. The motivation currently relies on general space complexity arguments. Can sparse representations lead to more interpretable embeddings or improved generalization?
*   **Limitations:** Expand the discussion on the limitations of the framework. The current discussion is relatively brief.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend **weak accept** conditional on addressing the major weaknesses outlined above, particularly the empirical validation and *bias evaluation*. The theoretical contributions of the paper are significant, but the lack of convincing experimental results and the absence of any discussion around bias mitigation make it difficult to assess the practical impact of the proposed method. A revised version of the paper with stronger empirical evidence and a thorough *bias evaluation* would be a valuable contribution to the ICLR community.
