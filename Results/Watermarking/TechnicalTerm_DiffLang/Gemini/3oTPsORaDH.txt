## Review of "SEGNO: Generalizing Equivariant Graph Neural Networks with Physical Inductive Biases"

**Overall Impression:**

This paper presents a compelling approach, SEGNO, for improving the generalization ability of equivariant GNNs in modeling physical systems. The key idea is to incorporate two important physical inductive biases that are often overlooked: the continuity of transitions between system states and the influence of second-order motion laws. By leveraging Neural ODEs and second-order motion equations, SEGNO learns a unique, continuous trajectory between adjacent states, leading to better generalization. The paper provides theoretical justification for the approach and demonstrates significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on various complex dynamical systems. Overall, the paper is well-written, technically sound, and makes a valuable contribution to the field.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Problem Definition:** The paper clearly identifies the limitations of existing equivariant GNNs in terms of generalization ability due to the lack of physical inductive biases.
*   **Novel Approach:** SEGNO provides a novel and effective solution by combining Neural ODEs with equivariant GNNs to model continuous trajectories and incorporate second-order motion laws.
*   **Strong Theoretical Foundation:** The paper offers theoretical insights into the uniqueness of the learned trajectory and provides an upper bound on the discrepancy between the learned and the actual trajectory.  It leverages established theoretical results like Picard's existence theorem and extends existing theoretical findings on Neural ODEs to the second-order case.
*   **Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation:**  The paper presents extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including N-body systems, molecular dynamics simulations (MD22), and motion capture data (CMU).  The results consistently demonstrate the superiority of SEGNO over strong baselines. Ablation studies further validate the importance of the proposed inductive biases.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written, with a clear structure and logical flow. The figures and tables are informative and contribute to the understanding of the proposed method.
*   **Reproducibility**: Sharing some of the code or having public code would help in the reproducibility of the paper.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Computational Cost:** While the paper reports competitive runtime in some settings, a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of SEGNO compared to simpler discrete models, particularly concerning the ODE solver, would be beneficial.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:**  The paper mentions searching for the optimal iteration time (τ) for SEGNO. A discussion of the sensitivity of performance to this parameter and potential strategies for selecting it would be helpful.
*   **Limitations of the Theoretical Analysis:** The theoretical analysis relies on assumptions such as Lipschitz continuity and the analyticity and boundedness of the functions.  A discussion of the limitations of these assumptions and their potential impact on the theoretical guarantees would strengthen the paper.

**Specific Comments and Suggestions:**

*   **Figure 1:**  The figure effectively illustrates the advantages of incorporating continuity and second-order laws.  However, adding labels to the axes (e.g., "Time") could further enhance its clarity.
*   **Equation 12:** The notation "s ∈ Dtrain" could be made clearer. Explicitly mentioning that 's' represents a specific trajectory within the training dataset would be helpful.
*   **Section 5.1.1 (Ablation Study):**  Providing a brief explanation of *how* the "Discrete" variants were implemented would be valuable.  Was it simply not sharing parameters across iterations?
*   **Appendix:** The detailed proofs in the appendix are valuable, but could benefit from more descriptive section titles to improve navigation.

**Missing Information:**
* The paper would benefit from including the concept of **constant fan-in** or the citation of an article that mentions the specific term or concept. While the concepts are included they aren't specifically called that.

**Overall Recommendation:**

I recommend this paper for acceptance. The proposed method, SEGNO, addresses a critical limitation in existing equivariant GNNs and demonstrates significant improvements in generalization ability. The theoretical analysis provides a solid foundation for the approach, and the comprehensive experimental evaluation provides strong empirical support. The paper makes a valuable contribution to the field and is likely to be of interest to the ICLR community. While there are some minor weaknesses, they do not detract significantly from the overall quality of the paper. I encourage the authors to address the specific comments and suggestions outlined above to further improve the presentation and clarity of their work.
