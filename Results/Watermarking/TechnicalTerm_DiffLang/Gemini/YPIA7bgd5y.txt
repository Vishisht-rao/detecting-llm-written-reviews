## Review of "In-Context Learning Learns Label Relationships But Is Not Conventional Learning"

This paper investigates the intriguing capabilities and limitations of in-context learning (ICL) in Large Language Models (LLMs) regarding label relationships. The authors present a compelling argument that while ICL *does* learn from in-context labels, it does so in a manner distinct from idealized conventional learning algorithms. This provides a valuable nuanced perspective on the ongoing debate about the nature of ICL. The paper is well-structured, clearly articulated, and supported by thorough empirical evidence.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clearly Defined Research Questions and Hypotheses:** The paper formulates specific null hypotheses (NH1, NH2, NH3) based on intuitive properties of conventional learning, making the investigation rigorous and focused.
*   **Comprehensive Empirical Evaluation:** The paper presents a wide range of experiments across multiple LLMs (LLaMa-2, LLaMa, Falcon), datasets (SST-2, Subj., FP, HS, AGN, MQP, MRPC, RTE, WNLI), and metrics (accuracy, log likelihood, entropy). The inclusion of full ICL training curves, rather than just fixed few-shot sizes, is a significant strength.
*   **Probabilistic Analysis:**  The use of probabilistic metrics like log likelihood and entropy provides richer insights into ICL behavior than relying solely on accuracy. This is particularly evident in the label randomization experiments.
*   **Novel Evaluation Strategy:** The proposed computationally cheap ICL evaluation strategy (described in Section B) is a valuable contribution, allowing for efficient exploration of ICL training dynamics.
*   **Novel Task:** The authorship identification task using private messages guarantees a task unseen in the pre-training data, strengthening the argument that ICL can learn truly novel label relationships.
*   **Addressing Prior Work:**  The paper directly addresses and critiques the claims of previous work, particularly Min et al. (2022b), clarifying discrepancies in findings and highlighting the importance of probabilistic metrics.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is clearly written and well-organized, making it easy to follow the logic and understand the results.
*   **Relevance to Alignment:** The discussion about the implications for LLM alignment is pertinent and highlights the practical significance of the findings.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Scope of Tasks:** The paper primarily focuses on classification tasks using logits, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings to free-form generation tasks or other NLP tasks like question answering, where label influence might be different. The authors acknowledge this limitation, but further discussion on potential differences would be beneficial.
*   **Lack of RLHF-finetuned LLMs:**  The paper's limitation in excluding RLHF-finetuned models weakens its application to modern LLMs like ChatGPT. A discussion of how RLHF might alter ICL's label learning behavior is important.
*   **Oversimplification of "Conventional Learning":** While the concept of a "conventional learning algorithm" is useful for framing the hypotheses, it could be argued that it presents an overly simplistic view of modern machine learning, which often incorporates biases and limitations that deviate from the idealized learner.
*  **Machine Learning for Combinatorial Optimization Missing:** The paper does not seem to mention Machine Learning for Combinatorial Optimization, which might be related to the in-context learning problems.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Discussion on Free-Form Generation:** Elaborate on potential challenges and differences in label learning in free-form generation tasks. Explore if the conclusions are expected to hold or if ICL behavior might differ significantly.
*   **Speculation on RLHF Impact:** Dedicate a paragraph or two to speculating on how RLHF might impact ICL's label learning capabilities, particularly in terms of overriding pre-training preferences.
*   **More Nuanced Definition of Conventional Learning:** Acknowledge the inherent limitations and biases present in real-world machine learning algorithms, even with perfect training. How do these imperfections relate to the observed limitations of ICL?
*   **Explore the term "Machine Learning for Combinatorial Optimization"** The paper should discuss existing literature where the phrase "Machine Learning for Combinatorial Optimization" is explicitly present to connect to research in that field.

**Overall:**

This is a strong and valuable contribution to the understanding of in-context learning in LLMs. The authors present a well-designed and executed study that provides significant insights into the capabilities and limitations of ICL in learning from label relationships. Despite the minor weaknesses mentioned above, this paper is highly recommended for acceptance.
