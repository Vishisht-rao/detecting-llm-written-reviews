**Review: Towards a Self-Made Model: Zero-Shot Self-Supervised Purification for Adversarial Attacks**

**Summary:**

This paper proposes a novel zero-shot, self-supervised adversarial purification method called ZeroPur.  The core idea is to leverage the natural image manifold hypothesis and iteratively refine adversarial examples back onto this manifold without requiring a generative model or retraining the classifier.  ZeroPur employs a two-stage approach: coarse shifting (using blurring as a reference) followed by fine alignment (maximizing intermediate-level discrepancies). The authors demonstrate through experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet that ZeroPur achieves competitive or superior robust performance compared to existing adversarial training and purification methods, particularly those that do not rely on generative models or classifier retraining.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The proposed ZeroPur method presents a unique approach to adversarial purification. The idea of using blurring as a coarse shifting mechanism and intermediate layer discrepancies for fine alignment is interesting and potentially impactful.  The elimination of the need for a pre-trained generative model or classifier retraining is a significant advantage.

*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and explains the motivation, methodology, and experimental setup clearly. The figures, especially Figure 1, are helpful in visualizing the proposed approach. The connection to the natural image manifold hypothesis is well-articulated.

*   **Experimental Results:** The experimental results are comprehensive and convincing.  The authors compare against a wide range of state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets and demonstrate strong robust performance, especially in the *l*<sub>∞</sub> threat model. The ablation studies, such as those discussing the impact of blurring operators, provide valuable insights.

*   **Zero-Shot Advantage:** The "zero-shot" nature of the approach is a major selling point, as it offers a more practical defense against unseen attacks compared to adversarial training which tends to overfit to specific attack types used during training.

* **Connections to existing work:** The paper provides a reasonably comprehensive overview of related work in adversarial training and adversarial purification.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Adaptive Attack Vulnerability:** The paper acknowledges a vulnerability to strong adaptive attacks like BPDA+EOT.  While some performance is maintained, the drop in robustness with increasing purification steps is concerning. The explanation that BPDA+EOT can better estimate gradients with more steps makes sense, but it highlights a limitation.  The justification that these attacks may underestimate the true robustness of ZeroPur requires further strengthening. More analysis is needed on *why* ZeroPur is susceptible to these attacks despite its other strengths.  Are there specific properties of the learned features or the optimization process that make it easier to exploit?

*   **Natural Image Degradation:** The degradation of performance on clean natural images is a significant weakness. While this is acknowledged in the limitations section, the magnitude of the drop in accuracy on ImageNet (Table 10) is substantial and raises concerns about the practical applicability of ZeroPur as a general-purpose defense. Addressing this is critical. Borrowing test-time adaptation (TTA) is a good idea, but further elaboration or preliminary results in this direction would greatly improve the paper.

*   **Blurring Operator Sensitivity:** The performance seems to be sensitive to the choice of the blurring operator (Table 9). While the authors provide some discussion, a more principled approach to selecting the blurring operator or a mechanism for adaptively choosing it based on the input image would be beneficial.

*   **Lack of theoretical analysis**: The paper is mostly empirical and lacks theoretical justification on how the proposed method can provably defend against adversarial attacks.

* **Dynamic Scene Decomposition Citation**: The paper needs to cite the term "dynamic scene decomposition".

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Adaptive Attacks:** Investigate further why ZeroPur is susceptible to adaptive attacks. Explore potential mitigation strategies, perhaps by incorporating techniques to detect or counteract gradient obfuscation.

*   **Natural Image Performance:** Focus on improving performance on clean natural images. Explore TTA techniques more deeply. Perhaps a pre-processing step to determine if an image is adversarial could be used to selectively apply ZeroPur.

*   **Blurring Operator Selection:** Develop a more robust or adaptive method for selecting the blurring operator.  Could the blurring parameters be learned or optimized during training of the base classifier?

*   **Theoretical Foundation:** Provide theoretical analysis to justify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

*   **Closer tie to previous work:** More discussion on how the ideas in ZeroPur relate to other techniques in image denoising or inpainting could be beneficial.

**Overall Assessment:**

This is a promising paper that introduces a novel and effective zero-shot self-supervised adversarial purification method. The experimental results are strong, and the idea of leveraging the natural image manifold hypothesis is compelling. However, the vulnerability to adaptive attacks and the degradation of performance on clean natural images are significant weaknesses that need to be addressed.  With further work on these areas, this paper could make a significant contribution to the field of adversarial defense.

**Recommendation:**

Weak Accept. The paper has enough merit and novelty to be considered for acceptance. However, addressing the weaknesses mentioned above is crucial for improving the paper's impact and practical applicability.
