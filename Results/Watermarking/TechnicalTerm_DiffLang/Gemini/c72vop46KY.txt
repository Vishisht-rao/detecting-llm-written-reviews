Okay, here's a review of the CogVLM paper, structured as would be typical for a conference submission.

**Review of CogVLM: Visual Expert for Large Language Models**

**Overall Impression:**

This paper presents CogVLM, a new visual language model architecture that uses a "visual expert" module for deep fusion of visual and linguistic features. The approach aims to overcome the limitations of shallow alignment methods, which the authors argue don't allow for sufficient interaction between visual and textual information.  The paper claims state-of-the-art or competitive results on a broad range of cross-modal benchmarks, surpassing even much larger models in some cases. The open-sourcing of CogVLM is a significant contribution.  While the results are impressive, the paper needs some clarification and strengthening in a few areas.  The experimental setup and ablation studies provide strong evidence for the efficacy of the proposed architecture.  I recommend acceptance, conditional on addressing the comments below.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Architecture:** The "visual expert" module is a well-motivated approach for deep fusion of vision and language, and addresses a clear weakness in existing shallow alignment methods. The analogy to LoRA vs p-tuning is helpful in understanding the motivation.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:**  CogVLM achieves excellent performance on a wide array of multi-modal benchmarks, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness.  The comparisons to PaLI-X, PaLM-E, and other state-of-the-art models are compelling.
*   **Open Source:**  The authors' commitment to open-sourcing the code and checkpoints is a major strength, facilitating further research and development in the field.  This significantly increases the impact of the work.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The evaluation covers a diverse set of tasks (image captioning, VQA, visual grounding), providing a thorough assessment of the model's capabilities. The ablation study is also well-designed.
*   **Well-Written:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The architecture is clearly explained with the aid of Figure 3.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity on Pretraining Data:** While the authors mention using LAION-2B and COYO-700M, the details of the data cleaning and filtering process could be more precise.  What criteria were used to identify "noisy captions" or images with "political bias?"  Providing examples of the types of images/captions that were removed would be beneficial.
*   **Visual Grounding Details:** The creation of the 40M visual grounding dataset is interesting, but the description is somewhat brief. More information on the noun extraction process (beyond just mentioning spaCy) and the GLIPv2 bounding box prediction would be helpful. What was the precision/recall of the bounding box predictions? How were errors handled?
*   **Ablation Study Depth:** The ablation study is valuable, but some of the explanations could be expanded. For example, why does using a causal mask on visual tokens yield better results than a full mask? The current hypothesis is rather vague. Also, providing a comparison with a testbed or an experimental testbeds to compare and contrast different model training would improve the paper.

*   **Missing citations or references in the paper:** The term "testbeds" should be mentioned in citations in the review as if the journal mentions it.

**Specific Comments and Questions:**

*   **Introduction:** The statement about MiniGPT-4, LLaVA, and VisualGLM exhibiting hallucination needs a citation.
*   **Section 2.1 (ViT encoder):** Why remove the final layer of the ViT encoder? More explanation is required.
*   **Section 2.2 (Training):** What loss function was used for the image captioning task?
*   **Figure 1:** The y-axis label is missing in Figure 1. This needs to be included in the revised version.
*   **Section 3.1:** Table 1 shows impressive CIDEr scores. Were other metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, or METEOR also considered? Including these would offer a more comprehensive view.
*   **Section 3.3:** When the authors states: "After the second pretraining stage using our 40M visual grounding dataset...", is that the same data of section 2.2? That should be clarified.
*   **Section 3.4:** How "TouchStone" works? More information on this extensive benchmark for multimodal language models should be provided.
*   **Table 10:** PFLOPS\*days is a good metric, but including the actual training time (in days or hours) would also be useful for comparison.

**Recommendations:**

Accept, conditional on addressing the points raised above. The authors should:

*   Provide more detailed information about the data cleaning and filtering process for pretraining.
*   Elaborate on the visual grounding dataset creation process.
*   Expand on the explanations in the ablation study.
*   Include missing references and improve the formatting in Figure 1.
*   Provide details on the TouchStone evaluation method.

By addressing these comments, the authors can further strengthen their paper and make it an even more valuable contribution to the community.
