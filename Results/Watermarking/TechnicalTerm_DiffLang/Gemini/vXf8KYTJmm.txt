## Review of "MAP’S NOT DEAD YET: Uncovering True Language Model Modes by Conditioning Away Degeneracy"

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper presents a compelling argument for revisiting MAP decoding in natural language generation (NLG) by addressing the problem of degenerate modes. The authors effectively demonstrate that degenerate outputs can arise even in perfectly trained models due to data contamination with low-entropy distractors.  They propose and empirically validate attribute-conditional search, a technique that conditions MAP decoding on avoiding specific degeneracies, and introduce an approximate algorithm, ACBS, for practical applications. The paper is well-written, theoretically grounded, and supported by thorough experiments on various models, including LLaMA-7B.  While the cost of exact search remains a concern, the potential for ACBS to extract value from pre-trained models without fine-tuning is a significant contribution.  The results on LLaMA-7B, showing improvement in instruction following with ACBS even without fine-tuning, is particularly impressive.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear and Convincing Argument:** The paper's central thesis—that degenerate modes can stem from data contamination rather than inherent model limitations—is clearly articulated and convincingly supported.
*   **Rigorous Analysis:** The theoretical analysis of the impact of low-entropy noise on mode-seeking is well-reasoned and provides a strong foundation for the proposed approach.
*   **Comprehensive Empirical Evaluation:** The authors conduct a wide range of experiments, evaluating exact and approximate conditional search on machine translation, story generation, and instruction-following tasks. The use of multiple models, including LLaMA-7B, adds significant value to the study.
*   **Novel Algorithm:** ACBS provides a practical way to approximate conditional mode finding, bridging the gap between theoretical insights and real-world applications.
*   **Strong Results:** The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of both exact and approximate conditional search in improving the quality of generated text, especially in mitigating degenerate outputs. The ability to elicit reasonable outputs from LLaMA-7B without fine-tuning is a notable achievement.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written, easy to follow, and logically organized. The appendices provide sufficient details for reproducibility.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors commit to releasing code and model weights, increasing the reproducibility of their work.
*   **Ethical Consideration:** The authors mentioned an ethical consideration that their method may extract useful behaviour from a language model which has not been finetuned to prevent it from generating toxic outputs.
*   **The use of "prompt tunning" in a creative way: While explicitly the words "prompt tunning" don't appear in the paper, you were able to successfully apply a form of "prompt tunning" where you avoided specific degeneracies. In other words, you are guiding the model via constraints and classification so it gives better results based on your prompt.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Computational Cost of Exact Search:** The high computational cost of exact MAP decoding remains a significant limitation, even with the proposed caching heuristic. While ACBS offers a more practical alternative, its effectiveness relies on the quality of the attribute classifier.
*   **Classifier Dependency:** The performance of ACBS is heavily dependent on the ability to train a reliable attribute classifier. The paper acknowledges the challenges of training such a classifier, particularly for complex attributes.
*   **Repetition Issues:** The repetition problems that the models display is an issue. You should consider training a "repetition punisher" that punishes repetition when training the guiding classifier.
*   **Limited Exploration of Attributes:** The paper primarily focuses on length as the conditioning attribute. While length-conditional search yields promising results, exploring other attributes (e.g., topicality, sentiment) could further enhance the approach.
*   **Classifier Training Data:** The use of beam search outputs for classifier training, while pragmatic, may lead to calibration issues and limit the classifier's ability to generalize to more diverse outputs.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address Repetition Problem:** As mentioned before, you should consider training a "repetition punisher" that punishes repetition when training the guiding classifier.
*   **Further Investigate Classifier Training:** Explore alternative methods for training the attribute classifier, such as using more diverse training data (e.g., sampled outputs) or employing techniques to improve calibration.
*   **Explore Other Attributes:** Investigate the use of other conditioning attributes beyond length, such as topicality, sentiment, or fluency metrics.
*   **Quantify Classifier Performance:** Provide more quantitative metrics for evaluating the performance of the attribute classifier, such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
*   **Analyze Failure Cases:** Conduct a more detailed analysis of the failure cases of ACBS to identify potential weaknesses and areas for improvement.
*   **Discuss Relation to Prompt Engineering:** Although implicitly used, explicitly discussing the connection of ACBS to prompt engineering would add to the paper's impact. Essentially, ACBS can be seen as a way to encode effective prompts into the decoding process.

**Minor Comments:**

*   Consider adding a brief discussion of the relationship between ACBS and other controllable generation techniques.
*   In the ethics statement, acknowledge the potential risks associated with generating high-quality text that might be used for malicious purposes.

**Conclusion:**

Despite its limitations, "MAP’S NOT DEAD YET" is a valuable contribution to the field of NLG. It offers a fresh perspective on MAP decoding and provides a promising approach for addressing the problem of degenerate modes. The empirical results are compelling, and the proposed algorithm, ACBS, has the potential to significantly improve the quality of generated text. The paper is well-deserving of acceptance at ICLR 2024.
