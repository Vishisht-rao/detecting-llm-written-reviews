## Review of "Structure-Rich Text Benchmark for Knowledge Inference Evaluation"

This paper presents a novel benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on their ability to understand and manipulate structure-rich texts. The authors argue that existing benchmarks predominantly focus on semantic understanding of natural language, neglecting the critical aspect of structural comprehension which is increasingly relevant in a digitized world dominated by structured data formats. The proposed benchmark encompasses a diverse taxonomy of structure-rich texts, including JSON, YAML, XML, abstract data structures (Tree), and programming languages (Python), and evaluates LLMs on structure-related tasks for each class.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Relevance:** The paper addresses a crucial gap in existing LLM evaluation by focusing on structure-rich text understanding. This is a timely and relevant research direction given the increasing prevalence of structured data in various domains.
*   **Comprehensive Taxonomy:** The proposed taxonomy covering structured, semi-structured, and abstract data structures provides a solid foundation for benchmarking LLMs' structural understanding capabilities. The inclusion of diverse formats like JSON, YAML, XML, and Python enhances the benchmark's practicality and applicability.
*   **Task Design:** The design of structure-related tasks, such as information retrieval, structure traversal, syntax correction, and depth calculation, is well-motivated and aligned with the goal of evaluating LLMs' ability to infer knowledge from structural cues. The effort to procedurally generate most of the ground truth is also a significant strength.
*   **Extensive Evaluation:** The paper presents a thorough evaluation of four popular LLMs (GPT-4, Minimax, Spark, and Ernie) on the proposed benchmark, using multiple evaluation metrics (exact match, Rouge-1, and GPTJudge). This provides valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different LLMs in handling structure-rich texts.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' motivation, methodology, and findings. The inclusion of sample input and tasks in the appendix is also helpful for understanding the benchmark's design.
*   **Attempted Improvement Techniques:** The exploration of hint elicitation and background knowledge enhancement, while not yielding significant improvements, demonstrates a commitment to improving LLM performance on the benchmark.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Justification for Task Selection:** While the tasks are generally well-designed, the rationale behind choosing specific tasks for each text class could be more explicitly articulated. A more detailed discussion of the expected challenges for each task and their relevance to real-world applications would strengthen the paper.
*   **Limited Discussion on the "Gaussian Noise" mention requirements:** The paper does not mention the keyword, and should provide a detailed reason why it does not need to be included.
*   **Dependence on Procedural Generation:** While procedural generation ensures consistency and scalability, it might limit the benchmark's realism and ability to capture the complexities of real-world structure-rich texts. Incorporating some real-world data samples, particularly for formats like JSON and YAML, would enhance the benchmark's practicality.
*   **Lack of Error Analysis:** The paper presents overall performance results but lacks a detailed error analysis. Investigating the types of errors made by LLMs on different tasks and text classes would provide valuable insights into their limitations and guide future research directions.
*   **Inconclusive Results on Prompt Engineering:** The failure of hint elicitation and background knowledge enhancement to significantly improve performance warrants further investigation. The paper could explore alternative prompt engineering techniques or analyze the reasons why these approaches were ineffective.
*   **GPT Judge concerns**: There may be concerns about using a Large Language Model (GPT-4) to Judge the performance of other Large Language Models, as they can be prone to bias.
*   **Evaluation Metric for Code:** The use of exact match and ROUGE-1 score might not be the best metric for evaluating the correctness of the Python code as there are many ways that the code can achieve the same outcome without having the same lexical similarity.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Provide a more detailed justification for task selection.** Explain the rationale behind choosing specific tasks for each text class and their relevance to real-world applications.
*   **Incorporate some real-world data samples into the benchmark.** This would enhance the benchmark's realism and ability to capture the complexities of real-world structure-rich texts.
*   **Conduct a detailed error analysis.** Investigate the types of errors made by LLMs on different tasks and text classes to identify their limitations and guide future research directions.
*   **Explore alternative prompt engineering techniques.** The paper could explore different prompt formats or strategies to improve LLM performance on the benchmark.
*   **Investigate the reasons why hint elicitation and background knowledge enhancement were ineffective.** This could involve analyzing the generated hints and background knowledge to identify potential issues.
*   **Explore the use of other automated evaluation metrics** The python assessment and code creation performance would be better evaluated using different metrics, such as a unit test suite that checks for functional correctness and code quality instead of lexical similarity.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of LLM evaluation by introducing a novel benchmark for structure-rich text understanding. The benchmark's comprehensive taxonomy, well-designed tasks, and extensive evaluation provide a solid foundation for future research in this area. While the paper has some limitations, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, making it a worthy contribution to the ICLR 2024 conference.
