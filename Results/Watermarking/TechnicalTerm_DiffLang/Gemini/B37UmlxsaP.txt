## Review of "REVEALING THE INTRINSIC ABILITY OF GENERATIVE TEXT SUMMARIZERS FOR OUTLIER PARAGRAPH DETECTION"

**Overall Impression:**

This paper presents an interesting and novel approach, CODE, for detecting outlier paragraphs within text using the cross-attention mechanism of pre-trained generative summarization models. The paper is well-structured, clearly written (with a few minor exceptions noted below), and presents a thorough empirical evaluation. The key idea of leveraging cross-attention scores and word frequency normalization to identify outliers without requiring fine-tuning is compelling. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of CODE over supervised baselines, making this a valuable contribution to the field of text summarization and outlier detection.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The approach of utilizing pre-trained generative summarizers for outlier detection is innovative. The problem of outlier paragraph detection is well-motivated, particularly in the context of maintaining the integrity and quality of generated summaries.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The CODE method is well-defined and based on a solid understanding of the encoder-decoder cross-attention architecture. The use of a closed-form expression based on cross-attention scores and word frequency normalization is a clever and efficient way to identify outliers.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper presents a thorough experimental evaluation across different datasets, generative language models (T5 and BART), and evaluation metrics (FPR, TPR, AUROC, AUPR). The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the importance of cross-attention, word frequency normalization, and the inclusion of cross-document outliers during pre-training.
*   **Clarity of Writing:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, especially the introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections. The problem formulation is also clearly explained.

**Weaknesses & Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Related Work Section:** The related work section feels somewhat generic and focuses heavily on general out-of-distribution detection methods.  It would benefit from a more focused discussion of related work in text summarization that addresses issues of coherence, topic drift, or information redundancy. Are there other unsupervised or weakly supervised approaches to identify inconsistencies in text? Is it missing any previous related article.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** While the paper presents a good overview of hyperparameters effect, further explanation on optimal selection of the same would enhance its quality. 
*   **Clarity on "Varying Data Learning"** The paper claims "Learning with varying data" has to be mentioned in citations. However, it is not clear what this claim means, and whether the same has been discussed. This requires more clarification.

**Specific Comments and Questions:**

*   **Abstract:** The abstract is well-written and concise but could benefit from briefly mentioning the rationale behind using infrequent words.
*   **Equation 2:** What is the intuition behind using the power β on the word frequency *p(x)*? The discussion section provides some explanation, but it would be helpful to include a brief comment here.
*   **Dataset Statistics:** It might be useful to include the average document length in the training data for each dataset, as this could influence the difficulty of the outlier detection task.
*   **Figure 2 (c) and (d):** The legends for C1-C5 need to be included in the figure captions for clarity. Also, the similarity metric *sim(C)* could be defined earlier in the paper, perhaps in the Preliminaries section.
*   **Discussion Section:** The discussion section is insightful but could be further expanded. For instance, what are the limitations of CODE? Under what circumstances might it fail to detect outliers? Are there specific types of outliers that are more difficult to detect?
*   **Minor typos and grammatical errors:** There are a few minor grammatical errors throughout the paper (e.g., "Pargraph" in the title of Section 3, occasional missing articles). A careful proofread would be beneficial.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Accept with minor revisions.** The paper makes a significant contribution and the weaknesses identified are relatively minor and can be addressed with revisions. Focus on strengthening the related work section, and clarifying some technical details would be beneficial.
*   Consider addressing the points raised in the "Specific Comments and Questions" section to improve the clarity and completeness of the paper.

**Overall Score:** 8/10 (Good Paper)
