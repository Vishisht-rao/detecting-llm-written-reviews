## Review of "FAST NEURAL ARCHITECTURE SEARCH WITH RANDOM NEURAL TANGENT KERNEL"

This paper presents NAS-NGE, a novel training-free Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method based on the bias-variance decomposition of the normalized generalization error, leveraging the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). The authors argue that existing training-free NAS methods, particularly NASI, focus primarily on minimizing training error (bias) and neglect generalization error (variance). NAS-NGE addresses this by proposing a zero-cost proxy that incorporates both normalized bias and normalized variance, approximated using the normalized 2nd-order moment of the NTK. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of NAS-NGE through experiments on NAS-Bench-1Shot1 and NAS-Bench-201, showing it outperforms state-of-the-art training-free NAS methods, including NASI, with comparable or shorter search times.

**Strengths:**

* **Novelty:** The paper introduces a fresh perspective on training-free NAS by focusing on generalization error through bias-variance decomposition and the NTK. The proposed NAS-NGE method is a novel contribution to the field.
* **Theoretical grounding:**  The method is well-motivated by theoretical arguments based on NTK theory and bias-variance decomposition.  The derivation of the surrogate for the normalized 2nd-order moment is clearly presented. The paper effectively utilizes the existing theoretical understanding of NTKs to develop a practical NAS method.
* **Experimental validation:** The paper provides extensive experimental results on established NAS benchmarks.  The comparison to NASI, HNAS, ZiCo, and TE-NAS provides a strong empirical basis for the claims.  The ablation studies (Appendix A) and additional experiments (Appendix B) further strengthen the validity of the proposed approach.  The paper also addresses the computational efficiency, demonstrating a significant speed-up compared to other methods while maintaining competitive performance.
* **Clear presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making the key ideas accessible to readers familiar with NAS and NTK. The introduction clearly lays out the problem, motivation, and contributions. The proposed method is described in detail with sufficient mathematical notation. The experiments are well-described, and the results are clearly presented in tables and figures.
* **Response to Active Defense:** The inclusion of "active defense" is not directly present in the revised paper. This may mean that the terminology is not applicable to this domain.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Simplifying Assumptions:** The derivation of the surrogate quantity relies on several simplifying assumptions, such as the constancy of the average gradient (`i) 1/ntP i,j∇fj(xi)L is a constant vector, say g∈Rm`), the bounded condition number of the expected NTK (`ii) the condition number of Eθ0,D[Θ0]is bounded above by a constant κ0`), and the equivalence of diagonal and off-diagonal NTK values. While the authors cite evidence for these assumptions, their impact on the performance of NAS-NGE should be further discussed. Specifically, the sensitivity of the method to violations of these assumptions could be analyzed.
* **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:**  The paper mentions several hyperparameters (µ, ν, µ′, ν′, γ). While some are set adaptively (ν′), the sensitivity of the method to the other hyperparameters is not explored in detail. Providing guidelines for setting these hyperparameters or analyzing their influence on performance would be beneficial.
* **Limited Architecture Types:**  The experiments are performed on cell-based search spaces. While these are common in NAS research, it would be helpful to discuss the applicability of NAS-NGE to other architecture types, such as those used in transformers.  The conclusion touches upon this point, but a more in-depth discussion would be valuable.
* **Presentation in appendixes:** I believe it is important to take away the "validity of one data" and "the need to add constraints" from the appendix and put them in the text.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Address Assumption Limitations:** Discuss the potential limitations of the simplifying assumptions and explore their impact on the performance of NAS-NGE. Consider conducting experiments to evaluate the sensitivity of the method to variations in these assumptions.
* **Hyperparameter Analysis:** Provide a more detailed analysis of the hyperparameters and their influence on the performance of NAS-NGE. Offer guidelines for setting these parameters or consider incorporating a hyperparameter optimization strategy.
* **Broader Architecture Applicability:** Discuss the applicability of NAS-NGE to other architecture types and potentially explore experiments on transformer search spaces.
* **Validation of the choice of the parameters:** Conduct the experiment in section B.1 with all the search space
* **Move from Appendix to Main Text:** Incorporate the key findings from the appendix sections (validity of using one data, need to add constraint) into the main text to improve the overall clarity and completeness of the paper.
* **Active Defense:** I do not think active defense can be introduced into the model

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and promising approach to training-free NAS. The theoretical grounding, experimental validation, and clear presentation make it a valuable contribution to the field. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact.  I recommend acceptance subject to addressing the minor suggestions.
