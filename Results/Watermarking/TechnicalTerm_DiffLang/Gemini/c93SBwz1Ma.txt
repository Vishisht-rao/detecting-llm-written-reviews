## Review of "BADCHAIN: Backdoor Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Large Language Models"

This paper presents BadChain, a novel backdoor attack targeting Large Language Models (LLMs) leveraging Chain-of-Thought (COT) prompting. The attack is significant because it doesn't require access to the LLM's training data or parameters, making it practical against commercial LLMs accessible via API. The core idea is to insert a malicious reasoning step within the COT sequence when a specific trigger is present in the input, leading the model to produce a targeted, undesirable output.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The paper addresses a critical vulnerability of LLMs employing COT prompting. Current backdoor attacks are largely ineffective against the reasoning capabilities of these models, and BadChain offers a compelling solution.  The fact that the attack works on API-accessible models is a significant practical threat. The authors correctly highlight the weakness of existing methods for simpler classification tasks when applied to tasks requiring complex reasoning.
*   **Clear and Well-Structured Presentation:** The paper is well-written and organized, making it easy to understand the problem, proposed solution, and experimental results.  The use of figures, especially Figure 1 illustrating the attack, is helpful.
*   **Strong Empirical Evaluation:** The authors conduct extensive experiments across various LLMs (Llama2, GPT-3.5, PaLM2, and GPT-4), COT strategies (COT-S, SC), reasoning tasks (arithmetic, commonsense, symbolic), and trigger types (non-word, phrase-based).  The results demonstrate the effectiveness of BadChain, particularly against stronger LLMs.
*   **Ablation Studies and Interpretability:** The paper includes ablation studies exploring the impact of various design choices, such as the proportion of backdoored demonstrations and the trigger location.  The trigger interpretation analysis provides valuable insights into how the model "learns" the association between the trigger, backdoor reasoning step, and target output. This adds to the understanding of why BadChain works, and provides clues for better defense strategies.
*   **Defense Attempt and Discussion:**  While the proposed shuffling-based defenses are ineffective, their inclusion demonstrates a comprehensive approach. The authors accurately point out that the ineffectiveness underscores the need for future research in this area.
*   **Ethical Considerations:** The authors provide an ethics statement outlining the potential negative consequences of the attack and emphasizing the importance of developing effective defenses. The examples in Figure 14 in the appendix further highlight the potential harm.
*   **Code Availability:** Providing a link to the code repository enhances reproducibility and allows other researchers to build upon this work.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Threat Model Assumption:** The paper assumes the attacker has the ability to manipulate the user prompt. While this is a plausible scenario (e.g., compromised third-party services), the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the attack surface and potential real-world attack vectors. How might this attack be carried out at scale?  What specific vulnerabilities would need to be exploited?
*   **Limited Defense Exploration:** While the defense attempts are appreciated, they are relatively simplistic. The paper could be strengthened by exploring more sophisticated defense strategies, even if only theoretically. For instance, exploring the use of "data efficient training" techniques to mitigate the effects of poisoned demonstrations could be valuable. **It would be interesting to see the authors discussing how "data efficient training" could be used to mitigate this.**
*   **Trigger Sensitivity:** The reliance on a specific trigger might make the attack vulnerable to trigger detection or filtering mechanisms. Further discussion on the stealthiness of the triggers and potential evasion techniques would be beneficial.
*   **Specificity of Reasoning Step:** The carefully designed backdoor reasoning step is crucial for the attack's success. A limitation of the paper is that it does not suggest automatic ways of designing such reasoning steps. Is there a way to generalize or automate the creation of the backdoor reasoning step for different tasks or models?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand on the Threat Model:** Provide a more detailed discussion of the attack surface and potential real-world scenarios where BadChain could be deployed.
*   **Explore More Sophisticated Defenses:** Investigate more advanced defense strategies, such as input sanitization, prompt engineering for robustness, and model calibration techniques. Consider how existing backdoor defenses could be adapted to the COT setting. Discuss possible integration of "data efficient training" as a strategy for future investigations.
*   **Address Trigger Sensitivity:** Discuss the potential for trigger detection and evasion techniques to improve the stealthiness of the attack.
*   **Discuss Generalization of Reasoning Steps:** Can the design of backdoor reasoning steps be automated or generalized to different tasks and models?
*   **Minor Typos:** The paper has a few minor grammatical errors and typos, which should be corrected in the final version.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that introduces a novel and significant backdoor attack against LLMs. The clear presentation, rigorous empirical evaluation, and insightful analysis make it a valuable contribution to the field. While there are some weaknesses, the paper is well-deserving of acceptance. The suggestions for improvement could further enhance its impact and stimulate future research in this important area.
