## Review of "LARGE TRAJECTORY MODELS ARE SCALABLE MOTION PREDICTORS AND PLANNERS"

This paper presents a compelling approach called State Transformer (STR) for motion prediction and planning in autonomous driving. Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), the authors propose a scalable trajectory model that reformulates motion prediction and planning as a unified sequence modeling task. The core idea is to arrange observations, states, and actions into a single sequence, leveraging a causal transformer backbone to learn complex relationships and generate future trajectories.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Approach:** The paper presents a fresh perspective on motion prediction and planning by drawing parallels to sequence modeling problems in natural language processing. This approach allows the authors to leverage the scaling laws observed in LLMs, which is a promising direction. The formulation as a unified sequence modeling task for both motion prediction and planning is well-motivated.
*   **Scalability:** The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the scalability of STR. The authors conduct extensive experiments across three orders of magnitude in training set size and four orders of magnitude in model size, showing smooth scalability and adherence to scaling laws. This is a significant contribution, as previous works struggled to scale models effectively.
*   **Performance:** The paper demonstrates strong quantitative performance on two large real-world datasets (NuPlan and WOMD), outperforming baseline approaches. Specifically, the authors achieve state-of-the-art results on NuPlan and comparable results on WOMD.
*   **Ablation Studies:** The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the design choices of STR, particularly the impact of Key Points and diffusion decoders. These studies help to understand the contribution of each component to the overall performance.
*   **Qualitative Analysis:** The qualitative results are compelling and provide evidence that LTMs can generalize to unseen environments and make plausible predictions in challenging scenarios. The analysis of how larger models learn complex reasoning, such as stopping behind other vehicles or changing lanes for upcoming turns, is particularly insightful.
*   **Clarity and Organization:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, with a clear explanation of the proposed approach and experimental setup. The figures are helpful in visualizing the architecture of STR and the qualitative results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Lack of Rigorous Comparison on WOMD:** While the authors achieve comparable results on WOMD, they do not outperform the existing state-of-the-art by a significant margin.  The increase in mAP is incremental, and other metrics like minADE and minFDE are worse than MTR-e2e. A more in-depth analysis of the limitations of STR on WOMD is needed. The description on the WOMD model is less technical compared to the description of the NuPlan, further study is needed.
*   **Computational Cost:** Training large trajectory models, especially those with billions of parameters, requires significant computational resources. While the authors mention the hardware used, a more detailed analysis of the computational cost associated with training STR would be beneficial. Including training time/speed metrics would give other researchers a better insight into the time required to reproduce these results.
*   **Clarity on "Physical Systems":** The mention of "physical systems" is absent, despite it being part of driving. The inclusion of physical properties, like vehicle constraints, or physical rules, like collision avoidance in the model, or in the loss functions, should be emphasized.
*   **Discussion on Limitations:** While the failure cases in WOMD are discussed, a more thorough discussion of the limitations of STR, including potential failure modes in different scenarios (e.g., rare events, adversarial situations), would strengthen the paper.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **WOMD Analysis:** Perform a more detailed analysis of the performance of STR on WOMD. Investigate why STR underperforms on some metrics compared to MTR-e2e and identify potential areas for improvement.
*   **Computational Cost Analysis:** Include a more detailed analysis of the computational cost associated with training STR, including training time, memory usage, and energy consumption.
*   **Elaborate on Context Encoder and Proposal design in WOMD:** The paper's emphasis should be on the innovation and structure of STR, yet the section dedicated to WOMD is less detailed in its technical components compared to the NuPlan sections. Further improvements are needed to address this.
*   **Address "Physical System" Aspects:** Explicitly discuss the integration of physical constraints and principles into the STR framework. Explain how STR handles aspects related to physical interactions and real-world dynamics of the vehicles.
*   **Expand on Limitations:** Provide a more comprehensive discussion of the limitations of STR, including potential failure modes and areas for future research.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and scalable approach for motion prediction and planning. The experimental results are compelling, and the analysis provides valuable insights into the behavior of large trajectory models.  The idea of framing motion prediction and planning as a large sequence modeling task, inspired by LLMs, is novel and promising. While the paper has some weaknesses, the strengths outweigh them, and the contributions are significant. I recommend acceptance, pending minor revisions to address the comments above. This work has the potential to significantly advance the field of autonomous driving.
