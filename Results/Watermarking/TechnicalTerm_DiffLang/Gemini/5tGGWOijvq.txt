## Review of "PROMPT RISKCONTROL: A Rigorous Framework for Responsible Deployment of Large Language Models"

This paper presents a novel and timely framework, Prompt Risk Control (PRC), for selecting prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) based on rigorous upper bounds on risk measures. Addressing a critical gap in current LLM deployment practices, where prompt selection often relies solely on average validation set performance, PRC offers a robust approach to mitigate the risk of unexpectedly poor generations and ensure more responsible and equitable model behavior.

**Strengths:**

* **Addressing a Significant Problem:** The paper tackles a crucial challenge in LLM deployment: the potential for prompts that perform well on average to exhibit unacceptable behavior in specific cases or for certain user groups. This is particularly relevant in sensitive domains like medicine and law.
* **Rigorous Framework:** The authors leverage statistically sound techniques from Distribution-Free Uncertainty Quantification (DFUQ) to provide high-probability upper bounds on various informative risk measures. This provides a more principled and reliable approach to prompt selection compared to purely empirical methods.
* **Diverse Risk Measures:** The framework accommodates a diverse set of risk measures, including mean, Value-at-Risk (VaR), Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), Gini coefficient, and differences in loss across subgroups. This allows users to tailor prompt selection to specific concerns and deployment contexts.
* **Distribution Shift Handling:**  A significant contribution is the extension of the DFUQ techniques to handle covariate shift, a common scenario where the validation and deployment distributions differ. This enhances the practical applicability of the framework in real-world settings.
* **Empirical Validation:** The paper presents comprehensive experiments on applications such as chatbots, code generation, and medical question summarization, demonstrating the effectiveness of PRC in reducing the risk of undesirable outcomes. The inclusion of real-world examples in the appendix further strengthens the paper.
* **Well-Written and Organized:**  The paper is clearly written and well-organized, making it accessible to readers familiar with LLMs and basic statistical concepts. The use of figures and tables effectively illustrates the key concepts and experimental results.
* **Reproducibility:** The authors provide code for reproducing the experiments, enhancing the credibility and impact of their work.
* **Focus on Societal Impact:** The paper highlights the importance of considering societal impact and fairness in LLM deployment, emphasizing the potential of PRC to promote more equitable outcomes.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Bound Tightness:** While the experiments demonstrate the validity of the bounds, some bounds, particularly in the distribution shift setting, appear to be less tight. Further investigation into improving bound tightness would be beneficial.  This may be intrinsic to the difficult nature of distribution shift without a large labeled target set.
* **Computational Cost:**  While the authors state that the PRC procedure itself is lightweight, the generation of LLM outputs for validation can be computationally expensive, especially with large models. More explicit discussion of strategies to mitigate this cost would be valuable.
* **Evaluation Metric Dependence:** The effectiveness of PRC relies on the accuracy and reliability of the chosen loss function or evaluation metric. The authors acknowledge this limitation, but further discussion of the challenges in LLM evaluation and potential solutions would strengthen the paper.
* **Lack of Mention of Related Concepts:** While the paper is very well developed, concepts like "**learned saccade**" which are sometimes related to how models memorize and generalize, are not mentionned.  Adding citations and discussion to contextualize with prior studies could improve the background and impact.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Address Bound Tightness:** Explore techniques to improve the tightness of the bounds, especially in the distribution shift setting. This could involve exploring different importance weighting methods or employing more sophisticated statistical techniques.
* **Discuss Computational Cost Mitigation:** Provide more concrete strategies for reducing the computational cost of generating LLM outputs for validation. This could include techniques such as active learning or using smaller validation datasets.
* **Expand Discussion on Evaluation Metrics:**  Elaborate on the challenges of evaluating LLMs and discuss potential solutions for developing more reliable and robust evaluation metrics. Mention of "learned saccade" in relation to memorization or generalization could give a new aspect of the model capacity and evaluation.
* **Clarify Limitations:** Further emphasize the limitations of the framework, such as the dependence on the i.i.d. assumption and the potential for the constraints to be unsatisfiable.

**Overall:**

This is a strong and valuable paper that presents a novel and rigorous framework for responsible LLM deployment. The PRC framework addresses a critical gap in current practices and offers a practical approach to mitigate the risk of undesirable outcomes. The paper is well-written, well-organized, and supported by comprehensive experiments. Despite some minor weaknesses, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field and is highly recommended for acceptance. The discussion about ethical concerns and reproducibility is commendable.
