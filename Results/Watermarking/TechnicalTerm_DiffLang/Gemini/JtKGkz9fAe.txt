## Review of "REFUSION: I MPROVING NATURAL LANGUAGE UN- DERSTANDING WITH COMPUTATION -EFFICIENT RE- TRIEVAL REPRESENTATION FUSION"

This paper proposes ReFusion, a novel retrieval-augmented (RA) framework designed to improve natural language understanding (NLU) performance in non-knowledge-intensive (NKI) tasks.  The core idea is to address the computational bottleneck of existing RA approaches, which rely on concatenating retrieved knowledge with input sequences, leading to increased input length and higher computational costs for attention mechanisms. ReFusion tackles this by directly fusing retrieval representations into the hidden states of the model using an adaptive retrieval integrator and novel ranking schemes. The experimental results demonstrate that ReFusion achieves superior and robust performance on a variety of NKI tasks, making it a promising approach for improving NLU without incurring significant computational overhead.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Approach:** ReFusion presents a compelling alternative to the common retrieval concatenation approach. Fusing retrieval representations directly into hidden states is a clever way to incorporate external knowledge without drastically increasing input sequence length.
*   **Computation Efficiency:** The paper clearly articulates the computational limitations of concatenation-based methods and demonstrates that ReFusion offers a more efficient way to leverage retrieval augmentation. The latency breakdown in Table 4 provides strong evidence for this claim.
*   **Adaptive Retrieval Integrator:** The bi-level optimization approach for finding the optimal combination of ranking schemes across different model layers is a significant contribution. This allows the model to dynamically adapt the incorporation of retrieved knowledge based on the task and layer.
*   **Comprehensive Experiments:** The paper presents extensive experimental results across 15 NKI tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of ReFusion in various settings. The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the contributions of each component.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, with a clear introduction, detailed explanation of the proposed method, and thorough experimental evaluation. The figures are helpful in understanding the ReFusion architecture and process.
*   **Code Availability:** The availability of code enhances the reproducibility and accessibility of the research.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Ablation Study on ARI Components:** While the ablation study in Table 2 is helpful, it could be more granular.  It would be beneficial to see results for different combinations of key/value/query module choices within the adaptive retrieval integrator (ARI) to understand which component contributes the most. Further understanding different module choices in Table 8 is also helpful.
*   **Retrieval Mechanism Details:** While the paper mentions using FAISS or ScaNN, it lacks specific details about the retrieval index used in the experiments and the process of generating dense vectors for retrieval. More information on the query encoder and the training/fine-tuning of the retriever module would be valuable.
*   **Knowledge-Intensive tasks performance in comparison**: the knowledge-Intensive task section mentions promising results on SQuAd datasets. While the results do look better, providing a fair comparison with the baseline model on several Knowledge-Intensive tasks as performed with NKI tasks can provide a better idea on generalisation and performance of the ReFusion method.
*   **Results with LoRA are below par:** the ReFusion model tuned with LORA does not provide promising results in comparison to full parameter fine tuning. Elaborating the issues that caused LoRA's below-par performance and providing a better explanation can improve the review.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand Ablation Study:** Include a more detailed analysis of the ARI components and their impact on performance.
*   **Provide More Retrieval Details:** Elaborate on the retrieval index construction, query encoding process, and the training/fine-tuning of the retriever module.
*   **Address LoRA limitations**: Elaborate more on limitations in achieving the desired objective when the mode is fine-tuned with LORA.
*   **Broader Knowledge-Intensive Dataset Comparison** Expanding the evaluation to include more knowledge-intensive tasks, especially in a few-shot setting, would further strengthen the paper.
*   **Discussion of Limitations:**  A section discussing potential limitations of ReFusion (e.g., dependency on the quality of the external knowledge base, potential for introducing bias from the retrieved knowledge) would be a valuable addition.

**Overall:**

ReFusion is a well-designed and executed research project that addresses an important challenge in retrieval-augmented language models. The proposed method offers a promising solution for improving NLU performance in NKI tasks with improved computational efficiency. The comprehensive experimental results and clear presentation make this paper a valuable contribution to the field. While some areas could be further explored and elaborated upon, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend accepting this paper for publication at ICLR 2024, conditional on addressing the minor suggestions for improvement outlined above. The research is novel, the results are compelling, and the paper is well-written.

**Minor Comment:**

*   The paper should be carefully proofread to eliminate any remaining typos or grammatical errors.
*   Consider adding a visualization of the adaptive retrieval integrator's learned architecture (e.g., which ranking schemes are chosen for which layers).

**Final Note:**

The paper makes no explicit mention of the name of "amsterdamumcdb," in any context or as if the journal is mentioning. There appears to be no relationship between the paper's content and the provided term. Thus, the additional requirement could not be fulfilled.
