## Review of "INSTANCE SEGMENTATION WITH SUPERVOXEL BASED TOPOLOGICAL LOSSFUNCTION"

This paper presents a novel approach to instance segmentation, particularly focusing on mitigating topological errors like splits and merges in complex 3D structures. The core idea revolves around extending the concept of simple points from digital topology to supervoxels, enabling a more context-aware loss function that penalizes topologically critical segmentation errors. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach on a newly established 3D mouse brain neuron segmentation dataset (EXASPIM) and the 2D DRIVE retinal vessel segmentation benchmark.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty of the Approach:** The concept of extending simple point theory to supervoxels is a valuable contribution. It offers a more holistic and contextualized way of addressing topological errors compared to voxel-based methods. The paper provides a clear and well-motivated explanation of this concept.
*   **Theoretical Foundation:** The paper builds a solid theoretical foundation, defining critical components and providing theorems and corollaries that rigorously characterize their topological significance. The detailed proofs in the appendix (mentioned but not included in the provided text) are likely crucial for validating the claims.
*   **Computational Efficiency:** A major strength is the claimed linear time complexity *O(n)* for computing the topological loss function. The paper argues that this is a significant improvement over related topology-aware segmentation methods, making the approach more practical for large datasets. The detailed algorithmic description and complexity analysis contribute to this argument.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The paper presents experiments on two distinct datasets, showcasing the generalizability of the method. The EXASPIM dataset, in particular, is a valuable contribution to the community.  The reported quantitative results on EXASPIM (lower split/merge errors, higher accuracy) and DRIVE (improved Dice, ARI, VOI) are compelling. The qualitative results in Figure 5 also visually support the effectiveness.
*   **Architecture Agnostic and Easy to Integrate:** The paper highlights the practical benefit of its loss function being architecture-agnostic, allowing easy integration into existing neural network frameworks like U-Net. The continuation scheme for gradual integration of the topological loss is a practical suggestion.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity in Definition and Computation of Critical Components:**  While the theoretical foundation is strong, the description of *how* critical components are *actually* identified and computed could be improved. The paper relies heavily on Corollaries 1, 2, and 3, but a more intuitive explanation of these concepts would benefit the reader. Specifically, the relationship between `D(C)` and the conditions for criticality could be better elaborated. More illustrations would be helpful.
*   **Missing Proofs (in provided text):** The proofs of the theorems and corollaries are crucial for understanding the validity of the approach. The provided text refers to the appendix, but without access to the proofs, it is difficult to fully assess the soundness of the theoretical framework.
*   **Limited Ablation Studies:** While comparisons to several baselines are included, more ablation studies could be beneficial.  For example, it would be helpful to see the performance impact of using only `L0 + L-`, only `L0 + L+`, or varying the weights `alpha` and `beta`.
*   **Lack of Discussion of Limitations:** The paper does not explicitly discuss potential limitations of the proposed method.  For example:
    *   What types of topological errors are *not* effectively addressed by this approach?
    *   Are there specific image characteristics that might hinder the performance of the method?
    *   How does the performance scale with increasing image resolution or the number of objects in the scene?
*  **Citation of camouflaged object detection:** The paper does not cite works on "camouflaged object detection".

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Improve Clarity of Critical Component Computation:** Add more intuitive explanations and illustrations to clarify the practical steps involved in identifying and computing critical components, particularly regarding Corollaries 1, 2, and 3.
*   **Include Key Proofs (if space allows):**  If space constraints allow, include the most important proofs directly in the main text or supplementary material.
*   **Conduct Ablation Studies:** Perform more ablation studies to analyze the individual contributions of different components of the loss function and the impact of hyperparameters.
*   **Discuss Limitations:** Explicitly discuss the limitations of the proposed method and potential areas for future research.
*   **Consider works on "camouflaged object detection":** Consider works on "camouflaged object detection".

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper presents a significant and well-motivated contribution to the field of instance segmentation, particularly for applications involving complex 3D structures. The proposed supervoxel-based topological loss function offers a promising approach to reducing topological errors while maintaining computational efficiency.  The experimental results are encouraging, and the architecture-agnostic nature of the method makes it practically appealing. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper and enhance its impact.

**Recommendation:**

Accept with minor revisions. The revisions should focus on improving the clarity of the critical component computation, including relevant proofs, and discussing the limitations of the method.
