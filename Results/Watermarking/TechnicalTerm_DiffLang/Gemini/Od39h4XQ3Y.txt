## Review of "Efficient Sharpness-Aware Minimization for Molecular Graph Transformer Models"

This paper presents GraphSAM, a novel algorithm designed to improve the efficiency of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) when applied to molecular graph transformer models. The paper addresses a key limitation of SAM, its doubled computational cost compared to standard optimizers, and argues that existing efficient SAM variants developed for computer vision are not directly transferable to the molecular graph domain. The proposed GraphSAM leverages observations about the training gradient behavior of molecular graph transformers to approximate the perturbation gradient, thereby reducing the computational overhead.

**Strengths:**

*   **Well-Motivated Problem:** The paper clearly identifies the problem of high computational cost associated with SAM and the limitations of directly applying computer vision-centric efficient SAM variants to molecular graph transformers. The motivation is grounded in the observation that pre-training-free graph transformers tend to converge to sharp local minima, leading to poor generalization.
*   **Interesting Observations:** The core idea of GraphSAM is built upon two key observations about the gradients during training: 1) the perturbation gradient changes relatively slowly, and 2) there's a similarity between the updating gradient and the subsequent perturbation gradient. These observations, supported by experimental data, provide a strong foundation for the proposed approximation.
*   **Novel Algorithm:** GraphSAM proposes a clever approach to approximate the perturbation gradient by reusing the updating gradient from the previous step, incorporating a moving average and periodic re-anchoring. This effectively reduces the computational cost while attempting to maintain the generalization benefits of SAM.
*   **Theoretical Justification:** The paper provides theoretical analysis to justify the gradient approximation and demonstrate that the loss landscape of GraphSAM is constrained within a small range of the expected loss of SAM. This theoretical grounding strengthens the claims about GraphSAM's generalization properties.
*   **Comprehensive Experiments:** The experimental evaluation is thorough, covering six benchmark molecular datasets with different tasks (classification and regression). The results demonstrate the superiority of GraphSAM compared to standard optimizers (Adam) and several existing efficient SAM variants, particularly in terms of throughput and generalization performance. The ablation studies on the ρ scheduler and re-anchoring frequency provide valuable insights into the algorithm's behavior and parameter sensitivity.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the problem, motivation, algorithm, and experimental results. The figures effectively illustrate the key concepts and observations. The code is publicly available, which is essential for reproducibility.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Domain Specificity:** While the domain-specific tailoring of GraphSAM is a strength, it also limits its generalizability. The paper acknowledges this in the discussion of CV-based SAM variants, but a more explicit discussion of the potential limitations of GraphSAM outside the specific context of molecular graph transformers would be beneficial. Mentioning potential issues if `"nerf for driving"` contexts are used.
*   **Justification for Hyperparameter Settings:** While the paper mentions tuning the hyperparameters of GraphSAM, the specific rationale behind the chosen settings and their impact on performance could be elaborated. For example, more detail could be provided on why β=0.99 is optimal.
*   **Clarity on Re-Anchoring:** The re-anchoring process is crucial for maintaining the accuracy of the perturbation gradient approximation. While mentioned, the re-anchoring process is not explained very deeply. The number of re-anchoring instances can be more clearly presented.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Explicitly Discuss Limitations:** Add a section discussing the limitations of GraphSAM, specifically addressing its applicability to other domains or model architectures where the observed gradient behaviors might not hold. Consider how the method might work with or compete against `"nerf for driving"` algorithms.
*   **Elaborate on Hyperparameter Selection:** Provide a more detailed discussion of the hyperparameter tuning process, explaining the rationale behind the chosen values and their impact on performance. Consider including a sensitivity analysis of the key hyperparameters.
*   **Clarify Re-Anchoring Strategy:** Provide more specific details about the re-anchoring process, including the frequency of re-anchoring and the impact of different re-anchoring strategies on performance.
*   **Consider Different Graph Architectures:** While the paper focuses on GROVER and CoMPT, exploring the performance of GraphSAM on other graph transformer architectures would strengthen the generalizability claims.
*   **Minor Editorial Suggestions:** There are a few minor grammatical errors and inconsistencies throughout the paper (e.g., Table 13 is mentioned but doesn't seem to exist), which should be addressed for clarity.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of efficient optimization for molecular graph transformers. GraphSAM effectively addresses the computational cost of SAM while maintaining good generalization performance. The paper is well-motivated, theoretically sound, and supported by comprehensive experimental results. Despite some minor weaknesses, the paper is of high quality and warrants acceptance at ICLR 2024.
