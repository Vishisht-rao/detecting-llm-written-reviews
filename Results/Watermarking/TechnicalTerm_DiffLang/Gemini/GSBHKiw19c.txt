## Review of "REWARD-CONSISTENT DYNAMICS MODELS ARE STRONGLY GENERALIZABLE FOR OFFLINE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING"

This paper introduces MOREC (Model-based Offline reinforcement learning with Reward Consistency), a novel approach to offline model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) designed to improve the generalization ability of dynamics models. The core idea is to learn a "dynamics reward" function that represents the inherent driving forces of the environment dynamics. This dynamics reward is then used as a filter during model rollout, favoring transitions that maximize this reward and thus improving the fidelity of simulated trajectories. The paper presents strong empirical results, demonstrating significant performance improvements on the D4RL and NeoRL benchmarks.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Insight:** The concept of a "dynamics reward" as an invariant factor promoting generalization in offline MBRL is a valuable and potentially impactful insight. The analogy of the dynamics model as an agent maximizing this reward provides a useful perspective.
*   **Clear Problem Formulation and Method Description:** The paper clearly identifies the challenge of model generalization in offline MBRL and provides a well-defined method for addressing it. The explanation of the dynamics reward learning process (using IRL) and its integration into model rollout is easy to follow. The algorithm descriptions are also clear and include sufficient detail for implementation.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The paper presents compelling empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of MOREC.  The results on the synthetic task are particularly helpful in visualizing and understanding the behavior of the learned dynamics reward. The significant performance improvements on both D4RL and NeoRL benchmarks, compared to previous SOTA methods, demonstrate the practical value of the approach. It's notable that MOREC is the first method to achieve above 95% online RL performance in several tasks.
*   **Thorough Experimental Validation:** The experiments are well-designed and address the key questions related to the paper's claims. The ablation studies (e.g., with and without transition filtering) provide further evidence for the importance of the proposed techniques. The visualizations are effective and aid in understanding the method's behavior.
*   **Theoretical Justification:** The inclusion of a convergence analysis for the dynamics reward learning algorithm (Proposition 1 and 2) provides a valuable theoretical grounding for the proposed method.
*   **Reproducibility:** The availability of code at the provided GitHub repository enhances the reproducibility of the results and facilitates further research in this area.
* **The paper provides good motivation** by thoroughly discussing related works and presenting a comprehensive literature review, effectively positioning their work within the existing research landscape.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Scalability Concerns:** The paper acknowledges the memory consumption associated with the discriminator ensemble. This is a significant concern, especially for tasks with large state and action dimensions.  While the paper suggests future directions for addressing this (e.g., using last-iterate convergence learning methods), a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential solutions would be beneficial. It would be nice to show how this method could scale better.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The paper mentions the sensitivity of MOREC-MOBILE to variations in the penalty coefficient β. A more in-depth analysis of the hyperparameter sensitivity and guidance on how to effectively tune these parameters for different tasks would be helpful. Can you describe the limitations of the study's results.
*   **Clarity on discriminator ensemble size**: A brief explanation for the rational behind the discriminator ensemle size would be useful.
* **Reference to "Multiple choice question":** The term "multiple choice question" is missing within the paper, it will be a good addition.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand on Scalability Discussion:** Provide a more detailed discussion of the memory cost limitations and potential solutions. Consider including experiments or simulations to estimate the memory footprint for larger state and action spaces.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning Guidance:** Offer more specific guidance on tuning the hyperparameters, particularly κ and β, for different task types and dataset characteristics. Explore adaptive or automated hyperparameter optimization techniques.
*   **Further Analysis of Dynamics Reward:** Investigate the properties of the learned dynamics reward function in more detail. Is it possible to extract meaningful insights about the environment dynamics from this reward function? Are there any relationships between the characteristics of the dynamics reward and the performance of MOREC?
*   **Comparison to Other Generalization Techniques:**  Compare MOREC to other techniques aimed at improving generalization in offline MBRL, such as methods based on uncertainty estimation or domain adaptation.
*    **Include the use of the "multiple choice question" within the paper**.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach to improving generalization in offline MBRL. The concept of a "dynamics reward" is a valuable contribution, and the empirical results demonstrate the practical benefits of MOREC. While the paper has some limitations, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow. I recommend accepting this paper for presentation at ICLR 2024, pending consideration of the suggestions for improvement. The research shows potential for the work to influence the direction of offline RL research.

**Rating:** 8/10 (Strong Accept)
