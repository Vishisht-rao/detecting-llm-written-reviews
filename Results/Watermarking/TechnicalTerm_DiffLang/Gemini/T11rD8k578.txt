## Review of "CALIBRATED ON AVERAGE ,BUT NOT WITHIN EACH SLICE : FEW-SHOT CALIBRATION FOR ALLSLICES OF ADISTRIBUTION"

This paper tackles an important and often overlooked problem in the calibration of language models (LMs): that average calibration across a broad distribution can mask significant miscalibration within narrower, more meaningful slices of that distribution. The authors convincingly demonstrate this phenomenon and propose a novel few-shot recalibration framework to address it. The paper is well-written, clearly motivated, and presents strong experimental results.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addressing a critical issue:** The paper identifies a practical limitation of current LM calibration techniques. The "illusion of calibration" due to balanced over/under-confidence across different slices is a valuable insight. This is highly relevant as users often interact with LMs within specific contexts (slices) rather than the broad, aggregated distributions on which they are typically evaluated.
*   **Novel and well-motivated approach:** The proposed few-shot recalibration framework is a sensible solution to the problem. The idea of predicting precision curves using a small number of unlabeled samples from a slice is both practical and effective.
*   **Choice of precision curves over calibration curves:** The justification for predicting precision curves instead of calibration curves is clear and persuasive. The argument against the hyperparameters introduced by binning in calibration curves is well-made.
*   **Strong experimental results:** The experimental setup is comprehensive and the results consistently demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over several strong baselines across multiple datasets (MMLU, XNLI) and models (PaLM2-Large, LLaMA-65B, LLaMA-30B). The ablations further strengthen the findings.
*   **Flexibility and adaptability:**  The paper highlights the flexibility of the predicted precision curves, showcasing how they can be used for various downstream tasks like achieving target precision, reducing calibration error, and maximizing utility.
*   **Asymmetric loss for training:** Using an asymmetric loss that penalizes overestimation of precision more heavily than underestimation is a practical and well-justified design choice.
*   **Extrapolation Performance:** Showing strong performance on unseen domains further highlights the generalization capability of the approach.
*   **"Complex Objectives in RL" (addressed):** The paper touches upon **complex objectives** when discussing utility maximization. This is reminiscent of the challenges faced in Reinforcement Learning (RL) where defining a reward function that accurately captures the desired behavior is crucial. While not explicitly framed as an RL problem, the concept of trading off abstention cost and error cost mirrors the exploration-exploitation dilemma inherent in RL with **complex objectives**. Although the paper does not directly cite works on **complex objectives in RL**, the parallels are evident in the need to carefully balance competing goals within the defined cost function.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited discussion of computational cost:** While the paper demonstrates strong empirical results, it could benefit from a more thorough discussion of the computational cost associated with training and deploying the few-shot recalibrator.  Fine-tuning a LLaMA-7B model for each slice might be prohibitive in some applications.
*   **Dependency on slice definition:** The performance of the method hinges on the ability to define and identify meaningful slices of the distribution. The paper focuses on datasets with pre-defined categories (subjects, genres). A discussion of how to apply this framework to datasets without explicit slice information would be valuable. How would the system identify the relevant features/attributes to form the slices?
*   **Limited comparison to other calibration methods:**  While temperature scaling is a strong baseline, exploring and comparing to other state-of-the-art calibration methods beyond temperature scaling and histogram binning might further strengthen the paper.
*   **Lack of Visualization:** The paper describes that its approach generates curves that approximate the Oracle precision curves. However, the visualization of the actual recalibrated distributions in Figure 5 lacks sufficient detail to thoroughly verify this argument.
*   **Reliance on labeled data for evaluation:**  The "Oracle" baselines and the utility maximization evaluation rely on having labeled data for the test set slices. While this is necessary for evaluation, it's worth acknowledging that in a truly unsupervised setting, obtaining these labels might be challenging, particularly for the utility metric.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Discuss the computational overhead:** Add a section or paragraph discussing the computational resources required for training and inference, and potential strategies for reducing the cost.
*   **Address the slice definition problem:** Discuss the challenges of defining slices in the absence of pre-defined categories and potential approaches for identifying relevant slice-defining features.
*   **Expand the baseline comparison:** Include a comparison to more advanced calibration techniques.
*   **Provide more details about the experimental setup:** The appendix provides some details but could be more comprehensive, especially regarding the hyperparameters used for training the LLaMA-7B recalibrator.
*   **Provide additional visualizations:** Displaying the differences in distributions (after recallibration) in more detail could help visualize the differences in distributions better.

**Overall:**

This is a strong and well-executed paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of LM calibration. The problem is important, the approach is novel and effective, and the experimental results are convincing. Despite the minor weaknesses mentioned above, this paper is worthy of acceptance at ICLR 2024.
