## Review of "Decoupled Prioritized Resampling: Advancing Offline RL with Improved Behavior Policy"

This paper presents Offline Decoupled Prioritized Resampling (ODPR), a novel approach to improve offline reinforcement learning (RL) performance by prioritizing transitions in the dataset based on action quality. The key idea is to implicitly improve the behavior policy by upweighting advantageous actions, thereby enabling the learning of better policies under common policy constraint frameworks.  The paper provides theoretical justification for the approach, detailing how prioritized sampling can lead to an improved behavior policy and, under certain conditions, a better learned policy. Two practical implementations, ODPR-A (advantage-based) and ODPR-R (return-based), are proposed and empirically evaluated, showing significant performance gains across multiple offline RL algorithms and diverse datasets.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Idea:** The idea of improving the behavior policy *implicitly* through prioritized resampling is a valuable contribution to the offline RL landscape.  Instead of directly constraining the policy to the original, potentially suboptimal, behavior, ODPR aims to shape the data distribution to encourage learning from better actions.
*   **Theoretical Justification:**  The paper offers theoretical analysis supporting the claim that ODPR leads to improved behavior policies and potentially better learned policies. Theorems 3.1 and the subsequent discussion on learned policy improvement provide a formal basis for the empirical observations.
*   **Practical Implementations:** The two practical implementations, ODPR-A and ODPR-R, offer different trade-offs between computational cost and performance. ODPR-R's simplicity makes it attractive for quick experimentation, while ODPR-A's iterative prioritization allows for potentially better results.  The plug-and-play nature of ODPR is a significant advantage.
*   **Comprehensive Experiments:**  The experimental evaluation is thorough, demonstrating the effectiveness of ODPR across a variety of offline RL algorithms (BC, TD3+BC, Onestep RL, CQL, IQL) and D4RL benchmark datasets (Mujoco, Antmaze, Kitchen, Adroit).  The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the importance of decoupled resampling and the effect of different design choices.
*   **Well-Written and Clear:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The motivation is clearly explained, and the technical details are presented in a logical manner. The figures, especially Figure 1, effectively illustrate the core concepts.
*   **Clear Statement about Reproducibility:** The paper ends with a concise but clear statement about reproducibility, confirming that all the results presented can be reproduced, and promising to make both the code and the weights public.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Strong Assumption in Learned Policy Improvement:** The theoretical justification for learned policy improvement relies on the assumption that dβ′(s) = dβ(s).  While the authors acknowledge this limitation, it is a strong assumption that may not hold in practice, potentially limiting the generalizability of the theoretical results.  Discussing the potential impact of deviations from this assumption would strengthen the analysis.
*   **Computational Cost of ODPR-A:** While the authors address the computational cost of ODPR-A, further analysis of the trade-offs between computation time and performance improvement would be valuable. Specifically, comparing the performance of vanilla algorithms trained for a longer time (equal to the time spent on ODPR-A) would provide a more convincing argument that the gains are due to improved behavior policy rather than simply increased training.
*   **Limited Discussion of Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** While the paper provides some information about the settings, a more in-depth discussion about the sensitivity of ODPR to hyperparameters like σ, and the number of iterations K, would be helpful. Specifically, it's not clear whether the values mentioned in this paper can be applied to domains beyond the specific ones used to find these values.
*   **Missing Citations on "Random Seed" and "Data Selection":** In the discussion of the experiment setup and related works, there are a few key terms missing relevant citations. The "random seed" term should include citations for papers which also detail experiments with differing random seeds. Furthermore, the data selection methods deserve to be cited.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Discuss the impact of deviations from the dβ′(s) = dβ(s) assumption.** Explore how violations of this assumption might affect the learned policy improvement and consider alternative theoretical frameworks that might be more robust.
*   **Provide a more detailed comparison of ODPR-A with vanilla algorithms trained for equivalent time.** This will strengthen the argument that ODPR's gains stem from improved behavior policy rather than simply increased training time.
*   **Include a more in-depth discussion about the sensitivity of ODPR to hyperparameters, particularly σ and K.** Provide guidelines for setting these parameters in different domains. Consider adding additional ablation studies to better understand the impact of these hyperparameters on performance.
*   **Add Citations on "Random Seed" and "Data Selection".** In the discussion of the experiment setup and related works, there are a few key terms missing relevant citations. The "random seed" term should include citations for papers which also detail experiments with differing "random seed"s. Furthermore, the data selection methods deserve to be cited.
*   **Consider adding more visualization and analysis of the learned policies after applying ODPR.** This would provide more insight into how ODPR shapes the behavior policy and what strategies the learned policies are adopting.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper with a novel idea, solid theoretical foundation, and comprehensive experimental evaluation. ODPR offers a promising approach to improve offline RL performance, and the proposed techniques are likely to be of interest to the broader RL community.  Addressing the minor weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper and make it an even more valuable contribution. I recommend acceptance, conditional on addressing the suggested improvements.
