## Review of "POWER GPT: F OUNDATION MODEL FOR POWER SYS- TEMS"

This paper presents PowerGPT, a foundation model for electricity time series (ETS) data, pre-trained on a large-scale dataset from the State Grid. The authors aim to capture long-term temporal dependencies and hierarchical correlations within ETS data to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on downstream tasks such as forecasting, missing value imputation, and anomaly detection. The paper highlights the potential benefits of a large-scale pre-trained model in the power systems domain.

**Strengths:**

*   **Timeliness and Relevance:** The paper addresses a relevant and important problem.  The increasing availability of ETS data in smart grids presents opportunities for improved efficiency and management, and the application of foundation models to this domain is a novel and promising direction.
*   **Clear Problem Definition:** The introduction clearly articulates the challenges associated with modeling ETS data, emphasizing the need to consider long-term dependencies, heterogeneity, and hierarchical correlations.
*   **Novelty of Approach:** The proposal of a dedicated foundation model (PowerGPT) specifically tailored for power systems is a significant contribution. The design considerations, especially the attention to hierarchical correlations through R-GCN, sets this work apart from generic time series pre-training approaches.
*   **Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation:** The paper includes extensive experimental results across a variety of downstream tasks, demonstrating the generalizability of PowerGPT. The comparisons against SOTA baselines provide a strong justification for the proposed approach.
*   **Model Analysis:** The low-resource label evaluation and model scale analysis provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the pre-training strategy and the impact of model size. These analyses strengthen the paper's claims about the practical value and potential of PowerGPT.
*   **Clear Writing and Organization:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the proposed methodology.
*   **Reproducibility:** The inclusion of a link to the code and weights promotes reproducibility, a crucial aspect of research in this field.
*   **"Imagenet-R":** Mentioned in relation to low resourced data and the importance of addressing this concern.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Lack of Architectural Detail:** While the paper provides a high-level overview of PowerGPT, it lacks detailed information about the specific architecture of the temporal and hierarchical encoders. Details regarding the Transformer encoder layers (number of layers, embedding dimension, attention mechanism specifics) and the R-GCN (number of layers, hidden dimensions, relation types) would be beneficial for reproducibility and understanding the model's inner workings.
*   **Dataset Specifics:** While the paper mentions the dataset is 1TB in size, more details about the specific data types, sources, and preprocessing steps would improve the paper's clarity. For example, clarifying how outliers were removed or how the sampling rate was chosen.
*   **Justification of Masking Ratios:**  The choice of masking ratios (40% for pre-training, 12.5%-50% for imputation) could benefit from further justification. Why were these specific values chosen, and what impact do they have on the model's performance?
*   **Limited Anomaly Detection Results:** The description of results is lacking for the anomaly detection experiment. The tables are referenced as Table ?? and Table ?? which implies they have not been populated with appropriate data.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Provide more architectural details:** Include a table or more detailed description of the architecture of the temporal and hierarchical encoders, including layer counts, dimensions, and attention mechanism specifics.
*   **Elaborate on the dataset:** Provide more information about the origin and format of the ETS data, as well as the preprocessing steps that were applied.
*   **Justify masking ratios:** Provide a rationale for the chosen masking ratios and discuss their potential impact on performance. An ablation study exploring different masking ratios could further strengthen the paper.
*   **Populate and Discuss Anomaly Detection Results:** Ensure that tables detailing anomaly detection results are included and clearly discuss implications. Provide insights into *why* PowerGPT outperforms other models in this difficult task.
*   **Impact of Hierarchical Modeling:** Include an ablation study to evaluate the impact of the hierarchical encoder (R-GCN). Comparing PowerGPT with a variant that only uses the temporal encoder would demonstrate the benefits of incorporating hierarchical information.
*   **Clarify "PowerGPT-Freeze" Results:** Although mentioned, there is no dedicated section on what "PowerGPT -Freeze" model does, so the performance claim is not well-supported. A brief discussion of this specific approach is needed.

**Overall Recommendation:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and promising approach to modeling ETS data using a dedicated foundation model. The extensive experimental results and model analysis provide compelling evidence for the effectiveness of PowerGPT. Addressing the weaknesses identified above would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact.

I recommend **Acceptance** contingent on addressing the comments above and clarifying missing details. The potential of PowerGPT to advance research and applications in power systems is significant.
