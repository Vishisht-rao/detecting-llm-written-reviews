## Review of "OPEN THE BLACK BOX: STEP-BASED POLICY UPDATES FOR TEMPORALLY -CORRELATED EPISODIC REINFORCEMENT LEARNING"

**Overall Impression:**

This paper presents a compelling and well-motivated approach to episodic reinforcement learning (ERL). By introducing Temporally-Correlated Episodic RL (TCE), the authors address a significant limitation of traditional ERL methods, namely, their reliance on black-box optimization and neglect of step-based information.  The paper is clearly written, well-structured, and supported by comprehensive experimental results across a variety of challenging robotic manipulation tasks. The proposed TCE algorithm demonstrates a promising synergy between the benefits of both step-based and episodic RL, achieving comparable data efficiency to state-of-the-art SRL methods while maintaining the trajectory smoothness characteristic of ERL.  This work represents a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** TCE offers a genuinely innovative approach to ERL by integrating step-based information into policy updates. This "opening the black box" concept addresses a critical inefficiency in existing ERL methods and has the potential to significantly improve their learning efficiency.
*   **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is exceptionally well-written and organized. The introduction effectively highlights the limitations of both SRL and ERL, motivating the need for TCE. The algorithm is explained in a clear and concise manner, and the figures (particularly Figure 3) provide valuable visual aids.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The experimental evaluation is thorough and well-designed. The use of the Metaworld benchmark, a customized Hopper Jump task, and a box-pushing task with both dense and sparse reward settings provides a comprehensive assessment of TCE's performance. The comparison against a diverse set of baseline methods, including PPO, SAC, TRPL, gSDE, PINK, and BBRL, further strengthens the validity of the results.
*   **Ablation Studies:**  The inclusion of ablation studies, such as comparing TCE with a PPO-style trust region and examining the impact of the number of segments (K), adds depth to the analysis and provides valuable insights into the algorithm's behavior.
*   **Addressing Movement Correlations:** The paper effectively demonstrates the importance of capturing temporal and cross-DoF correlations in actions. The enhanced BBRL version (BBRL Cov) and the superior performance of TCE compared to the original BBRL further underscore this point.  The action correlation visualizations are very helpful.
*   **Reproducibility:** The code availability on GitHub significantly enhances the reproducibility of the results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Sparse Reward Performance:**  The paper acknowledges that TCE's performance is moderate for tasks with very sparse reward settings, such as the table tennis task. While this is an honest assessment, further investigation into mitigating this limitation could be a valuable direction for future research. The paper could explore reasons behind the relative underperformance compared to BBRL Cov.
*   **Threshold Consistency:** A deeper dive into the reasons behind "threshold consistency" should be undertaken. How does the threshold consistency benefit the algorithm, and why is it a good approach?
*   **Low-Level Controller Dependency:** The reliance on a low-level tracking controller, as with many ERL approaches, is noted as a potential limitation. Expanding the discussion on the feasibility of using TCE in tasks where such controllers are not available could be beneficial.

**Specific Comments and Suggestions:**

*   **Equation 1:**  Consider adding a brief explanation of the terms in Equation 1 to ensure that the reader fully understands the learning objective of ERL before TCE is introduced.
*   **Figure 1:**  The illustrations in Figure 1 are helpful, but could be slightly enhanced by explicitly labeling the axes and providing a brief caption explaining the key differences between the exploration strategies.
*   **Appendix B:** It is really good, and can be included as a mathematical background instead of in the appendix.
*   **Algorithm 1:** Very good algorithm, easy to follow and reproduce
*   **Clarify Computational Cost:** While the paper touches upon computational cost, a more explicit comparison of the computational complexity of TCE and the baseline methods would be valuable.
*   **Impact of Time Pair Selection:** The method relies on selecting time pairs. How sensitive is the performance to different time pair selection strategies (e.g., evenly spaced, random, informed)?  A brief discussion on this aspect would strengthen the paper.

**Conclusion:**

This is a high-quality paper that presents a significant advancement in the field of episodic reinforcement learning. The proposed TCE algorithm effectively addresses a key limitation of traditional ERL methods and demonstrates promising performance across a range of challenging robotic manipulation tasks. The paper is well-written, well-supported by experimental results, and offers valuable insights into the design and implementation of ERL algorithms. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the points raised above.
