## Review of "Exploring the Impact of Information Entropy Change in Learning Systems"

This paper investigates the impact of noise injection on deep learning systems, framing it within the context of information entropy. The core idea is that noise, often viewed as detrimental, can be "positive" if it reduces task complexity (defined via information entropy).  The paper theoretically analyzes the impact of Gaussian, linear transform, and salt-and-pepper noise and then experimentally validates its claims on image classification and domain adaptation tasks using CNNs and ViTs.  The authors claim to achieve state-of-the-art results on ImageNet with their proposed approach.

**Strengths:**

*   **Interesting and Novel Perspective:** The paper offers a fresh perspective on noise injection, moving beyond the conventional view of it being solely harmful.  The framing in terms of information entropy and task complexity is a compelling conceptual framework.
*   **Theoretical Justification:** The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the impact of different noise types on entropy change, which is a significant strength. The mathematical derivations, particularly for Gaussian and linear transform noise, provide a foundation for the empirical observations.
*   **Extensive Experiments:** The paper presents a wide range of experiments on ImageNet and TinyImageNet, using different CNN and ViT architectures. The ablation studies on noise strength and injection layer are valuable. The inclusion of domain adaptation experiments further strengthens the validation.
*   **Performance Improvements:** The reported performance gains, especially the claim of exceeding 95% accuracy on ImageNet, are impressive and would be a major contribution if verified.
*   **Clarity of Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and clearly explains the concepts and methodology. The figures and tables are helpful in understanding the results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Lack of Novelty/Discussion of Vision-Language Pretraining:** A major shortcoming is the **complete absence of any discussion or citations related to vision-language pretraining (VLP) methods.**  Many recent advances in image classification and domain adaptation are built upon pre-trained models like CLIP, ALIGN, Florence, etc., which utilize vision-language pretraining. These methods also often leverage noise and data augmentation techniques, sometimes framed implicitly or explicitly around regularization. The paper fails to acknowledge this extensive body of work, and therefore, the contributions feel isolated and potentially less significant. This omission severely limits the perceived novelty of the approach. The paper *must* address this gap to be considered for acceptance. This point is critical, and is the single largest issue with the paper.
*   **"Positive Noise" Definition Can Be Misleading:** While the concept of "positive noise" is interesting, the definition based solely on entropy change might be too simplistic. It doesn't fully capture the nuances of how noise interacts with the learning process. A more thorough discussion of the *mechanisms* by which certain noise types contribute to better generalization would be beneficial. Simply reducing task complexity doesn't fully explain why models trained with positive noise perform better.
*   **Limited Discussion of Optimal Quality Matrix:** The introduction of the "optimal quality matrix" is interesting, but the paper lacks a deeper discussion about its properties and the intuition behind its form. Why does this specific matrix maximize entropy change under the given constraints? More justification is needed.
*   **Overfitting Concerns:** The paper mentions that ViT-L is overfitting on ImageNet, which might explain why positive noise doesn't work as well for that architecture. However, the paper doesn't thoroughly analyze the potential for overfitting in other architectures or datasets. How does the choice of noise strength affect overfitting?  This needs to be addressed.
*   **Experimental Details Missing:** While the paper mentions experimental settings, there's a lack of specific details that would allow for reproducibility.  For instance, what specific data augmentation techniques were used (or not used)? What were the hyperparameters for the noise injection process?  More detail is needed.
*   **Claim of SOTA Needs Stronger Justification:** The claim of achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet needs to be backed up with a more thorough comparison to existing methods.  The current comparison in Table 3 is insufficient. The paper needs to consider the *training costs* (e.g., compute, data) when comparing to these methods. Beating SOTA with techniques that are significantly more efficient would be far more valuable.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Incorporate Vision-Language Pretraining Literature:** This is absolutely crucial. The authors *must* discuss and cite relevant works on vision-language pretraining and how their approach relates to, or differs from, existing techniques. Explain why injecting noise within the fine-tuning of a model pretrained with VLP can improve performance further.
*   **Deepen Discussion of Positive Noise Mechanisms:** Provide more insight into *why* certain noise types lead to better generalization. Relate this back to regularization, preventing overfitting, or promoting better feature representations.
*   **Elaborate on Optimal Quality Matrix:** Explain the intuition behind the optimal quality matrix and its connection to entropy change maximization.
*   **Address Overfitting Concerns:** Analyze the impact of noise strength on overfitting and provide strategies for mitigating this issue.
*   **Provide More Experimental Details:** Include all the necessary experimental details to allow for reproducibility, including data augmentation techniques, hyperparameter settings, and training protocols.
*   **Strengthen SOTA Claim:** Provide a more comprehensive comparison to existing state-of-the-art methods, considering training costs and efficiency.
*   **Clearly State Computational Resources Used:** Specify the hardware used for training (e.g., GPU type, number of GPUs) and the approximate training time for each experiment.
* **Add Vision-language pretraining term** in Related Works and introduction.
**Overall Assessment:**

The paper presents an interesting idea and provides theoretical and empirical evidence to support its claims. However, the paper has significant weaknesses, particularly the failure to address the existing body of work on vision-language pretraining. Until these weaknesses are addressed, the paper is not ready for publication at ICLR. I recommend a **Reject** with the possibility of resubmission after major revisions.
