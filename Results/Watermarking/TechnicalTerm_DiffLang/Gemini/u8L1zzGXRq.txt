## Review of "IMPACT OF MOLECULAR REPRESENTATIONS ON DEEP LEARNING MODEL COMPARISONS IN DRUG RESPONSE PREDICTIONS"

This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark of different molecular representations for deep learning models in the context of drug response prediction. The authors introduce CMP-CV, an automated cross-validation framework, and use it to compare graph-based, descriptor-based, fingerprint-based, and SMILES-based representations.  A key contribution is the analysis of model performance across different domains of the drug descriptor space, highlighting the importance of domain-specific model selection.  The work is relevant to the ICLR community interested in representation learning and its impact on downstream tasks, particularly in scientific domains.

**Strengths:**

*   **Well-defined Problem and Motivation:** The paper clearly articulates the challenge of inconsistent benchmarks and the need for standardized model comparison in drug response prediction. The introduction effectively highlights the limitations of existing approaches and motivates the development of CMP-CV.
*   **Novelty of Approach:** The domain-based model comparison is a valuable contribution.  Analyzing prediction errors within specific regions of the descriptor space offers a more nuanced understanding of model strengths and weaknesses compared to relying solely on global metrics like R2 or RMSE. The web application for model selection based on multiple descriptor values is a practical and potentially impactful tool.
*   **Comprehensive Benchmarking:** The paper includes a good selection of existing CDRP models and incorporates custom models to isolate the impact of different drug representations.  The use of a standardized dataset (CTRPv2) enhances the comparability of the results.
*   **Well-structured and Clearly Written:** The paper is generally well-organized and easy to follow. The figures are informative and contribute to understanding the results. The detailed descriptions of the different molecular representations and models are helpful.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors provide a reproducibility statement and promise to release code, which is crucial for the credibility and impact of the work.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Depth of Analysis:** While the domain-based analysis is a strength, the paper could benefit from a deeper investigation into *why* certain representations perform better in specific domains.  Are there particular structural properties or chemical features that are better captured by certain representations? Connecting the observed performance differences to the underlying characteristics of the representations would significantly strengthen the conclusions.
*   **Clarity on Model Architectures:** The descriptions of the Graph , SMILES , Morgan , and Descriptor models are relatively brief, particularly regarding the specific neural network architectures used. Providing more details (e.g., number of layers, activation functions, loss function) would allow for a more informed assessment of the results. The Appendix helps, but could be more integrated into the main paper.
*   **Statistical Significance:** While the paper presents error values, a more rigorous statistical analysis (e.g., hypothesis testing) would strengthen the claims about the relative performance of different representations. Standard deviations are provided, but formal testing would be more convincing.
*   **Overclaiming:** The paper sometimes overclaims the impact of its findings. For example, the statement that the web application enables users to "find the CDRP models better suited for drugs having specific molecular properties" might be a bit strong, given the limitations of the models and the inherent complexity of drug response prediction.
*   **Missing important references:** The paper fails to acknowledge and cite key works related to Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) and the role of feature selection in drug discovery. QSAR is foundational work in relating molecular structure to biological activity.
*   **Missing connection to established concepts:** The paper focuses on prediction error based on descriptor domains but doesn't explicitly connect this concept to the well-established idea of "applicability domain" in QSAR/cheminformatics. The analysis essentially explores the applicability domain of the models with respect to certain descriptors. Framing the work in this context could enhance its impact.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Incorporate Deeper Analysis:** Investigate the underlying reasons for the observed performance differences in specific descriptor domains. Analyze the structural properties of drugs that are well-predicted vs. poorly predicted by different representations. This could involve techniques like feature importance analysis or visualization of learned representations.
*   **Provide More Architectural Details:** Include more specific details about the neural network architectures used in the custom models. This will allow readers to better understand the results and potentially replicate the experiments.
*   **Conduct Statistical Testing:** Perform statistical tests to compare the performance of different representations and models. This will provide more convincing evidence for the claims made in the paper.
*   **Refine the Claims:** Tone down any overclaims about the impact of the findings and acknowledge the limitations of the models and the complexity of drug response prediction.
*   **Include relevant QSAR/cheminformatics citations:** Add references to QSAR methodology and the concept of applicability domain.
*   **Expand on Model Representation Deficiencies:** The investigation of GATS1Z, C3SP3, SlogP_VSA4, and JGI2 is promising. Could a domain expert be consulted to provide insights on how these descriptors relate to drug action? Explain *why* a model might be struggling with these particular descriptors.
*    **Address potentially missing references and terminology:** A thorough review of the relevant literature in drug discovery would be beneficial. The term “quantal response equilibrium” is NOT relevant to the paper.

**Overall:**

This is a valuable and well-executed study that contributes to the field of drug response prediction. The domain-based model comparison is a novel and insightful approach. By addressing the weaknesses outlined above, the authors can significantly strengthen the paper and increase its impact on the ICLR community and beyond. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
