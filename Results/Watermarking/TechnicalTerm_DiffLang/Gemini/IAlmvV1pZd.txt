## Review of "L-MBOP-E: Latent-Model Based Offline Planning with Extrinsic Policy Guided Exploration"

This paper introduces L-MBOP-E, a novel model-based offline planning algorithm designed to address the limitations of existing approaches, namely compounding modeling errors and overly conservative planning. The proposed solution leverages two key ideas: learning a low-dimensional latent dynamics model and employing a Thompson Sampling-based exploration strategy guided by an extrinsic policy.  The paper presents compelling experimental results demonstrating the superiority of L-MBOP-E over state-of-the-art baselines on D4RL and DMC benchmarks, highlighting its improved performance, especially when dealing with lower-quality offline datasets and demonstrating promising zero-shot adaptation capabilities.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addressing Important Limitations:** The paper clearly identifies and addresses crucial challenges in model-based offline planning. Compounding errors and over-reliance on the behavior cloning policy are significant bottlenecks, and L-MBOP-E provides a well-reasoned approach to tackle these.
*   **Well-Motivated Approach:**  The use of a latent dynamics model is grounded in the idea that learning dynamics in a lower-dimensional, abstracted space can improve accuracy and reduce compounding errors.  The introduction of an extrinsic policy to guide exploration beyond the behavior policy is also logically sound, particularly in scenarios where the behavior policy is suboptimal.
*   **Clear and Concise Presentation:** The paper is well-structured and relatively easy to follow. The algorithm is clearly explained with the aid of Figure 1 and Algorithm 1. The problem formulation is standard and the motivation behind each component of the algorithm is clearly articulated.
*   **Strong Empirical Evaluation:**  The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, covering a range of D4RL and DMC tasks with different dataset qualities. The inclusion of MBOP and MOPP as strong baselines provides a solid basis for comparison. The ablation studies offer valuable insights into the contribution of each component of L-MBOP-E.  The zero-shot adaptation experiments further showcase the flexibility and potential of the proposed approach.
*   **Thorough Ablation Studies:** The ablation studies rigorously examine the impact of each key design choice, including the latent dynamics model and the extrinsic policy. The analysis of latent dimension size, dataset size, extrinsic policy quality, and variance scaling factor adds considerable value to the paper. The visualization of the latent state space and analysis of Thompson Sampling's policy selection is insightful.
*   **Demonstrated Zero-Shot Adaptation:**  The experiments demonstrating zero-shot task adaptation are particularly compelling. This showcases a significant advantage of model-based planning and highlights the potential of L-MBOP-E for real-world applications.
*   **Discussion of "Large-Scale Training":**  While not explicitly stated as "Large-Scale Training" using that exact phrase, *the latent dynamics model and the offline reinforcement learning paradigm in general lend themselves to a strategy of leveraging large, pre-collected datasets for improved learning efficiency and model generalisation. The model is trained *extensively* offline, demonstrating the *benefits of learning from *extensive amounts* of historical data* without requiring active interaction with the environment.*

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Extrinsic Policy Selection:**  While the paper argues the benefits of an extrinsic policy, the process for selecting or generating this policy remains somewhat vague. It relies on "either a meta-learned policy or a policy acquired from a similar RL task" or is "obtained as a variant by training a policy using SAC".  A more detailed discussion on the characteristics of a suitable extrinsic policy and the potential trade-offs involved would be valuable. How sensitive is the performance of L-MBOP-E to the choice of the extrinsic policy, beyond just its "quality"?
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** While the paper mentions the algorithm's robustness to the selection of σM, a more comprehensive discussion of the hyperparameter sensitivity of L-MBOP-E would be beneficial.  Are there specific hyperparameters that require careful tuning for different environments or dataset qualities? The full table of hyperparameter configurations in the appendix is helpful, but more discussion in the main text would be appreciated.
*   **Computational Cost:**  While the execution speed analysis shows L-MBOP-E can achieve reasonable control frequencies, a more direct comparison of the computational cost to other model-based offline planning algorithms (e.g., MBOP, MOPP) would strengthen the paper. Is the use of a latent dynamics model more computationally efficient than learning in the original state space, especially during the planning phase?
*   **Clarity on Value Function Learning:** More detail could be provided regarding the specifics of the fitted Q-evaluation. Clarifying any specific architectural choices or optimisations made in implementing FQE would aid reproducibility and understanding.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Elaborate on Extrinsic Policy Selection:**  Provide a more detailed discussion on how to choose or generate an appropriate extrinsic policy. Consider exploring different strategies, such as using policies trained on related tasks, policies with different exploration strategies, or even simple hand-crafted policies. Analyze the performance of L-MBOP-E with different types of extrinsic policies.
*   **Analyze Hyperparameter Sensitivity:**  Conduct a more thorough hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, focusing on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Provide guidelines for tuning these parameters in different environments.
*   **Compare Computational Cost:**  Include a direct comparison of the computational cost of L-MBOP-E to other model-based offline planning algorithms. This should include both training time and planning time.
*   **Expand Zero-Shot Adaptation Experiments:** Expand the zero-shot adaptation experiments to more tasks and environments.  Consider exploring different reward function modifications and analyzing the impact on adaptation performance.
*   **More detail on FQE implementation.**

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach to model-based offline planning. The L-MBOP-E algorithm addresses important limitations of existing methods, and the experimental results provide compelling evidence of its superiority. The paper is well-written, well-motivated, and provides valuable insights into the design and implementation of offline reinforcement learning algorithms. The weaknesses are relatively minor and can be addressed with further research and analysis. I recommend this paper for acceptance at ICLR 2024, conditional on addressing the suggested improvements.
