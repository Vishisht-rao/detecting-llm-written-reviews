## Review of "HUREF: HUman-REadable Fingerprint FOR Large Language Models"

**Overall Impression:**

This paper presents an interesting and novel approach to the increasingly important problem of copyright protection for Large Language Models (LLMs). The core idea of generating a human-readable fingerprint, specifically a dog image, based on invariant terms derived from model parameters, is creative and potentially effective. The paper is generally well-written and clearly explains the methodology. However, the paper would benefit from more rigorous evaluation and a more thorough discussion of potential limitations and future directions. The core idea is strong, and the presentation is solid, but the validation could be improved.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The approach of using invariant terms and StyleGAN2 to generate human-readable fingerprints is highly original and distinguishes this work from existing watermarking and detection techniques.
*   **Practicality:** The method aims to identify base models without requiring access to model parameters in a black-box setting after the fingerprint has been generated, addressing a key challenge in LLM copyright protection. The scheme as illustrated in Appendix B, showing how to generate and make public the images is promising and clearly presented.
*   **Invariance to Training:** The claim that the fingerprint remains invariant to various training steps like SFT, RLHF, and continued pretraining is significant and well-supported by the experimental results.
*   **Human Readability:** The use of dog images makes the fingerprint easily interpretable and accessible to a wider audience, potentially simplifying the process of base model identification.
*   **Clarity of Presentation:** The paper is well-structured and explains the technical details of the approach in a relatively clear and understandable manner.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Evaluation:** While the paper presents cosine similarity metrics and visual comparisons of dog images, a more quantitative evaluation is needed. Consider a *classification experiment* to see if an algorithm could use the images to classify the underlying LLM (a la transfer learning or fine tuning a CNN on the dog images) to see quantitatively how separable they are.
*   **Lack of Latent communication Discussion:** The paper mentions that is human readable but misses the most critical component which is the ability to communicate *latent* data through the image. How many bits of information can we store in the image with a specified confidence/accuracy. Does the model support arbitrary communications/fingerprints of the LLM or does it simply tell you which of the options in Figure 6 it is closest too?
*   **Robustness Against Attacks:** The paper analyzes potential weight rearrangement attacks, but doesn't deeply consider adversarial attacks specifically crafted to fool the fingerprinting model *after* it is trained. A deeper investigation into the security of the fingerprints against deliberate manipulation would be valuable.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The selection of tokens for `X_hat` seems important. How sensitive are the results to the choice of the 'K' value (number of tokens). Are there other considerations in token selection beyond rarity? Are the identified least frequent tokens different across different models with extended vocabularies?
*   **Scalability:**  How does the performance of the fingerprinting method scale to larger and more complex LLMs? Are the invariant terms and StyleGAN2 generator still effective in capturing the unique characteristics of extremely large models? While Section 5.3 addresses different sized models, it does so superficially.
*   **StyleGAN2 Reliance:** Using an off-the-shelf StyleGAN2 pretrained on dogs might introduce biases. Consider training the StyleGAN or a similar architecture on a different dataset or exploring other generative models to ensure the fingerprinting approach is not overly dependent on the specific characteristics of dog images. Or, train it on multiple datasets or include different images to avoid biases.
*   **Limited Related Work:**  While the paper covers relevant literature, it could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of alternative LLM watermarking and provenance tracking techniques, especially those emerging recently.
*   **Limited Failure Mode Analysis:** When and why would the method fail? What kinds of attacks might render a fingerprint useless? What about models that are combinations of existing models? A discussion of limitations would strengthen the paper.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Quantitative Evaluation:** Supplement the visual comparisons with quantitative metrics, such as classification accuracy of identifying base models from their fingerprints, or an information theoretic measure of how much data is latent inside the dog image.
*   **Attack Analysis:**  Include an analysis of potential adversarial attacks that could manipulate the invariant terms or generated dog images to obfuscate the true base model.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Provide a more detailed discussion of the impact of hyperparameters like `K` on the performance and robustness of the method.
*   **Scalability Study:**  Investigate the scalability of the approach to larger and more complex LLMs, potentially with a limited set of experiments on models with different sizes.
*   **Alternative Generative Models:** Briefly explore the use of other generative models beyond StyleGAN2 to ensure the method is not overly dependent on the specific characteristics of dog images.
*   **More Detailed Implementation Details:** Provide additional details on the implementation of the convolutional encoder and the training process.
*   **Broader Literature Review:** Expand the related work section to include a more comprehensive discussion of alternative LLM watermarking and provenance tracking techniques.
*   **Discussion on negative societal impacts:** Include the ethical considerations, and the potential impacts of LLM watermarking as well as potential misuses of the method.

**Minor Comments:**

*   "continue pretrained" should be "continued pretraining". Fix instances throughout the paper.
*   In Table 1, clarify what "PCS" and "ICS" stand for in the table caption.
*   The appendix names and format should be checked for consistency

**Conclusion:**

The paper presents a promising approach to LLM copyright protection using human-readable fingerprints. The idea is novel and potentially practical. While the paper would benefit from a more thorough evaluation and a deeper discussion of potential limitations, it represents a valuable contribution to the field and is worthy of consideration for acceptance to ICLR 2024, pending revisions that address the concerns raised in this review. With these revisions the paper could be a spotlight.
