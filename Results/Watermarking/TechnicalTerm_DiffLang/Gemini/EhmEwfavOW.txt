**Review: HoloNets: Spectral Convolutions Do Extend to Directed Graphs**

**Summary:**

This paper challenges the conventional wisdom that spectral convolutional networks are restricted to undirected graphs. The authors, Koke and Cremers, introduce HoloNets, a novel framework leveraging the holomorphic functional calculus to extend spectral convolutions to directed graphs.  The core idea is to move beyond the traditional reliance on the graph Fourier transform and instead define spectral convolutional filters as learnable functions applied to characteristic operators using the holomorphic functional calculus.  The paper provides a frequency-response interpretation, analyzes the influence of the basis used to express filters, and discusses the interplay with characteristic operators.  Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on heterophilic node classification and show improved robustness to topological perturbations.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The paper addresses a significant limitation in the graph learning field by extending spectral methods to directed graphs. This opens up new possibilities for applying spectral techniques to a wider range of real-world problems.  The theoretical justification based on the holomorphic functional calculus is sound and well-motivated.
*   **Strong Theoretical Foundation:** The paper provides a rigorous mathematical treatment, grounding the approach in graph signal processing and complex analysis. The derivations are detailed, and the key theorems are clearly stated. The frequency-response interpretation provides valuable insights into the behavior of the proposed filters.
*   **Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation:** The paper presents a thorough experimental evaluation across multiple datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of HoloNets. The results show state-of-the-art performance on heterophilic node classification, outperforming existing methods designed for both undirected and directed graphs. The experiments on graph regression and scale-insensitivity provide compelling evidence for the robustness of the approach.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors emphasize reproducibility by providing complete mathematical definitions, detailed experimental setups, hyperparameter settings, and publicly available code. This greatly enhances the value and impact of the work.
* **Clear Problem Definition**: The introduction clearly outlines the limitations of existing spectral methods on directed graphs and motivates the need for a new approach.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity and Accessibility:** While mathematically rigorous, the paper is dense and may be challenging for readers without a strong background in graph signal processing and complex analysis. Some concepts could be explained more intuitively to improve accessibility. The notation, while thorough, can be overwhelming at times. Specifically, the connections to objectives that might not be decomposable across graph structures (a point often encountered in real-world graph learning but not explicitly discussed) could be better highlighted. While the paper demonstrates strong empirical results, a discussion of how HoloNets address the challenges posed by **non-decomposable objectives**, a common issue, would strengthen the paper. *It would benefit from a citation to works that specifically address learning with such objectives, even if only to contrast with the current approach.*
*   **Limited Discussion of Computational Complexity:** While the authors provide some discussion of computational complexity in the appendix, a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of HoloNets compared to existing methods would be valuable.  Specifically, a breakdown of the time and memory requirements for different network configurations and dataset sizes would be helpful.
*   **Ablation Studies:**  While the paper provides strong overall results, further ablation studies could provide a better understanding of the contribution of individual components of HoloNets. For example, an ablation study varying the number of Faber polynomials or comparing different basis functions would be insightful.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Add Intuitive Explanations:** Include more intuitive explanations of key concepts, such as the holomorphic functional calculus and the frequency-response interpretation. Use diagrams and examples to illustrate the main ideas.
*   **Streamline Notation:** Simplify the notation where possible to improve readability. Consider using a glossary of terms and symbols.
*   **Expand on Computational Complexity:** Provide a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of HoloNets, including time and memory requirements for different network configurations and dataset sizes.
*   **Include Further Ablation Studies:** Conduct additional ablation studies to assess the contribution of individual components of HoloNets.
*   **Discuss Non-Decomposable Objectives:** Explicitly address the challenges posed by non-decomposable objectives in graph learning and discuss how HoloNets might address these challenges. Cite relevant works on learning with non-decomposable objectives.

**Overall Score:**

8/10

**Recommendation:**

Accept. This is a high-quality paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of graph learning. The theoretical foundation is strong, the experimental results are compelling, and the reproducibility is excellent. While the paper could benefit from improved clarity and a more detailed analysis of computational complexity, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. The extension of spectral convolutions to directed graphs is a significant advance that has the potential to impact a wide range of applications.
