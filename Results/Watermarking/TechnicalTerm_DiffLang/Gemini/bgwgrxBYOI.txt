## Review of "DEEPPDE SOLVERS FOR SUBGRID MODELLING AND OUT-OF-DISTRIBUTION GENERALIZATION"

This paper tackles a crucial challenge in climate and weather modeling (CWM): developing machine learning (ML) models for subgrid modeling that exhibit out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization and respect physical constraints. The authors propose a novel architecture inspired by the structure of PDE solution operators, aiming to overcome limitations of existing ML models in CWM.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addressing a relevant problem:** The paper addresses a significant and timely problem in CWM. Traditional ML methods often struggle with OOD generalization and adherence to physical principles, hindering their adoption in critical applications like climate modeling.
*   **Novel architecture:** The proposed architecture, grounded in principles of locality, stability, linearity, and a memory-less recurrence, is a valuable contribution.  The design incorporates domain knowledge of PDE solvers, specifically the heat equation, which is a smart approach to improving generalization. Constraining the learned coefficients using a scaled sigmoid function to ensure stability is a particularly insightful design choice.
*   **Clear problem definition:** The paper clearly defines the problem setup, including the PDE problem, ML problem definition, and the data generation process. The explicit definition of OOD data as having a different Fourier spectrum is helpful for understanding the scope of the work.
*   **Strong experimental results:** The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed architecture over standard FCN and ConvN baselines. The model exhibits superior OOD generalization performance, maintaining accuracy on data with different Fourier spectra where the baselines fail. The ablation study on data complexity further strengthens this claim.
*   **Physically interpretable model:**  By explicitly building in constraints to match PDE solution operators, the authors have designed a physically interpretable model. While "physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)" is not explicitly mentioned as a related work, the core idea of using physics to guide the training is present and could be further discussed.
*   **Good Discussion of Related Work:** The Related Work section does a reasonable job of covering different types of PDE solvers, physics-informed methods, and homogenization techniques. It also highlights how this work differs from those approaches.
*   **Clear writing:** The paper is well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the methodology and results. The figures are well-labeled and contribute to the clarity of the presentation.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Scope of PDE:**  While the heat equation is a good starting point, the paper's reliance on a single, relatively simple PDE limits the generalizability of the findings.  The authors acknowledge this in the introduction, but it's still a significant limitation.  The model's architecture is explicitly tailored to the heat equation. How well does this transfer to advection-diffusion or even more complex PDEs?
*   **Simplicity of Baseline Models:** The FCN and ConvN baselines, while simple, might not be representative of state-of-the-art ML models used in CWM.  Exploring more sophisticated architectures or incorporating techniques like attention mechanisms might provide a more challenging comparison.
*   **Overclaims of Theoretical Grounding:** The claim that the model is "grounded in theory" might be slightly overstated. While the model incorporates PDE-inspired elements, a more rigorous theoretical analysis of its convergence properties or generalization bounds would strengthen this aspect.
*   **Lack of Specific Justification for Fourier Spectrum Choice:**  While the Fourier spectrum is a valid way to generate OOD data, the specific choice of spectra and how they relate to real-world climate data could be discussed in more detail.  Why were these particular spectra chosen? What do they represent physically?
*   **Limited Discussion of Computational Cost:** While parameter count is discussed, a deeper dive into the computational cost (training and inference) of the proposed architecture compared to baselines is warranted. This is crucial for practical applications in CWM.
*  **Missing reference to Teacher-Student Training:** This methodology directly mirrors concepts from "**teacher-student training**", where a high-resolution (fine-grid) "teacher" model guides the training of a low-resolution (coarse-grid) "student" model.  The authors should cite relevant literature on teacher-student learning and acknowledge the connection. Omitting this key concept undermines the originality of the approach and fails to situate the work properly within the broader machine learning literature. Relevant citations should include seminal papers on model compression and distillation techniques.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand the scope of PDE experiments:** Include experiments with more complex PDEs relevant to CWM, such as advection-diffusion equations or simplified versions of the Navier-Stokes equations.
*   **Compare against more advanced ML baselines:**  Consider incorporating more sophisticated ML architectures or techniques commonly used in CWM, such as UNets or Graph Neural Networks, to provide a more challenging comparison.
*   **Provide a more rigorous theoretical analysis:** If possible, explore theoretical properties of the proposed architecture, such as convergence guarantees or generalization bounds.
*   **Justify the Fourier spectrum choices and link to climate data:**  Provide a more detailed justification for the choice of Fourier spectra and how they relate to real-world climate data. Discuss the limitations of this OOD definition.
*   **Discuss computational cost in more detail:** Include a more thorough discussion of the computational cost of the proposed architecture, including training and inference time, and compare it to the baselines.
*   **Explicitly mention "teacher-student training" and cite relevant literature:** Acknowledge the connection to **teacher-student training** paradigms, citing key works on model compression and distillation. Frame the fine-grid solver as the "teacher" and the coarse-grid model as the "student."
*   **Acknowledge and discuss Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs):** While the architecture differs from standard PINNs, the underlying philosophy of incorporating physics into the model is similar. Acknowledging this connection and discussing the differences would strengthen the paper.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a promising approach to developing ML models for subgrid modeling in CWM that exhibit OOD generalization and respect physical constraints. The proposed architecture is novel and the experimental results are convincing.  Addressing the weaknesses outlined above and including relevant citations on "teacher-student training" and considering the implications of Physics-Informed Neural Networks would significantly enhance the paper's impact and solidify its contribution to the field.
