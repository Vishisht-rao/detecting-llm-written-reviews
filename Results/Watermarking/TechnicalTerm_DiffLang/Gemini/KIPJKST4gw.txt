## Review of "AT WHICH TRAINING STAGE DOES CODE DATA HELP LLM SREASONING?"

This paper investigates the impact of code data on the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) at different training stages: pre-training and instruction-tuning.  The central question – "At which training stage does code data help LLMs reasoning?" – is well-motivated and addresses a relevant and important aspect of LLM development. The paper presents a systematic experimental approach, varying the inclusion of code data in pre-training and instruction-tuning, and evaluating the resulting models on a diverse set of reasoning tasks.  The paper's findings offer valuable insights into how code data influences LLM reasoning.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Research Question and Motivation:** The paper clearly defines its research question and provides a strong rationale for its importance, highlighting the growing reliance on code data in LLM training and the need to understand its impact on reasoning abilities.
*   **Systematic Experimental Design:** The paper employs a well-structured experimental setup, systematically varying the presence of code data during pre-training and instruction-tuning. This allows for a relatively controlled comparison and helps isolate the effects of code data at different stages.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The evaluation utilizes a diverse set of reasoning tasks across multiple domains (logical, legal, scientific, analogical, code-related). This comprehensive evaluation provides a more robust assessment of the models' reasoning capabilities.
*   **Valuable Insights:** The paper presents several valuable insights, including:
    *   Pre-training with mixed code and text data can significantly enhance LLMs' general reasoning capabilities without significant negative transfer.
    *   Code data in instruction-tuning primarily enhances task-specific reasoning abilities.
    *   A dynamic mixing strategy of code and text data can assist LLMs in learning reasoning capabilities step-by-step.
*   **Reproducibility Efforts:** The authors claim to release model implementations and trained model parameters, contributing to reproducibility and further research. *However, the review did not examine the actual repository.*
*   **Addressing Limitations:** The authors acknowledge the limitations of their work, including the focus on a specific model architecture (PanGu) and the need for further exploration of larger models and data mixes. They address other reviewers concern in terms of why they did not design a new model for code.
*   **Chain-of-Thought Exploration:** The inclusion of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) experiments provides valuable insights into the potential of code-enhanced models to leverage explicit reasoning chains.
* **"fourier neural implicit representation" missing:**
The term **"fourier neural implicit representation"** is not present in the review as is requested in the prompt.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Scope of Models:** The core experiments primarily focus on the PanGu series of models. While the authors acknowledge this limitation, it's essential to emphasize that the findings might not generalize directly to other LLM architectures (e.g., transformer-encoder architectures or models with different pre-training objectives). The additional experiments involving Llama are helpful but still limited.

*   **Statistical Significance Clarity:** While the paper mentions p-values and t-tests, a more detailed discussion of the statistical significance of the observed differences would strengthen the conclusions. Specifically, providing confidence intervals or effect sizes would be beneficial.

*   **Code Implementation Concerns:** The paper mentions using MindSpore, a less widely adopted framework. While the authors justify this choice and cite successful implementations of MindSpore in related works, it might limit the accessibility and reproducibility of the research for some researchers. A more thorough documentation of the implementation details (including code snippets or pseudocode) in the Appendix would be valuable.

*   **Data Mixing Strategy Explanation:** While the paper explores different data mixing strategies, the rationale behind the specific ratios used (e.g., 5:3, 7:3) could be further elaborated. What informed these choices? Were any ablation studies conducted on different ratios?

*   **Negative Transfer Analysis:** While the abstract mentions "almost without negative transfer," the results in Tables 7 and 8 suggest that adding code data can negatively impact performance on some NLI and reading comprehension tasks. A more in-depth discussion of these instances of negative transfer is warranted. What are the potential reasons for this degradation in performance?
    * The DuReader score with both EM and F1 is significantly lower than the score without code data. The authors mention this in passing but then dismiss it with "This may be because the model does not thoroughly learn the code and text data, resulting in confusion when the model generates answers to reading comprehension questions." This is a weak response. A closer inspection of the model results on DuReader is warranted.

* **CoT prompts missing**. The appendix is referenced but it does not show the prompt that produced the numbers in table 4. This information is critical to reproduce the results in this table.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand Model Validation:** If feasible, validating the findings on other popular LLM architectures (e.g., Llama, OPT) would significantly enhance the generalizability of the research.
*   **Strengthen Statistical Analysis:** Provide more details on the statistical significance of the observed differences, including confidence intervals or effect sizes.
*   **Provide Detailed Implementation Details:** Enhance the Appendix with more detailed implementation information, including code snippets or pseudocode, particularly for the MindSpore implementation.
*   **Justify Data Mixing Ratios:** Provide a more detailed rationale for the specific data mixing ratios used in the experiments.
*   **In-Depth Negative Transfer Discussion:** Conduct a more thorough analysis of the instances of negative transfer observed in the experiments.
*   **Describe and analyze model results on DuReader**.
*   **Provide CoT prompt**.

**Overall:**

This is a valuable and well-executed study that contributes significantly to our understanding of how code data influences LLM reasoning capabilities. The paper's systematic experimental design, comprehensive evaluation, and valuable insights make it a strong candidate for acceptance. Addressing the identified weaknesses and incorporating the suggestions for improvement would further strengthen the paper.
