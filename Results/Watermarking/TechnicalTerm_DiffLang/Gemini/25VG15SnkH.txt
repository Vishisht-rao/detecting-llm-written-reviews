**Review: United WeTrain, Divided WeFail! Representation Learning for Time Series by Pretraining from 75 Datasets at Once**

**Summary:**

This paper challenges the common belief that multi-dataset pretraining is ineffective for time series data.  The authors introduce XIT, a novel self-supervised contrastive pretraining approach that leverages a diverse collection of unlabeled time series datasets to learn a general-purpose encoder.  XIT incorporates XD-MixUp (a cross-dataset MixUp interpolation method) and SICC (Soft Interpolation Contextual Contrasting) loss within the TS-TCC framework.  The empirical results demonstrate that XIT outperforms supervised training and other self-supervised pretraining methods, particularly in low-data regimes, supporting the claim that effective multi-dataset pretraining for time series is indeed possible.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The paper directly addresses a perceived limitation in the time series representation learning field. The idea of effectively pretraining on a large, diverse collection of time series datasets is innovative and has significant potential impact.  The XD-MixUp and SICC loss components are also novel contributions.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and organized.  The introduction clearly motivates the problem and outlines the proposed solution. The method section provides a detailed explanation of XIT's components, including XD-MixUp and the SICC loss. The algorithm description in the appendix is helpful.
*   **Empirical Evaluation:** The experiments are comprehensive and well-designed. The authors compare XIT against several strong baselines, including TS-TCC, TF-C, TS2Vec, TNC, and T-Loss, across multiple datasets.  The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the contribution of each component of XIT.  The use of AUROC and Macro F1 scores is appropriate for handling imbalanced datasets. The statistical significance testing (CD diagrams) strengthens the conclusions.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors emphasize reproducibility and provide a link to their code. They also detail the datasets used, architecture, hyperparameters, and training procedures. This is commendable and increases the credibility of the work.
*   **Addressing a Common Misconception:** The paper persuasively argues against the notion that multi-dataset pretraining is inherently unsuitable for time series, presenting evidence to the contrary.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **ECG Performance:** The ECG results in Table 1 are somewhat concerning. XIT's performance is significantly lower than the supervised baseline. While improvements are seen as more datasets are added, the initial drop warrants further investigation and discussion. Is there a fundamental incompatibility between ECG data and the other pretraining datasets, or is there a hyperparameter issue specific to ECG?
*   **Computational Cost:** The paper touches upon the computational cost of considering all possible combinations within a mini-batch but doesn't fully address the overall computational burden of XIT, especially when pretraining on 75 datasets.  A more detailed analysis of the pretraining time and resource requirements would be beneficial. How does the pretraining time scale with the number of datasets?
*   **Limited Multivariate Evaluation:** The paper focuses primarily on univariate time series. While the authors mention that the method can be extended to multivariate tasks, a more concrete evaluation on multivariate datasets would strengthen the paper's generalizability.
*   **Clarity on Data Mixing:** In section 2.1, the explanation of how pairs are selected for interpolation within a mini-batch could be clarified further. The statement "Since a batch of size B does not contain duplicate time series..." seems like an assumption that might not always hold. What happens if there *are* duplicates in the mini-batch?
*   **Justification for Specific Augmentations:** The choice of "magnitude scaling" as a weak augmentation and "permutation-and-jitter" as a strong augmentation should be justified more explicitly. Are these augmentations particularly well-suited for the types of time series datasets used in the experiments? A brief discussion of why these augmentations were chosen over other possibilities would be helpful.
*   **Risk-Return Tradeoff Discussion:** The paper could benefit from framing the multi-dataset pretraining problem in terms of a **risk-return tradeoff**. The potential "return" is a more general and robust representation, leading to better performance on diverse downstream tasks, especially in low-data settings. However, the "risk" is the possibility of negative transfer, where pretraining on dissimilar datasets degrades performance. The XD-MixUp and SICC loss can be viewed as mechanisms to mitigate this risk by promoting shared latent representations and ensuring contextual consistency across datasets. Further clarification on the performance gains obtained from combining the various target domains would solidify the argument, explicitly stating how it is better for the model to learn to solve different classes of problems in the same latent space.
*   **Visualisation of the embeddings:** Figure 6 is very small and is difficult to interperet. It would be useful if it were larger and the dataset name displayed.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Investigate and Explain ECG Performance:** Dedicate more attention to the ECG results. Analyze potential reasons for the lower performance and discuss strategies to improve it.
*   **Address Computational Cost:** Provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of XIT, including pretraining time and resource requirements. Consider exploring techniques to reduce the computational overhead.
*   **Include Multivariate Evaluation:** Include experiments on multivariate time series datasets to demonstrate the generalizability of XIT.
*   **Clarify Data Mixing Procedure:** Clarify the data mixing procedure in Section 2.1, addressing the potential presence of duplicate time series in mini-batches.
*   **Justify Augmentation Choices:** Provide a more explicit justification for the choice of augmentations used in the experiments.
*   **Explicitly Discuss Risk-Return Tradeoff:** Incorporate a discussion of the risk-return tradeoff associated with multi-dataset pretraining, framing the XD-MixUp and SICC loss as risk mitigation strategies.
*   **Increase figure Size:** Increase the size of Figure 6 so it is easily legible.

**Overall Recommendation:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and promising approach to time series representation learning. The empirical results are compelling, and the paper is generally well-written and reproducible. While there are some areas for improvement, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, pending addressing the suggestions for improvement. I think the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.

**Confidence:**

High. I have experience reviewing papers in representation learning and time series analysis.
