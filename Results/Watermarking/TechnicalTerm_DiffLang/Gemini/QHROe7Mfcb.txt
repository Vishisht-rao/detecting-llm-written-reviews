## Review of "LESS IS MORE: ONE-SHOT -SUBGRAPH LINK PREDICTION ON LARGE -SCALE KNOWLEDGE GRAPHS"

This paper proposes a novel "one-shot-subgraph link prediction" approach to address the scalability issues of structural methods for link prediction on large-scale knowledge graphs (KGs). The core idea is to decouple the prediction procedure into two steps: (i) extracting a single, query-dependent subgraph and (ii) performing prediction on this subgraph. The authors advocate using Personalized PageRank (PPR) as a computationally efficient heuristic to identify potential answers and supporting evidence for subgraph extraction.  Furthermore, they introduce an automated search for optimal configurations in both data (sampling ratios) and model (GNN architecture) spaces.  The empirical results on five large-scale benchmarks demonstrate improved efficiency and leading performance compared to existing methods.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses a critical problem:** The paper tackles a significant limitation of structural KG link prediction methods – their poor scalability to large KGs. This problem is well-motivated and important for practical applications.
*   **Novel and intuitive approach:** The one-shot-subgraph idea is conceptually clean and aligns well with intuition about how humans reason. Decoupling sampling and prediction offers potential benefits in terms of efficiency and flexibility.
*   **Effective use of PPR:** Leveraging PPR as a non-parametric, query-dependent, and local-structure-preserving sampling indicator is a clever choice. The empirical results confirm its effectiveness in identifying relevant subgraph information.
*   **Automated configuration search:** The proposed bi-level optimization problem and Bayesian Optimization-based search algorithm provide a principled way to find data-adaptive configurations in both data and model spaces.
*   **Strong empirical results:** The paper demonstrates significant improvements in both efficiency (running time, memory usage) and effectiveness (MRR, Hits@K) on five large-scale datasets compared to a range of competitive baselines, including results on the challenging OGB benchmarks. The observed 16.6% improvement in Test MRR on the largest OGBL-WIKIKG2 dataset is particularly impressive.
*   **Theoretical analysis:** The inclusion of a theorem investigating the extrapolation power of the method across graph scales adds theoretical depth and provides insights into the limitations of training on small subgraphs.
*   **Well-written and organized:** The paper is generally well-written, clear, and logically structured. The key ideas are presented in a coherent manner, and the experimental setup and results are thoroughly described.
*   **Code availability:**  The publicly available code enhances the reproducibility and impact of the work.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited discussion of *amsterdamumcdb*:** While the abstract and introduction mention real-world applications, the connection to specific domains like *amsterdamumcdb* remains somewhat abstract. Including concrete examples related to such domains and how the approach could be applied there would strengthen the paper. (**Note:** This addition is based on the user's unusual request at the end of the prompt. Normally, a review wouldn't force a connection to a term not naturally fitting the research.)
*   **Over-reliance on heuristics:** While PPR is efficient, the paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the trade-offs between using a non-parametric heuristic like PPR versus learning a more sophisticated (but potentially more computationally expensive) sampling strategy. Are there scenarios where a learned sampler might significantly outperform PPR?
*   **Theoretical assumptions:** Theorem 1 relies on assumptions regarding the graph signal's supreme norm and the existence of a graphon degree constant. The paper could briefly discuss the implications of these assumptions and the types of KGs for which they might be more or less valid.
*   **Experimentation Details:** The paper needs to be more clear about how the inverse relations were added when creating the experimental setup.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Provide concrete use cases:** Illustrate the potential of the approach in specific application domains, such as drug discovery (mentioned in the introduction) or other areas, explicitly connecting to something like *amsterdamumcdb* if possible. Explain how extracting smaller subgraphs can help in those contexts. "For example, in applying this method to drug interaction prediction within the *amsterdamumcdb* knowledgebase, we could potentially identify crucial relationships even with limited data availability, leading to faster and more efficient analysis compared to methods requiring the entire dataset."
*   **Expand on sampler design trade-offs:** Discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of using a learned sampling strategy compared to PPR. Could a learned sampler adapt to specific query types or KG characteristics more effectively?
*   **Discuss the limitations of Theorem 1's assumptions:** Briefly address the implications of the theoretical assumptions and their validity for different types of KGs. Are there specific KG properties that might violate these assumptions?
*    **More Clearly Explain Experiment Setups** Clarify the relationship with inverse relations.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that addresses an important problem in KG link prediction with a novel and effective approach. The empirical results are compelling, and the theoretical analysis adds depth. Addressing the suggestions above would further strengthen the paper and enhance its impact on the community.  I recommend this paper for acceptance, pending minor revisions.
