**Review: SteinDreamer: Variance Reduction for Text-to-3D Score Distillation via Stein Identity**

**Overall Impression:**

This paper tackles an important and challenging problem: improving the stability and convergence of score distillation methods for text-to-3D generation. The authors identify high variance in gradient estimation as a key bottleneck in existing approaches like SDS and VSD.  They propose a novel technique, Stein Score Distillation (SSD), based on Stein's identity, to construct flexible control variates for variance reduction. The approach, implemented in a pipeline called SteinDreamer, shows promising results in both object-level and scene-level generation, demonstrating improved visual quality and faster convergence. The paper is well-written, theoretically grounded, and supported by experimental results. It's a strong contribution to the field.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Problem Definition:** The paper clearly articulates the problem of high variance in score distillation and its impact on the quality and efficiency of text-to-3D generation.
*   **Theoretical Justification:** The authors provide a sound theoretical analysis, reinterpreting SDS and VSD through the lens of control variates. This provides a deeper understanding of the existing methods and motivates the proposed SSD approach.
*   **Novelty of the Approach:** The use of Stein's identity to construct control variates is a novel and elegant solution. The flexibility of SSD, allowing for arbitrary baseline functions, is a significant advantage.
*   **Effective Variance Reduction:** The experimental results consistently demonstrate that SteinDreamer reduces variance compared to SDS and VSD.
*   **Improved Visual Quality:** The generated 3D assets exhibit improved visual quality, with more detailed textures, smoother geometry, and fewer artifacts (Janus, ghosting).
*   **Faster Convergence:**  The reduced variance leads to faster convergence, reducing the computational cost of training.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written, clearly structured, and easy to follow. The figures and tables are informative.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Baseline Function Selection:** While the paper highlights the flexibility of choosing the baseline function ϕ, the selection of MiDaS as a monocular depth estimator seems somewhat ad-hoc. A more detailed explanation of why MiDaS was chosen, and a discussion of alternative baseline functions (perhaps trained end-to-end), would strengthen the paper. Are there any theoretical guidelines for choosing a good baseline function given a specific text prompt?
*   **Limited Quantitative Evaluation:** While CLIP distance is a useful metric, more comprehensive quantitative evaluation would be beneficial.  Metrics like FID or IS scores (if applicable to 3D generation) could provide a more complete picture of the performance. User studies would also be helpful.
*   **Ablation on Loss terms:** More details on the impact of the Pearson correlation loss and Cosine similarity loss would be beneficial to understand its influence on the results.

**"Large Language Model" Integration (Where Appropriate/Needed):**

The paper focuses on leveraging *pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models* for 3D generation. While the paper doesn't explicitly mention "large language models," there's an implicit connection here:

*   **Connection to Text Encoders:** The text prompt *y* is likely processed by a text encoder (e.g., CLIP's text encoder) to generate a text embedding that guides the diffusion model.  The quality of this text embedding heavily influences the final 3D result. It might be worth mentioning that recent advances in "large language models" could potentially be used to further improve the text encoding and, consequently, the quality of the generated 3D assets. For example, the paper could add a sentence like: *"Future work could explore the integration of more powerful text encoders based on recent advances in large language models to further improve the semantic alignment of the generated 3D assets with the input text prompts."*

**Specific Comments and Suggestions:**

*   **Section 4.3 (Discussion):** Expand on the discussion comparing SSD to VSD.  Quantify the computational cost savings of SSD compared to VSD in more detail.
*   **Figure 2 (Pipeline):** Add a visual representation of the learnable weights µ in the pipeline diagram for clarity.
*   **Experimental Setup:** Provide more details about the hardware and software used for the experiments.
*   **Limitations:** Add a section discussing the limitations of the proposed approach. For example, how well does SteinDreamer handle complex or ambiguous text prompts? How sensitive is it to the choice of hyperparameters?

**Conclusion:**

SteinDreamer presents a significant advancement in text-to-3D generation by addressing the critical issue of variance in score distillation. The proposed SSD method, based on Stein's identity, offers a flexible and effective approach to variance reduction, leading to improved visual quality and faster convergence. The paper is well-written and theoretically sound, making it a valuable contribution to the field. With some minor revisions and expansions, this paper is suitable for acceptance at ICLR 2024.

**Rating:**

*   Overall Score: 8 (Strong Accept)
