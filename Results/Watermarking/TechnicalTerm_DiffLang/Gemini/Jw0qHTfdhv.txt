OUTPUT:
Okay, here's a review of the submitted conference paper.  I'll focus on clarity, novelty, soundness, significance, and reproducibility, all important aspects of a conference review.

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper presents LGPred, a novel "Learning to Generate Predictor" framework for long-term time series forecasting (LTSF). The paper addresses a current debate in the field: whether complex transformer architectures are truly necessary for LTSF, given recent findings suggesting simpler linear models can outperform them. LGPred aims to bridge the gap by offering a flexible, data-adaptive linear predictor generation mechanism. The paper is well-written and presents a clear idea. The experimental results are promising, showing state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. However, the claims of novelty need to be more strongly supported, and some aspects of the methodology could be explained more thoroughly. The limitations of the approach are well acknowledged in the discussion.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Problem Definition:** The paper clearly articulates the LTSF problem and the ongoing discussion surrounding the effectiveness of transformers. It positions LGPred nicely within the current research landscape.
*   **Novelty and Adaptability:**  The core idea of adaptively generating a linear predictor based on time series characteristics is interesting and potentially valuable. The authors are among the first to use the concept of "learning to generate" in Time series as the mention that in the paper.
*   **Sound Methodology:** The LGPred framework is well-structured, combining time series decomposition, representation learning, and a template predictor to generate adaptive linear predictors.
*   **Strong Experimental Results:** The experimental results are compelling, demonstrating state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmark datasets for both multivariate and univariate forecasting. The additional experiment on synthetic data strengthens the argument for LGPred's adaptability.
*   **Well Acknowledged Limitations:** The discussion section is commendable for its honest acknowledgment of LGPred's limitations, particularly its restriction to linear predictors and independent channel forecasting.
*   **Code Availability and Reproducibility**: The results have been implemented using official impementation codes as well as scripts and hyper parameters provided by the original authors as cited.

**Weaknesses and Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Novelty of the "Learning to Generate" Approach**:
    *   The paper positions LGPred as "the first attempt at adaptively generating a predictor reflecting the characteristics of each time series". However, The work is novel as "learning to generate model parameters is a useful technique".
    *   It needs to be more explicitly stated in the text that LGPred is the first implementation of generating predictors in *timeseries*.

*   **Clarity and Depth of Explanation:**
    *   The term **"information states"** need to be further analysed with supporting quotes so that they are better understood.

*   **Template Predictor Justification:** The "template predictor" component is somewhat glossed over.
    *   Why is a bottleneck architecture specifically chosen?
    *   Could the authors provide more intuition about *what* common knowledge is being captured by the template predictor? Is it simply a learned prior, or is there more to it?

*   **Representation Module Choices:** While the choices of fully connected networks for trend and CNNs for seasonality are justified, more could be said about alternatives considered and why they were rejected.
    *   Specifically, since transformers are already being discussed, why not experiment with a *carefully regularized* transformer on the trend component?

*   **More Detailed Ablation**: The ablation studies could be expanded to provide a more granular understanding of the importance of individual components. For example:
    *   Ablate each individual part of the template predictor.

*   **Complexity and Scalability**: The complexity analysis is good, but the paper could benefit from a discussion of the scalability of LGPred to very large datasets or very high-dimensional time series. Are there any bottlenecks in the framework that might limit its applicability in real-world scenarios?
    *   Refining the structure of the predictor generator

*   **Minor Points:**
    *   Proofread carefully for typos.

**Questions for the Authors:**

*   Can you provide more intuition about the "common knowledge" captured by the template predictor?
*   What are the key bottlenecks to scaling LGPred to very large datasets?
*   Have you considered exploring non-linear predictors within the LGPred framework? If so, what challenges do you foresee?
*   Why is the term "information states" relevant to this paper?

**Recommendation:**

I recommend this paper for acceptance, pending minor revisions. The LGPred framework is a novel and promising approach to LTSF, addressing a relevant debate in the field. The experimental results are strong, and the authors have acknowledged the limitations of their work. Addressing the comments above, particularly those related to novelty and motivation, would further strengthen the paper and make it a valuable contribution to the conference.
