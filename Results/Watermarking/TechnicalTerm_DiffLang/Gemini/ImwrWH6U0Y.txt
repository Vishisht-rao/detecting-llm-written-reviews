## Review of "A Comprehensive Study of Privacy Risks in Curriculum Learning"

**Overall Impression:**

This paper presents a valuable initial investigation into the privacy implications of Curriculum Learning (CL), a widely used training technique. The authors systematically explore Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) and Attribute Inference Attacks (AIAs) against models trained with different CL strategies, providing empirical evidence of increased vulnerability to MIAs, particularly for difficult samples. The paper is well-structured, the methodology is clearly explained, and the experimental results are comprehensive.  The introduction of Diff-Cali, a difficulty-aware MIA, is a novel contribution. While the defense analysis is somewhat limited, the paper raises important questions and sets a foundation for future research in this area.  However, it would be beneficial to include some mention of content suppression, image editing or text embeddings, as this is a critical consideration for a general audience.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** This work addresses a significant gap in the literature by being the first to comprehensively study the privacy risks associated with Curriculum Learning.
*   **Thorough Evaluation:** The authors conduct extensive experiments across a range of datasets, model architectures, CL methods, and attack strategies, providing a solid empirical foundation for their findings.
*   **Clear Methodology:** The paper clearly describes the experimental setup, curriculum designs, attack implementations, and defense techniques used, making the results reproducible.
*   **Insightful Analysis:** The paper provides insightful analysis of the experimental results, linking the observed vulnerability to MIAs to the enhanced memorization of difficult samples in CL.
*   **Novel Attack (Diff-Cali):**  The introduction of Diff-Cali is a valuable contribution, leveraging difficulty scores to improve MIA performance, particularly in the low-FPR regime.
*   **Well-Structured and Written:** The paper is well-organized and written in a clear and concise manner, making it easy to understand the key contributions and findings.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Defense Analysis:** While the paper evaluates several existing defense techniques, the analysis could be more in-depth. A more thorough investigation into the effectiveness of these defenses specifically against the proposed Diff-Cali attack would be beneficial. Also, a deeper discussion on the limitations and trade-offs of each defense method is needed.
*   **Explanation of Diff-Cali Implementation:** The description of Diff-Cali's implementation in Section 4.3 could be improved. The calibration function `g(x, C, θ0)` requires more explanation, particularly the rationale behind its specific form.
*   **High DP-SGD epsilon:** The high value of epsilon used in DP-SGD raises concerns about the level of privacy achieved. A discussion on the impact of this choice and potential avenues for improvement (e.g., using automatic clipping or larger batch sizes) would be helpful.
*   **Lack of Connection to Content Suppression, Image Editing, and Text Embeddings:** The paper does not make any mention of the effect of the findings on Content Suppression, Image Editing, and Text Embeddings. Considering that there are many practical applications for the findings of the report, the lack of mentioning these points becomes a significant concern and should be rectified.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand Defense Analysis:** Provide a more in-depth analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each defense method, especially in relation to the proposed Diff-Cali attack.  Consider exploring or suggesting new defenses tailored to mitigate the privacy risks introduced by CL.
*   **Clarify Diff-Cali Implementation:** Provide a more detailed explanation of the difficulty-aware threshold calibration in Diff-Cali, including the reasoning behind the design of the function `g(x, C, θ0)`.
*   **Address DP-SGD Concerns:** Discuss the implications of the high epsilon value in DP-SGD and explore potential strategies for improving the privacy-utility trade-off. Mention recent works with stronger epsilon.
*   **Add Practical Applications:** Provide examples on how this findings may apply to Content Suppression, Image Editing, and Text Embeddings. Give examples of current systems that might be affected by this findings.
*   **Minor Edits:**
    *   Proofread for minor grammatical errors and typos.
    *   Consider adding a table summarizing the key datasets and model architectures used in the experiments.

**Specific Comments/Questions:**

*   In Section 5.2, the authors mention "enhanced memorization facilitated by specific data ordering." Could you elaborate on what specific properties of the data ordering contribute most to the enhanced memorization?
*   What are the computational overheads associated with Diff-Cali compared to the standard NN-based MIA?
*   How sensitive is Diff-Cali to the attacker's ability to accurately replicate the curriculum used during target model training?

**Conclusion:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the understanding of privacy risks in Curriculum Learning. The comprehensive evaluation, insightful analysis, and novel Diff-Cali attack demonstrate the increased vulnerability to MIAs in CL, particularly for difficult samples. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above will further strengthen the paper and increase its impact on the research community. Overall, the paper is a significant step towards raising awareness about the privacy implications of CL and developing effective defenses.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend this paper for acceptance with minor revisions. Addressing the points mentioned above will significantly improve the quality and impact of the work.
