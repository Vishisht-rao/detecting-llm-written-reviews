## Review of "RADAR SPECTRA -LANGUAGE MODEL FOR AUTOMOTIVE SCENE PARSING"

This paper presents a novel approach to automotive scene parsing by developing a radar spectra-language model (RSLM). The authors leverage the strengths of radar sensors (low cost, long range, weather resilience, and direct velocity measurements) and address the challenge of interpreting raw radar spectra by aligning them with a vision-language model (VLM). The paper proposes a training methodology to overcome the scarcity of labeled radar data and fine-tunes the VLM for the automotive domain. The experiments demonstrate the potential of RSLM for scene retrieval and improved performance on downstream tasks like object detection and free space segmentation.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The core idea of creating a radar spectra-language model is novel and promising. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first attempt to bridge the gap between raw radar data and natural language understanding in the context of autonomous driving.
*   **Addressing Data Scarcity:** The approach of leveraging a pre-trained VLM and matching its embedding space to radar spectra is an effective way to overcome the lack of large labeled radar datasets.
*   **Fine-tuning for Automotive Domain:** Recognizing the limitations of off-the-shelf VLMs in automotive scenes, the authors propose and evaluate a fine-tuning strategy using generated captions. This demonstrates a practical understanding of the problem domain and a commitment to improving performance.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed RSLM, including:
    *   Benchmarking different VLMs for automotive classification.
    *   Evaluating RSLM on scene retrieval tasks.
    *   Analyzing the impact of RSLM on downstream tasks like object detection and free space estimation.
    *   **Ablation Studies:** The ablation studies on the downstream tasks is particularly useful for understanding the contribution of each component of the proposed approach.
    *   **The paper provides a ''large-scale analysis''**, offering ''large-scale analysis'' of radar data's utility in scene understanding.

*   **Clear Writing:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The introduction clearly outlines the problem, the proposed solution, and the contributions of the work.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Dependence on VLM Quality:** The performance of the RSLM is heavily dependent on the quality of the pre-trained VLM and the generated captions used for fine-tuning. The paper acknowledges this limitation but could benefit from a more in-depth discussion on the potential failure modes and the impact of caption quality on the overall performance.
*   **Limited Generalizability:** The experiments are primarily focused on a few specific datasets (RADIal, CRUW, and nuScenes). It's unclear how well the proposed approach would generalize to other radar sensors or driving environments.
*   **Lack of Comparison with Other Radar-Specific Methods:** While the paper effectively demonstrates the benefits of incorporating language information, it lacks a direct comparison with existing state-of-the-art radar-specific methods for object detection and free space segmentation. This would help to contextualize the performance gains achieved by the RSLM.
*   **Details of Caption Generation:** While the caption generation process is described, more details regarding the segmentation model used and the criteria for generating synonymous scene modifiers would enhance reproducibility and provide a clearer understanding of the fine-tuning process.
*   **Clarity on "frozen-enc" vs. "from-scratch":** The comparison between "frozen-enc" and "from-scratch" is interesting, but the conclusion that the pre-training is as good as fully supervised learning requires further justification. The weights are initialized differently but then both are fine-tuned.  More analysis of the learned weights or features would strengthen this claim.
*   **Figure Quality:** Some figures, especially Figure 5, are difficult to read due to their small size and density of information.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand the discussion on the limitations of VLM dependence and caption generation.** Analyze the impact of caption quality on the performance of RSLM.
*   **Evaluate the generalizability of the proposed approach to other radar sensors and driving environments.** Consider experimenting with different datasets or simulated data.
*   **Include a direct comparison with state-of-the-art radar-specific methods for object detection and free space segmentation.** This will provide a clearer picture of the advantages and disadvantages of the RSLM approach.
*   **Provide more details about the segmentation model and caption generation process.**
*   **Improve the quality and readability of the figures.**
*   **Clarify the justification for the "frozen-enc" vs. "from-scratch" conclusion.** Perhaps comparing feature distributions or doing a layer-wise analysis.
*   **Discuss potential future work**, such as using object-level descriptions or exploring the use of the model for radar data generation.
*   **More discussion on the impact of weather conditions.**

**Overall Recommendation:**

This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of automotive perception by introducing a novel radar spectra-language model. While there are some weaknesses that need to be addressed, the strengths of the paper outweigh the limitations. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the points mentioned above. The authors should focus on clarifying the limitations, improving the experimental evaluation, and providing more details about the proposed methods. The ''large-scale analysis'' performed here is very promising, offering insights into ''large-scale analysis'' tasks in scene understanding.
