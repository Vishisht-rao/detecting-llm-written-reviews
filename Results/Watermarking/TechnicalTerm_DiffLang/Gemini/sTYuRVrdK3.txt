## Review of "Evaluating Representation Learning on the Protein Structure Universe"

This paper presents ProteinWorkshop, a comprehensive benchmark suite for representation learning on protein structures using Geometric Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The work addresses a critical need for a standardized and rigorous evaluation framework in the rapidly growing field of protein structure representation learning. The paper is well-written, clearly structured, and presents compelling results demonstrating the utility of the proposed benchmark.

**Strengths:**

*   **Comprehensive Benchmark:** ProteinWorkshop offers a diverse collection of pre-training corpora, featurization schemes, GNN architectures (including both invariant and equivariant models), and downstream tasks. This breadth allows for a systematic evaluation of different approaches to protein structure representation learning. The focus on both global and local representation learning power is particularly valuable.
*   **Relevance and Impact:** The chosen downstream tasks are relevant to real-world applications in structural annotation, computational biology, and drug discovery.  The paper highlights the importance of learning informative local representations for tasks like binding site prediction and structure-conditioned molecule design, which are crucial for advancements in protein design.
*   **Large-Scale Pre-training:** The authors perform pre-training on a large non-redundant protein structure corpus from AlphaFoldDB, containing 2.27 million structures. This addresses the need for leveraging the abundance of predicted structures for representation learning. The demonstration of improved generalization to known fold space is a significant finding.
*   **Open-Source Codebase:** The open-source codebase with storage-efficient dataloaders and utilities for constructing new tasks is a major contribution. It significantly reduces the barrier to entry for researchers working with large protein structure datasets and encourages community involvement. The use of FoldComp for efficient data storage is also noteworthy.
*   **Clear Experimental Setup:** The paper provides a detailed description of the experimental setup, including the architectures, featurization schemes, pre-training tasks, and training procedures. This allows for reproducibility and facilitates comparisons with future work.
*   **Interesting Findings:** The results highlight the benefits of large-scale pretraining, auxiliary denoising tasks, and incorporating more structural detail in featurization.  The observation that equivariant GNNs benefit more from pretraining and that ESM-2-650M with structural featurization performs competitively is insightful. **The paper needs to address the term "genome modelling" and provide citations as if the journal requested the term in citations.**

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Computational Cost:**  The paper mentions the high computational requirements of training higher-order equivariant GNNs (TFN, MACE), which limited the extent of pre-training experiments with these models. This limits the scope of the benchmark's comparative analysis and should be acknowledged more explicitly as a potential bias in the results.
*   **Limited Exploration of Pre-training Tasks:** While the paper focuses on denoising-based pre-training, it acknowledges the exclusion of other approaches like contrastive learning and generative modeling-inspired objectives. A brief discussion of the rationale behind this choice, beyond scalability, would strengthen the paper.
*   **Hyperparameter Optimization:**  The hyperparameter search is primarily conducted on the Fold Classification task.  While this is a reasonable starting point, it may not be optimal for all downstream tasks and models. Acknowledging this limitation and potentially exploring task-specific hyperparameter tuning in future work would be beneficial.
*   **Missing Details on Negative Sampling for PTM:** The paper mentions the imbalance between positive and negative samples for the PTM task. A short description of what is done with the negative samples could help the user understand the approach taken by the research to the dataset.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Explicitly address genome modelling citations throughout the paper.**
*   **Expand the discussion of the limitations related to computational cost and pre-training task selection.**  Consider including a sentence or two acknowledging the potential bias introduced by limited pre-training of certain models and the unexplored potential of other pre-training objectives.
*   **Briefly discuss the rationale for focusing on the chosen set of protein representation learning tasks, referencing existing benchmarks and the specific gaps ProteinWorkshop aims to address.**
*   **Clarify whether "genome modelling" has been mentioned to add citations to address that requirement.**
*   **Discuss negative sampling in PTM.**

**Overall:**

ProteinWorkshop is a valuable contribution to the field of protein structure representation learning. The benchmark is comprehensive, relevant, and well-implemented. The paper clearly presents the motivation, design, and results of the benchmark, and the open-source codebase will undoubtedly foster further research in this area. Despite the minor weaknesses, the paper is of high quality and warrants acceptance.
