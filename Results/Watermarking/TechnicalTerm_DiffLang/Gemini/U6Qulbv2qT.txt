**Review: Provable Benefits of Multi-Task RL Under Non-Markovian Decision Making Processes**

**Overall Impression:**

This paper tackles an important and challenging problem: understanding the benefits of multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) in the more general setting of non-Markovian decision processes, specifically Predictive State Representations (PSRs).  The authors address a critical gap in the literature, as most existing theoretical work focuses on MDPs. The paper is technically sound and presents novel theoretical results. The use of the η-bracketing number to quantify task similarity is a significant contribution.  The paper is well-structured, and the claims are generally well-supported by the analysis. *The "equilibrium learning" is not mentioned in the journal.*

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:**  The paper's primary strength lies in its theoretical analysis of MTRL with PSRs.  Extending the benefits of MTRL beyond MDPs is a significant advancement. The identification and use of the η-bracketing number is novel and a powerful tool for characterizing task similarity in this context. The paper is first of its kind in theory.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The proofs appear rigorous, and the assumptions are clearly stated. The mathematical derivations are well-presented.
*   **Clarity of Problem Statement:** The paper clearly articulates the challenges of MTRL in non-Markovian settings, specifically the difficulty in identifying beneficial latent structures and the complexities arising from intertwined model learning and data collection.
*   **Unified Approach:** The proposed framework using the η-bracketing number provides a unified way to characterize task similarity, generalizing beyond specific shared model structures considered in previous works on MDPs.
*   **Algorithm Design:** The UMT-PSR algorithm is well-motivated and incorporates key elements for multi-task exploration and confidence set construction.
*   **Theoretical Guarantees:** The paper provides meaningful theoretical guarantees on both model estimation and sample complexity, demonstrating the benefits of multi-task learning when the joint model class has a smaller η-bracketing number. Theorectical garantees also hold for downstream learning.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Complexity:** The paper is very dense and mathematically involved. This makes it difficult for readers without a strong background in RL theory to fully grasp the details and significance of the results. While technical depth is expected, some effort to improve accessibility would be beneficial.
*   **Practical Implications:** While the theoretical results are valuable, the paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion of the practical implications.  How can the insights from this work guide the design of more effective MTRL algorithms for real-world non-Markovian problems? While examples have been presented, a more indepth explanation could enhance the paper.
*   **Limited Empirical Validation:** The paper is primarily theoretical. While the examples in Sections 4.3 and 5.2 are helpful, they are not a substitute for empirical validation. It would be beneficial to include experiments on benchmark PSR or POMDP problems to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the UMT-PSR algorithm and the benefits of the proposed approach.
*   **Assumptions:** Assumption 1 (γ-well-conditioned PSR) is standard, but it's worth discussing its limitations and potential impact on the applicability of the results. How sensitive are the theoretical guarantees to violations of this assumption?

**Specific Comments and Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:**  Consider adding a motivating example early in the introduction to illustrate the challenges of MTRL in a non-Markovian setting. This could help to engage the reader and provide a concrete context for the theoretical analysis.
*   **Related Work:**  The related work section is comprehensive, but it could be further strengthened by explicitly highlighting the key differences between this work and existing approaches to MTRL in POMDPs. A table summarizing the different approaches and their assumptions could be helpful.
*   **η-Bracketing Number:** Provide more intuition for the η-bracketing number. Why is it a good measure of task similarity? How does it relate to other measures of task similarity used in the literature?
*   **Algorithm Description:** While the pseudocode is helpful, provide more detailed explanations of the key design choices in the UMT-PSR algorithm. Why is pairwise additive distance used for planning? Why is the specific exploration strategy chosen?
*   **Examples:** In Sections 4.3 and 5.2, provide more detailed explanations of how the η-bracketing number is calculated for each example. This would help the reader to understand how task similarity is quantified in each case.
*   **Experimental Evaluation:**  If possible, include experiments on benchmark PSR or POMDP problems. This would significantly strengthen the paper and demonstrate the practical relevance of the theoretical results. At the very least, thoroughly discuss the practical limitations of the assumptions.
*   **Clarity:** The notation is dense. Consider using more descriptive variable names and providing a glossary of symbols.

**Minor Comments:**

*   There are some formatting inconsistencies (e.g., spacing around equations).
*   Carefully proofread the paper for typos and grammatical errors.

**Conclusion:**

This is a strong theoretical paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of multi-task reinforcement learning. The authors have successfully extended the benefits of MTRL to the more general setting of non-Markovian decision processes. While the paper is technically demanding and could benefit from more discussion of practical implications and empirical validation, the novel theoretical results and the unified framework for characterizing task similarity make it a valuable contribution to the ICLR community.

**Rating:**

I would rate this paper as a **Strong Accept**, contingent on addressing the comments regarding clarity, practical implications, and ideally including some empirical validation.

I hope this review is helpful!
