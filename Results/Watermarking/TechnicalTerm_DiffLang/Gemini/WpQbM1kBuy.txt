OUTPUT:
Okay, here's a review of the paper, incorporating the requested focus on "progressive learning," even though the term isn't explicitly used by the authors. The review will highlight areas where the concept is implicitly present and suggest framing enhancements.

**Review of "Prodigy: An Expeditiously Adaptive Parameter-Free Learner"**

**Summary:**

This paper introduces Prodigy and Resetting, two novel modifications to the D-Adaptation method, aiming to improve the convergence rate in adaptive optimization. The key idea is to refine the learning rate adaptation by estimating the distance to the solution (D) more efficiently.  The authors provide theoretical analysis showing improved convergence rates compared to D-Adaptation and present extensive experimental results across a diverse set of machine learning tasks, demonstrating performance competitive with hand-tuned Adam and outperforming D-Adaptation. The work includes a complexity lower bound, showing optimality within a specific class of algorithms.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** Prodigy and Resetting represent a significant advancement in parameter-free adaptive optimization. The modifications to D-Adaptation are well-motivated and lead to demonstrably better performance.
*   **Theoretical Rigor:** The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation for the proposed methods. The convergence theorems are clearly stated and supported by detailed proofs. The lower bound analysis adds further weight to the significance of the results.
*   **Extensive Experimental Validation:** The empirical evaluation is comprehensive, covering a wide range of datasets and model architectures. The experiments convincingly demonstrate the practical benefits of Prodigy, particularly in closing the gap with hand-tuned Adam in challenging scenarios like ViT training. The inclusion of large-scale experiments (LSTM, RoBERTa, GPT, DLRM, VarNet) strengthens the paper's impact.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, although some of the theoretical sections can be dense. The algorithms are clearly presented, and the experimental setup is well-described.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Discussion of Related Work:** While the Related Work section covers relevant areas, it could benefit from a more in-depth comparison with other adaptive optimization techniques, particularly those that address non-convex optimization.
*   **Lack of Deep Dive into Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** While the 'parameter-free' aspect is highlighted, some hyperparameters are still present (e.g. beta1, beta2 in Adam version). A sensitivity analysis of these parameters (if any) would improve the reproducibility of the results.
*   **The "Progressive Learning" Aspect is Implicit, Not Explicit:**  A key area for improvement is to explicitly connect the method to the concept of "progressive learning."

**Suggestions for Improvement (Focusing on "Progressive Learning"):**

1.  **Framing and Introduction:**

    *   Reframe the problem in the introduction to emphasize the challenge of adapting to changing problem characteristics during training. For example: "In many real-world machine learning scenarios, the optimal learning rate may evolve *progressively* as the training process unfolds. Initial phases might require more exploration (larger learning rates), while later phases need finer-grained adjustments (smaller learning rates) to converge to a good solution."
    *   Add a sentence that explicitly links the adaptive nature of Prodigy to "progressive learning": "Prodigy addresses this challenge by *progressively* adapting the learning rate based on the estimated distance to the solution, allowing for a more efficient and robust training process."
    *   Cite the term "progressive learning" in the introduction and relate Prodigy as a method to achieve a progressive adaptation of the learning rate.

2.  **Discussion of Results:**

    *   Interpret the experimental results through the lens of "progressive learning." For example, when discussing the CIFAR10 results: "The improved performance of Prodigy on CIFAR10, particularly in closing the gap with Adam, can be attributed to its ability to *progressively* adjust the learning rate, allowing it to escape local optima and converge more quickly to a better solution."
    *   When discussing the step sizes, mention how Prodigy dynamically adjusts them in a "progressive" manner. For instance, "Prodigy estimates a larger step size than D-Adaptation, which helps it reach test accuracy closer to the one of Adam, showing the importance of a *progressive* learning rate schedule."

3.  **Future Work:**

    *   Suggest future research directions that explicitly explore the connection between Prodigy and "progressive learning." For example: "Future work could investigate the use of Prodigy in online learning scenarios, where the data distribution changes *progressively* over time. Additionally, exploring methods for incorporating prior knowledge or heuristics to guide the adaptation process could further enhance the performance of Prodigy in specific applications."

4.  **Related Work Section:**
*   Add citations that include "Progressive Learning". This can be methods that progressively train deep models.

**Detailed Comments:**

*   **Algorithm 1 and 2:** It would be helpful to provide a brief explanation of the intuition behind the choice of λk. While the theory allows for any non-decreasing sequence, practical guidance would be valuable.
*   **Theorem 4:** The discussion of the limitations of the lower bound is important.  Clarify why the construction only applies for small *n*.
*   **Section 6:** Mention the hardware and software used for the experiments to improve reproducibility.
*   **Appendix A:** The detailed experimental settings in the appendix are essential for reproducibility.

**Overall Recommendation:**

This is a strong paper with significant contributions to the field of adaptive optimization. The proposed methods are theoretically sound and empirically validated across a wide range of tasks. By explicitly framing the work within the context of "progressive learning" and addressing the minor weaknesses outlined above, the paper could be further strengthened and its impact amplified. I recommend acceptance, conditional on addressing the suggested improvements.
