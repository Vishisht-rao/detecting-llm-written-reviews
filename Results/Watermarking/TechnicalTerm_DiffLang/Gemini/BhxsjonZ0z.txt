## Review of "FEDOD: Federated Outlier Detection via Neural Approximation"

This paper presents FEDOD, a novel federated learning (FL) system designed for classical outlier detection (OD) algorithms. The central idea is to decompose these algorithms into basic operators and approximate their behavior using neural networks, thereby enabling privacy-preserving learning without data exchange. The paper argues that this approach overcomes the limitations of existing FL systems, which are primarily compatible with neural-network-based OD methods. The authors claim FEDOD supports over 20 popular classical OD algorithms and demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency through extensive experiments on benchmark and synthetic datasets.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The paper addresses a significant gap in the field of federated learning by extending its applicability to classical OD algorithms. The idea of decomposing OD algorithms into basic operators and approximating them with neural networks is novel and potentially impactful. The increasing importance of data privacy in OD applications further enhances the significance of this work.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The paper provides a clear and well-structured explanation of the FEDOD system. The model decomposition approach, neural network converter, and training methodology are described in detail. The justification for using convex and non-convex operator categories is also well-explained. The paper leverages the universal approximation theorem to support the viability of neural network approximation.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The experimental evaluation is extensive, using over 30 datasets and five diverse OD algorithms. The comparison with ground truth and direct baselines is appropriate for evaluating the effectiveness of FEDOD. The scalability analysis demonstrates the efficiency of FEDOD in handling larger datasets. The ablation studies provide insights into the impact of model capacity and backbone architecture.
*   **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The use of figures and tables enhances the readability and understanding of the proposed system and experimental results. The introduction clearly motivates the problem and outlines the contributions of the paper.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Discussion of Local Loss Function Design:** While the paper mentions designing local loss functions for each operator, the specifics of these loss functions, beyond the clustering example, are not elaborated upon. A more detailed explanation of how these loss functions are designed to approximate the global ground truth using only local data would significantly strengthen the paper. The link between the local loss function and the global objective requires stronger justification.
*   **Justification of Operator Decomposition:** While the paper motivates the operator decomposition approach, there is limited discussion on the criteria used for selecting and defining these basic operators. How was the specific set of operators identified, and what are the potential limitations of this decomposition? A discussion on alternative decomposition strategies and their potential impact would be beneficial.
*   **Missing Related Work: "Multimodal Evaluation" Perspective:** The related work section focuses primarily on federated learning for OD and neural approximation. However, the paper lacks a discussion of related work in **multimodal evaluation** contexts that might be relevant to the broader application of outlier detection. While not directly related to federated learning, acknowledging and situating FEDOD within a wider context of evaluation techniques for machine learning models would broaden the appeal of the paper and demonstrate a more comprehensive understanding of the field.
*   **Lack of Theoretical Guarantees:** While the paper shows empirical results, it lacks theoretical guarantees on the convergence and performance of the neural approximations. Providing some theoretical analysis, even for specific operators, would increase the credibility of the approach.
*   **Assumptions on Data Homogeneity:** The paper focuses on horizontal FL, assuming the same set of features across all agents. A brief discussion of the challenges and potential solutions for handling heterogeneous data (vertical FL) would be valuable.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand on Local Loss Function Design:** Provide a more detailed explanation of the local loss functions designed for each OD operator, including the mathematical formulations and justifications for their design choices.
*   **Elaborate on Operator Decomposition Strategy:** Discuss the criteria used for selecting and defining the basic operators, and explore alternative decomposition strategies.
*   **Incorporate Discussion of "Multimodal Evaluation"**: Add discussion of **multimodal evaluation** practices in the related work section. Even if there are no federated learning implementations, cite a couple of papers that demonstrate state-of-the-art in this area, like:
    *   "Multimodal Machine Learning: A Survey and Taxonomy" (Baltrušaitis et al., 2018)
    *   "MMBench: Is Your Multimodal Model an All-Rounder?" (Liu et al., 2023)
    Explicitly mentioning the term "**multimodal evaluation**" would make the paper more widely searchable.
*   **Provide Theoretical Analysis:** Include some theoretical analysis on the convergence and performance of the neural approximations, even for specific operators.
*   **Address Data Heterogeneity:** Briefly discuss the challenges and potential solutions for handling heterogeneous data (vertical FL).
*   **Automated Network Conversion Discussion:** Elaborate on the idea of automated network conversion using meta-learning, providing more details on the potential approaches and challenges.

**Overall Recommendation:**

This is a strong paper with a novel and potentially impactful contribution to the field of federated outlier detection. The paper is technically sound, well-evaluated, and generally well-written. Addressing the weaknesses and incorporating the suggestions for improvement would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact. I recommend this paper for acceptance, with the condition that the authors address the aforementioned concerns.
