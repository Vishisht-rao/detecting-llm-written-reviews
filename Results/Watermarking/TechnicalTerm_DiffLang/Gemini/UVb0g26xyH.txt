## Review of "VOCABULARY FOR UNIVERSAL APPROXIMATION : A LINGUISTIC PERSPECTIVE OF MAPPING COMPOSITIONS"

This paper presents an interesting theoretical result: it demonstrates the existence of a finite vocabulary of mappings that can be composed to approximate any continuous mapping on a compact domain. The authors draw an analogy to the compositionality of language, where a finite vocabulary and grammar can generate an infinite range of meanings. The core idea is to leverage flow maps of dynamical systems as the "words" in this vocabulary, and to constructively prove the universal approximation property.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The approach of using a finite vocabulary of mappings for universal approximation is novel and provides a fresh perspective on the expressiveness of deep networks. The linguistic analogy is intriguing and helps to frame the problem. The authors demonstrate a proof of concept for creating universal approximators.
*   **Technical Depth:** The paper is technically sound and relies on well-established mathematical tools like Lie product formulas, splitting methods, and Kronecker's theorem. The constructive proof provides insight into how such a vocabulary can be built.
*   **Clarity (mostly):** The paper is well-structured and the main results are clearly stated. The introduction provides a good motivation for the work, connecting it to recent trends in deep learning and language modeling. The sketch of the proof in Section 2.4 is helpful for understanding the overall strategy.
*   **Connections to Related Work:** The paper adequately discusses related work in universal approximation, residual networks, neural ODEs, control theory, compositionality, and word embeddings.
*   **Constructive Proof:** The proof is not just an existence proof; it provides a concrete (though perhaps impractical) construction of the vocabulary. This adds to the value and understanding of the result.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Practical Implications:** The paper is purely theoretical. The size of the required vocabulary (O(d^2)) and the potentially long sequences of compositions necessary for approximation raise serious concerns about the practical applicability of the results. The conclusion acknowledges this, but a more thorough discussion of the limitations would be beneficial. The reviewer agrees with the final sentence in the paper that an efficient vocabulary would be a fascinating future direction.
*   **Geometry-Aware Attention**: While the paper delves into the analogy between mapping compositions and language compositionality, it overlooks a significant area where similar principles have been explored in deep learning: **geometry-aware attention**.  Attention mechanisms, particularly in vision transformers, have been augmented to incorporate geometric relationships between input elements (e.g., image patches or point clouds).  These *geometry-aware attention* mechanisms effectively allow the model to focus on relevant elements based on their spatial arrangement, similar to how the mapping compositions manipulate the input space.  **The absence of any citation or discussion regarding *geometry-aware attention* is a notable oversight**. **The reviewer would suggest that the authors include the expression and a more detailed analysis of how their mapping composition approach relates to this type of attention mechanism**.
*   **Flow Maps:** The paper employs flow maps of dynamical systems for universal approximation. However, how to learn flow maps in a data-driven way is not made explicit or explored.
*   **Abstract/Introduction Mismatch:** The abstract hints at the weights being undetermined and requiring an infinite number of words, then pivots to the finite case. This contrast is somewhat jarring and could be better clarified.
*   **Notations (Minor):** While the notations are generally well-defined, the • operator could be introduced more naturally with an example.
*   **Related Works (Missing some links):** The related works section is comprehensive, but some connections between the different areas could be strengthened. For example, linking the word embedding discussion back to the compositionality discussion.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address Geometry-Aware Attention:** The authors *must* address the omission of *geometry-aware attention* in their discussion of related work.  This is a relevant area and could strengthen the paper by providing a point of comparison and potential integration.
*   **Discuss Practical Limitations in more detail:** Expand the discussion of the practical limitations of the results.  Consider providing estimates of the required sequence length for simple functions. This section could describe how the vocabulary would scale with higher dimensions or more complex functions.
*   **Clarify Relationship Between Vocabulary/Depth/Width:** Explicitly state what the trade-offs are between the size of the finite vocabulary and the "depth" of the composition. Is there a minimum vocabulary size given a fixed depth?
*   **Example application**: Provide an example of how this algorithm could be applied to an actual machine learning application.
*   **Explore Learning Flow Maps**: Briefly discuss potential methods for learning these flow maps from data. Can these flow maps be represented by a neural network?
*   **Strengthen Linguistic Analogy:** Provide more concrete examples of how the mapping compositions relate to specific linguistic structures.
*   **Typographical Errors:** Proofread carefully for typographical errors.

**Overall Recommendation:**

This is a well-written and theoretically interesting paper. The constructive proof of universal approximation using a finite vocabulary of mappings is a significant contribution. However, the lack of discussion about the practical implications and the absence of geometry-aware attention mechanisms are important weaknesses that should be addressed. The paper is recommended for acceptance *conditional* on addressing the points above, particularly the inclusion of a discussion and relevant citations regarding geometry-aware attention.
