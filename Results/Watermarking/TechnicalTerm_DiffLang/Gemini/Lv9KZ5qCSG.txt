**Review: Eye Fairness: A Large-Scale 3D Imaging Dataset for Equitable Eye Diseases Screening and Fair Identity Scaling**

**Summary:**

This paper introduces Eye Fairness, a novel, large-scale medical imaging dataset designed to address fairness concerns in automated eye disease screening. The dataset comprises 30,000 subjects with both 2D fundus photographs and 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans, coupled with six demographic identity attributes (age, gender, race, ethnicity, preferred language, and marital status). The dataset targets three major eye diseases: age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), and glaucoma.  Beyond the dataset, the paper proposes a Fair Identity Scaling (FIS) approach, a novel loss weighting scheme, and a performance-scaled disparity (PSD) metric for evaluating fairness. Experiments demonstrate the utility of Eye Fairness and the effectiveness of FIS compared to state-of-the-art fairness methods.

**Strengths:**

*   **Significant Contribution: Addressing a Critical Gap:**  The paper directly tackles a recognized problem: the lack of large-scale, high-quality, and demographically diverse medical imaging datasets for fairness research. Existing datasets are often repurposed, limited in demographic attributes, or small, particularly regarding 3D imaging. Eye Fairness represents a valuable resource for the community. This dataset has the potential to facilitate a new wave of research into fairness in medical image analysis, particularly for eye disease screening.
*   **Comprehensive Demographic Information:** The inclusion of six demographic attributes is a key strength. This moves beyond the typical age/gender/race combination and allows for more nuanced fairness evaluations and intersectional analysis.
*   **3D Imaging Data:** Providing both 2D and 3D imaging data (OCT) is a significant advantage. This opens avenues for exploring fairness in the context of richer, more clinically relevant data. The paper correctly points out that 3D fairness learning is largely unexplored due to the scarcity of such datasets.
*   **Novel Fairness Methodology:** The proposed FIS approach seems promising. The combination of group and individual scaling is a well-reasoned approach to address both inter-group disparities and intra-group variations. The motivation for combining group and individual scaling is well-articulated and addresses a potential limitation of group-only fairness methods.
*   **Intuitive Fairness Metric:** The introduction of Performance-Scaled Disparity (PSD) metrics is a valuable addition. It addresses a limitation of traditional fairness metrics by explicitly linking fairness to overall model performance, making it more interpretable for clinicians.
*   **Strong Experimental Results:** The experimental results generally support the claims. FIS consistently improves overall and group-specific AUC scores compared to baseline and other SOTA fairness methods, particularly regarding race and ethnicity.
*   **Public Availability:** The dataset and code being publicly accessible (via GitHub) is crucial for reproducibility and further research.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Novelty in Methodology Presentation:** While the FIS approach is interesting, the paper could benefit from a more formal mathematical derivation or theoretical justification for why this specific combination of group and individual scaling should lead to improved fairness. The rationale is clearly *stated*, but a more rigorous *proven* argument would strengthen the paper.
*   **Inconsistent Results and Overclaiming:** The results, while mostly positive, show some inconsistencies. For example, the claim of FIS "constantly" improving AUC in Blacks needs careful qualification as Table 7 shows a slight decrease in Blacks AUC for Glaucoma. Additionally, the PSD score degrades for Glaucoma when using OCT data. The authors should acknowledge these inconsistencies and provide potential explanations. A more nuanced discussion of the limitations of FIS would improve the paper's credibility. Claims should be tempered by acknowledging these limitations.
*   **Related Work Could be Expanded:** While the related work section covers medical fairness datasets and fairness models, it could be enriched by including research that studies **causal language models** and their mitigation for bias in medical contexts, as this area is gaining relevance in understanding and addressing biases embedded in data. More specifically, studies that apply **causal language models** to extract information from electronic health records (EHRs) and address biases in those extractions would enrich the related work.
*   **Implementation Details:** While the experimental setup section is detailed, more specific implementation details regarding the EfficientNet-B1 and VGG-derived 3D model architectures and training procedure would be beneficial for reproducibility. Especially, how the dataset was pre-processed is missing.
*   **Discussion on Data Acquisition:** The paper mentions the data is de-identified and approved by the IRB. It would be beneficial to provide a high-level overview of the data acquisition process. How was the data collected? Were there any potential biases introduced during the data collection or labeling process?
*   **Ablation Study Limitations:** The ablation study on fusion weight `c` is valuable, but it only focuses on overall AUC and Mean PSD. A more comprehensive ablation study could explore the impact of `c` on group-specific AUCs and different fairness metrics to provide a deeper understanding of its influence.

**Specific Comments and Suggestions:**

*   **Abstract:** The abstract could explicitly mention the novel PSD metric.
*   **Introduction:** The introduction could benefit from a more concise and impactful statement of the problem and the proposed solution.
*   **Related Work:**  Expand the related work section to include discussions on the application of **causal language models** for fairness and bias detection in medical data and their potential to address concerns related to the ethical implications of using sensitive patient data.
*   **Methodology:** Provide a more detailed mathematical formulation of the FIS approach and a theoretical justification for its effectiveness.
*   **Results:**  Acknowledge the inconsistencies in the results and provide potential explanations for them. Provide error bars on all metrics to clearly show statistical significance. Consider a more robust statistical analysis.
*   **Discussion:** A dedicated discussion section would be valuable to synthesize the findings, discuss limitations, and suggest directions for future research.
*   **Appendix:**  Provide more details on the computational cost and effects of various backbone models in the Appendix.

**Overall Assessment:**

This is a strong paper that makes a valuable contribution to the field of fairness in medical image analysis. The Eye Fairness dataset is a significant resource, and the proposed FIS approach and PSD metric show promise. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact. This paper is suitable for publication at ICLR 2024, contingent on addressing the reviewer's comments.
