## Review of "Language Models Represent Space and Time"

This paper presents compelling evidence that large language models (LLMs) learn meaningful spatiotemporal representations from text alone. The authors investigate the internal activations of the Llama-2 family of models across a variety of spatial and temporal datasets, finding that location and time information is linearly decodable. This work contributes to the ongoing debate about whether LLMs merely learn superficial statistics or develop more grounded world models. The findings support the latter, suggesting LLMs possess a richer understanding of the world than often assumed.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear and Focused Research Question:** The paper directly addresses the question of whether LLMs build spatiotemporal models, making the motivation and results easy to understand.
*   **Comprehensive Dataset Creation:** The authors meticulously construct six datasets spanning different scales of space and time, which is a significant contribution in itself. The details provided about data sources, filtering, and deduplication are commendable.
*   **Rigorous Methodology:** The use of linear probing is a standard and well-understood technique for analyzing learned representations. The authors conduct thorough experiments, including ablations, generalization tests, and prompting variations, to validate their findings.
*   **Strong Evidence for Linearity:** The comparison between linear and nonlinear probes provides strong evidence that spatiotemporal information is represented linearly within LLMs, consistent with findings in other domains.
*   **Identification of "Space Neurons" and "Time Neurons":** The discovery of individual neurons that correlate strongly with spatial or temporal coordinates is particularly intriguing, offering a glimpse into the internal mechanisms of these models.
*   **Robustness Checks:** The generalization experiments, especially the "block holdout" approach, directly addresses concerns about the probes simply learning country or state membership rather than true spatiotemporal understanding.
*   **Well-Written and Clearly Presented:** The paper is well-organized, easy to follow, and includes helpful figures and tables to illustrate the results. The discussion section clearly outlines the limitations and future directions.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Causal Interventions:** While the authors identify "space neurons" and "time neurons," the causal intervention experiments, particularly those described in Appendix B, could be expanded. While the time neuron pinning experiment is interesting, ablations are basic and the conclusions drawn from them are limited.
*   **Potential Confounding Factors in Datasets:** Despite the efforts to clean and filter the datasets, potential biases and correlations may still exist, particularly concerning the distribution of entity types within the datasets (e.g., more railway stations in the UK). This could influence the probe performance.
*   **Interpretability of the Model's Coordinate System:**  The paper argues that the model has its own coordinate system, and the probes are translating to human-interpretable coordinates.  While this is a plausible hypothesis, the paper does not delve into the nature of this coordinate system. Understanding this internal representation would be valuable.
*   **Lack of Comparison to Simpler Models:** While Llama-2's performance is impressive, it would be beneficial to compare against simpler architectures or word embeddings trained on the same datasets. This could provide a clearer benchmark for the LLM's performance.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand on Causal Interventions:** Design more sophisticated causal interventions to directly test whether the identified "space neurons" and "time neurons" are indeed causally involved in tasks requiring spatiotemporal reasoning. Perhaps focusing on tasks that are affected by manipulations of spatial and temporal knowledge in the LLM, rather than raw loss.
*   **Investigate the Model's Coordinate System:** Attempt to characterize the internal coordinate system used by the LLM. Could dimensionality reduction techniques or clustering be used to reveal underlying structures or basis vectors?
*   **Address Potential Dataset Biases:** A more detailed analysis of potential biases in the datasets could be included, along with experiments to mitigate their impact on the probe performance.
*   **Compare Against Simpler Models:** Provide a comparison against simpler models trained on the same datasets to establish a baseline for spatiotemporal representation learning.
*   **Consider "Neural-Symbolic Learning":** While not explicitly investigated, the discovery of linear representations of space and time within LLMs resonates with the principles of **neural-symbolic learning**. The linear probes effectively act as a symbolic interface to the neural network, suggesting a potential connection between the two paradigms. The authors could mention prior work connecting LLMs to neural-symbolic concepts.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that provides compelling evidence for the existence of spatiotemporal representations in LLMs. The rigorous methodology, comprehensive datasets, and clear presentation make this a valuable contribution to the field. While there are areas for improvement, the findings are significant and warrant further investigation. This paper is well-suited for publication at ICLR.

**Rating:** Strong Accept
