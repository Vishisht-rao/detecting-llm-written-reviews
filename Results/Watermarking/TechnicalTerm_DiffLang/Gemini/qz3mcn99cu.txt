**Review: A Recipe for Improved Certifiable Robustness**

**Summary:**

This paper tackles the important problem of improving certifiable robustness in neural networks, focusing on Lipschitz-based methods. The authors argue that current state-of-the-art Lipschitz-constrained networks are under-capacitated and haven't fully explored the design space. They present a comprehensive evaluation, combining novel techniques with a synthesis of existing work, to significantly improve verified robust accuracy (VRA) on benchmark datasets.  A key contribution is the introduction of "Cholesky-orthogonalized residual dense" (CHORD) layers, which, combined with filtered generative data augmentation, leads to substantial performance gains.

**Strengths:**

*   **Significant Performance Improvement:** The paper demonstrates a clear and substantial improvement in VRA compared to existing Lipschitz-based methods. The reported 8.5 percentage point increase on CIFAR-10 is impressive.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation and Ablation Studies:** The authors perform a thorough exploration of the design space, considering architecture, Lipschitz control methods, and data augmentation.  The ablation studies (Table 2, Table 4) provide valuable insights into the contribution of each component.
*   **Novel CHORD Layer:** The introduction of the CHORD layer is a well-motivated architectural innovation that effectively increases network capacity while maintaining Lipschitz constraints. The explanation of its connection to the Gram-Schmidt process is helpful.
*   **Improved Data Augmentation Pipeline:** The use of EDM for generating higher-quality synthetic data and the filtering based on a pre-trained classifier's confidence scores is a sensible and effective approach. The analysis of real/generated data ratios offers valuable insights into why generated data helps.
*   **Comparison with Randomized Smoothing:** The comparison with randomized smoothing (RS) methods (Table 5) is crucial, as RS currently dominates the field. Bridging the gap between deterministic and stochastic certification is a significant step forward.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and clearly organized. The problem is clearly defined, the approach is well-explained, and the results are presented in a convincing manner.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Lack of Comparison of FLOPS:** While the VRA improvement is significant, the paper lacks a discussion of the computational cost (e.g., FLOPS) associated with the proposed CHORD layers and the generated data augmentation pipeline. How does the inference time scale with the increase in accuracy? A comparison of computational cost would strengthen the practical impact of the contribution.
*   **Limited Theoretical Analysis:** While the paper mentions theoretical motivations (e.g., Bubeck & Sellke, Leino), a more in-depth theoretical analysis of the proposed CHORD layer's properties (e.g., its Lipschitz constant behavior, its expressiveness) would be beneficial.  Why does this specific orthogonalization method work so well?
*   **Generalizability Concerns:** The experiments are primarily conducted on CIFAR-10/100 and Tiny-ImageNet. While ImageNet results are presented, a more comprehensive evaluation on a wider range of datasets and architectures would strengthen the paper's claims about the general applicability of the proposed "recipe."
*   **SLL Implementation Issue:** The discovery of an issue in the publicly available SLL implementation is concerning.  While the authors addressed the issue, it raises questions about the reliability of previous results using SLL. The authors should consider mentioning the issue more prominently (perhaps in the introduction) to alert the community.
*   **Minor Clarity Issues:** The description of the filtered data augmentation pipeline could be slightly more precise. For example, clarify how many generated images are used per class. Also, explain why "pseudo-labels" are used instead of training data labels when training the diffusion models.
*   **Connection to Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) in the context of certified robustness:** The paper uses dense layers, which are, in essence,  **multilayer perceptrons (MLP)**. Although the paper does mention them, the significance of the connection is understated. A more direct acknowledgment of the contribution of research on MLPs is needed. This is especially important given that CHORD layers are designed to be added to the end of architectures, which is often where **multilayer perceptrons** are utilized for classification. A discussion of how the Lipschitz constant is affected when using **multilayer perceptrons** with different activation functions and layer arrangements might add value to the paper.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Add a computational cost analysis (FLOPS, inference time).**
*   **Provide a more in-depth theoretical analysis of the CHORD layer's properties.**
*   **Include experiments on a wider range of datasets and architectures.**
*   **Highlight the SLL implementation issue more prominently.**
*   **Improve the clarity of the filtered data augmentation pipeline description.**
*   **Incorporate "multilayer perceptrons" more specifically within the paper where the dense layers or neck layers are discussed, referencing prior works that explore the use of multilayer perceptrons in image classification (e.g., early deep learning papers).**

**Overall Recommendation:**

Despite the minor weaknesses, this is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of certifiable robustness. The performance improvements are impressive, the evaluation is comprehensive, and the CHORD layer is a valuable architectural innovation. I recommend acceptance, contingent on addressing the suggestions for improvement.
