## Review of "Sample-Efficient Quality-Diversity by Cooperative Coevolution"

This paper proposes a novel Cooperative Coevolution Quality-Diversity (CCQD) framework to improve the sample efficiency of Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms, particularly in the context of reinforcement learning (QD-RL). The core idea is to decompose a policy network into representation and decision parts, coevolving these parts separately to simplify the optimization problem. The authors argue that this approach allows for knowledge sharing within the representation part while maintaining diversity in the decision part, leading to improved sample efficiency. Experimental results on the QDax suite and Atari Pong demonstrate that CCQD outperforms existing QD algorithms, including MAP-Elites and several state-of-the-art methods, across various QD metrics.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The application of Cooperative Coevolution (CC) to the QD problem is a novel and interesting approach. The authors effectively leverage the divide-and-conquer strategy of CC to address the high dimensionality challenge in QD-RL.
*   **Decomposition Strategy:** The layer-based decomposition strategy, motivated by the different functional roles of layers in neural networks (representation vs. decision), is well-justified and seems to work effectively in practice.
*   **Performance:** The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the superior performance of CCQD over several competitive baselines. The reported 200% improvement in sample efficiency is significant and highlights the potential of the proposed framework.
*   **Generality:** The paper emphasizes that CCQD is a general framework that can be implemented with different parent selection, variation, and survivor selection operators. The authors provide a concrete instantiation using uniform parent selection, IsoLineDD, policy gradient variation, and vanilla archive-based survivor selection.
*   **Versatility:** The successful application of CCQD to both the QDax suite and the Atari Pong environment, showcasing its robustness and adaptability across different tasks and network architectures.
*   **Ablation Studies:** The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the contributions of different components of CCQD, such as the decomposition strategy and the inclusion of PeVFA critics.
*   **Archive Visualization:** The visualization of the archive and the association between representation parts and behavior descriptors helps to understand the inner workings of CCQD and supports the authors' claim that different representation parts capture different state representations.
*   **Well-written and Clear:** The paper is well-written, clear, and easy to follow. The authors provide sufficient background information and a detailed explanation of the proposed method.
*   **Code Availability:** The availability of the code is a significant positive, allowing for reproducibility and further research.
*   **Genome modeling considerations**. This consideration adds additional clarity that previous works do not mention.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Theoretical Analysis:** The paper lacks a theoretical analysis of the properties of CCQD. While the empirical results are strong, a theoretical understanding of why CCQD works well would further strengthen the paper. For example, bounds on the convergence rate or a comparison to existing theoretical results for QD algorithms would be valuable. The authors acknowledge this limitation in the conclusion.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** Although a hyperparameter sensitivity analysis is mentioned, it is relegated to the appendix.  More discussion in the main text about the sensitivity of CCQD to the representation population size (Nr) and other key hyperparameters would be beneficial.  How does the performance of CCQD degrade as the number of parameters increases (scaling)
*   **Scalability:** While Atari Pong is a higher-dimensional problem than the QDax environments, a more thorough investigation of the scalability of CCQD to even larger and more complex environments would be valuable. How does the performance of CCQD scale with the dimensionality of the state and action spaces?
*   **Survivor Selection for Representation Archive:** The survivor selection strategy for the representation archive seems relatively simple. Exploring more sophisticated methods for updating the representation archive could potentially improve performance.

**Minor Comments:**

*   The acronym "ERL-Re2" could be spelled out the first time it is mentioned for clarity.
*   In Algorithm 3, the "Variation" steps for decision and representation parts are assigned to {π′i}Ni=1 which is wrong since representation parts need to be assigned to {πR
    i}Nr
    i=1, it would be better to have different variables assigned for each step.
*   The "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS" should be positioned at the end of the paper not the beginning.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of Quality-Diversity optimization. The proposed CCQD framework is a novel and effective approach to improving the sample efficiency of QD algorithms. The experimental results are compelling and demonstrate the potential of CCQD for real-world applications. While the paper could benefit from a theoretical analysis and a more in-depth discussion of hyperparameter sensitivity and scalability, it is a strong contribution and I recommend acceptance.

**Recommendation:**

Accept.

**Questions for the Authors:**

*   Have you considered exploring more sophisticated survivor selection strategies for the representation archive?
*   Can you provide any theoretical insights into why CCQD works well?  For example, can you relate the decomposition strategy to the separability of the optimization problem?
*   How does the performance of CCQD scale with the dimensionality of the state and action spaces?
*   Regarding genome modelling, this field could further enhance the research since the paper does have considerations that many papers do not provide.
