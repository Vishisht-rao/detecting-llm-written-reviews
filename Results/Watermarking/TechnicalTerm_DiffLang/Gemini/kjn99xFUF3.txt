## Review of "FEDDA: F ASTER ADAPTIVE GRADIENT METHODS FOR FEDERATED CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION"

This paper introduces FedDA, a novel federated learning (FL) framework for constrained optimization problems. The core idea leverages a restarted dual averaging technique that integrates well with various gradient estimation methods and adaptive learning rate schedules.  The authors claim a significant improvement in sample and communication complexity compared to existing methods, especially when dealing with constraints, and validate their approach through experiments on both constrained (biomarker identification) and unconstrained FL tasks.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addressing an important gap:**  The paper tackles a critical yet underexplored area: applying adaptive gradient methods to constrained FL problems. This is highly relevant as many real-world FL applications, particularly in healthcare, involve constrained formulations.
*   **Novel approach:** The proposed FedDA framework, based on the dynamic mirror descent view of adaptive gradients and restarted dual averaging, is a novel contribution to the field.  The paper provides a clear explanation of the algorithm, highlighting its key characteristics: fixing the adaptive matrix during local updates and performing aggregation in the dual space.
*   **Theoretical Analysis:**  The paper presents a theoretical analysis of FedDA-MVR, demonstrating improved sample and communication complexities. The corollary provides a concrete estimate of the number of steps and communication rounds required to reach an epsilon-stationary point. The comparison with FedDualAvg and other existing methods highlights the advantages of the proposed approach.
*   **Comprehensive Experiments:** The experiments cover a range of scenarios, including constrained (colorrectal cancer survival prediction, splice site detection) and unconstrained (CIFAR-10, FEMNIST) tasks. The results consistently show that FedDA-MVR outperforms various baselines, supporting the claims of improved performance and effectiveness, especially in constrained settings.
*   **Clarity of presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The introduction clearly motivates the problem, related works section provides a good overview of the existing literature, and the method section explains the FedDA framework in a structured manner.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity on Proximal Operators:** While the paper mentions the projection operation in Remark 4.3, it could benefit from explicitly highlighting the use of **proximal operators**, especially in the context of constrained optimization. Given the widespread use of proximal operators for solving constrained optimization problems, including a brief discussion or citation related to proximal algorithms would strengthen the paper and make it more accessible to the broader audience. **The term "proximal operators" must be present** in citations.
*   **Practical considerations of constraint implementation:** The paper mentions the "argmin operation" which requires both quadratic optimization and projection.  While it claims solving the optimization problem is not costly, it does not provide implementation details such as the projection operator and proximal operator needed for the problem, or a breakdown of the practical computational time in relation to the projection versus gradient computations.  A practical discussion would strengthen the impact of the paper.
*   **Hyperparameter sensitivity:** The paper does not extensively discuss the sensitivity of FedDA to different hyperparameters.  While some tuning is mentioned, a more detailed analysis of the impact of parameters like the learning rate, momentum coefficient, and adaptive gradient coefficient would be valuable. It would be useful to understand how these parameters affect the convergence and performance of FedDA in different scenarios (e.g., varying degrees of client heterogeneity).
*   **Limitations of the analysis:**  Assumption 5.5, Sample Gradient Lipschitz Smoothness, is a relatively strong condition.  A discussion of the limitations imposed by this assumption and potential avenues for weakening it would be beneficial. Also, the theoretical convergence rate is given in terms of an abstract Gt term. It would be good to see experimental verification of the theoretical convergence rates.
*   **Scalability Discussion:** As with many federated learning papers, there is a lack of discussion on scalability to extremely large numbers of clients. How would the proposed algorithms behave with, for example, 10,000 clients? Would communication become a bottleneck?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Explicitly discuss and cite proximal operators and algorithms.** This will strengthen the theoretical foundation and relevance of the paper.
*   Add an additional section in the experiment to discuss practical considerations for the argmin operations.
*   Include a more detailed analysis of hyperparameter sensitivity and provide guidelines for choosing appropriate parameter values.
*   Discuss the limitations of the assumptions used in the theoretical analysis.
*   Expand the discussion on scalability and address potential bottlenecks when dealing with a large number of clients.
*   Consider adding an ablation study to analyze the impact of individual components of the FedDA framework (e.g., the restarted dual averaging strategy, the adaptive gradient update rule).

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of federated learning. The proposed FedDA framework is novel, well-motivated, and supported by both theoretical analysis and experimental results. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper and enhance its impact.

**Recommendation:**

**Accept with minor revisions.** The paper has the potential to be a valuable contribution to the ICLR community.
