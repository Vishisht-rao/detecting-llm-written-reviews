## Review of "PRETRAINED DEEP MODELS OUTPERFORM GBDT S IN LEARNING -TO-RANK UNDER LABEL SCARCITY"

This paper addresses an important and practical problem in Learning-to-Rank (LTR): how to leverage unlabeled data to improve performance of deep learning models in scenarios where labeled data is scarce, and where GBDTs traditionally outperform deep learning. The paper proposes using unsupervised pretraining for deep models, a technique widely successful in NLP and computer vision, but relatively unexplored in tabular LTR.  The authors introduce SimCLR-Rank, an LTR-specific pretraining loss, and demonstrate that pretrained deep models can consistently outperform GBDTs and non-pretrained models under label scarcity, not only on average but also on outlier queries. The experiments are conducted on both public benchmark datasets and a large industry-scale proprietary dataset, lending credibility to the findings. Overall, the paper is well-written, the problem is clearly defined, and the experimental results are compelling.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses an Important Problem:**  The paper tackles a crucial challenge in LTR – bridging the performance gap between deep learning and GBDTs, especially when labeled data is limited. This is a common scenario in real-world applications.
*   **Novel Application of Pretraining to LTR:** The paper explores a relatively unexplored area, applying unsupervised pretraining to tabular LTR, inspired by the successes in text and image domains.
*   **LTR-Specific Pretraining Loss (SimCLR-Rank):** The proposed SimCLR-Rank loss function is a valuable contribution, adapting the SimCLR concept to the specific characteristics of the LTR problem (i.e., the existence of hard negatives within query groups). The experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper presents a thorough evaluation on both public and proprietary datasets, considering different label scarcity scenarios (relevance scores vs. binary labels). The inclusion of an industry dataset adds significant practical value.
*   **Outlier Performance Evaluation:** The introduction of Outlier-NDCG is a welcome addition, highlighting the importance of performance on rare or difficult queries, which are often critical in real-world applications.
*   **Justification for Design Choices:**  The paper includes ablation studies and analyses to justify key design decisions, such as full finetuning vs. linear probing, and the choice of data augmentation. These analyses strengthen the credibility of the findings.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors provide a link to an anonymized repository with code and commands to regenerate results on public datasets, enhancing the reproducibility of the work.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity on Outlier Definition:** While Outlier-NDCG is a valuable metric, the specific method for defining outliers could be further clarified.  The description in Section 2.1 and Appendix A.2.1 is slightly dense and could benefit from a more intuitive explanation. A visual example of the histogram binning process and how it leads to outlier identification would be helpful.
*   **Lack of comparison with recent tabular SSL methods:** The related work section does a good job of covering a range of tabular SSL approaches, but the results section could benefit from including a baseline that represents the state-of-the-art in tabular pretraining. Even if computationally expensive, including a single data point comparing against the best known pretraining would strengthen the claims.
*   **Limited Analysis of SimSiam vs. SimCLR-Rank on the Online Shopping Dataset:** Table 3 shows a substantial difference in performance between SimSiam and SimCLR-Rank on the proprietary dataset. While Section 4.3.3 explores this difference using t-SNE plots on public datasets, a more in-depth analysis of *why* SimSiam performs so much better on the online shopping dataset would be valuable. Are there specific characteristics of this dataset that favor SimSiam's clustering strategy?
*   **Citation of "Non-decomposable objectives":** It looks like the paper does not cite work related to non-decomposable objectives in learning to rank. This is surprising since the literature on learning to rank is ripe with non-decomposable objective functions.
*   **Typos and Grammatical Errors:** There are some minor typos and grammatical errors throughout the paper (e.g., in the title, "GBDT S"). A careful proofread would improve the overall presentation.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Improve Clarity on Outlier Definition:**  Provide a more intuitive explanation of the outlier detection method, possibly including a visual example. Discuss the sensitivity of the results to the choice of `G` and the 1% outlier threshold.
*   **Include comparison with the best known pretraining for tables:** Even if computationally expensive, including a single data point comparing against the best known pretraining would strengthen the claims.
*   **Deepen Analysis of SimSiam vs. SimCLR-Rank on Industry Data:** Investigate and explain the significant performance difference between SimSiam and SimCLR-Rank on the proprietary online shopping dataset.
*   **Proofread for Typos and Grammatical Errors:**  Thoroughly proofread the paper to correct any typos and grammatical errors.
*   **Cite work related to non-decomposable objectives in learning to rank:** This is surprising since the literature on learning to rank is ripe with non-decomposable objective functions.

**Overall Recommendation:**

I recommend accepting this paper to ICLR 2024. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of LTR by demonstrating the effectiveness of unsupervised pretraining for deep models under label scarcity. The proposed SimCLR-Rank loss is a valuable addition, and the comprehensive experimental evaluation on both public and proprietary datasets lends strong credibility to the findings. Addressing the minor weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper.
