### Review of "Designing Skill-Compatible AI: Methodologies and Frameworks in Chess"

#### Summary

The paper presents a valuable exploration into the design and evaluation of skill-compatible AI agents in the context of chess. As AI has achieved superhuman performance, the authors highlight the critical issue of compatibility with weaker human partners or lower-skilled agents. The paper introduces formal evaluation frameworks and three distinct methodologies for creating skill-compatible chess AI, allowing powerful AI systems to effectively collaborate with less skilled agents. The methodologies are tested across two collaborative chess frameworks, demonstrating that these skill-compatible agents can outperform traditional state-of-the-art chess engines while still achieving effective interactions with weaker partners.

#### Strengths

1. **Innovative Concept**: The notion of skill compatibility in AI is a compelling addition to the discourse on artificial intelligence. It acknowledges an often-overlooked aspect of AI deployment in collaborative settings, suggesting that mere performance is insufficient for effective human-AI interactions.

2. **Robust Experimental Design**: The experiments conducted across diverse frameworks (Stochastic Tag Team and Hand and Brain) are thorough and methodically structured. The use of a wide array of chess engines, including both superhuman and human-like agents, provides a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed methodologies.

3. **Clear Contribution**: The work distinguishes itself by not only proposing effective methodologies (Tree agent, Expector agent, Attuned agent) but also by providing empirical evidence of their utility. This contribution is particularly relevant for future AI system design that involves collaboration across varying skill levels.

4. **Statistical Rigor**: The authors employ appropriate statistical tests to validate their claims, detailing the experimental setups and results in a way that enhances reproducibility.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Generality of Findings**: While the proposed methodologies are validated in a chess setting, the paper could strengthen its claims regarding the applicability of these approaches to other domains. Acknowledging limitations or deviations in other complex multi-agent systems would provide a broader context and understanding of the results.

2. **Detail on Practical Applications**: Although the paper provides a robust experimental foundation, it would benefit from a deeper discussion on how these methodologies could translate into real-world applications beyond chess. Potential applications in other decision-making scenarios or fields like robotics, healthcare, or education would enhance the relevance and impact of the research.

3. **Clarification of Mechanisms**: While the paper discusses mechanisms behind skill compatibility, further exploration of the causal links between methodologies and observed outcomes could provide more profound insights. For instance, detailing how agents learn to adapt their strategies based on subordinate interactions could bolster understanding of their development.

4. **Future Work Directions**: While the authors briefly mention directions for future research, a more comprehensive analysis of potential avenues, particularly involving human partners or other non-chess-related collaborative scenarios, would be beneficial. This could set a clear agenda for the broader implications of their research.

#### Conclusion

Overall, this paper makes a substantial contribution to the field of AI by introducing and empirically validating frameworks for designing skill-compatible agents in chess. It not only advances our understanding of AI interactions with varying skill levels but sets the groundwork for future research in human-AI collaboration. With some further elucidation on the generalizability of the findings and practical applications, this work will serve as a significant reference point for scholars and practitioners alike. I recommend accepting this paper for publication at ICLR 2024, with suggestions for addressing the noted weaknesses.
