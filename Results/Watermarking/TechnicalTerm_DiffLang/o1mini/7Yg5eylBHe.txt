**Review of "ZGS-Based Event-Driven Algorithms for Bayesian Optimization in Fully Distributed Multi-Agent Systems"**

**Summary:**
The paper proposes a novel framework for Distributed Bayesian Optimization (DBO) tailored for fully distributed multi-agent systems (MASs), contrasting with previous work that has primarily focused on centralized and federated learning scenarios. The authors present the Zero-Gradient-Sum-Based Event-Driven Distributed Lower Confidence Bound (ZGS-ED-DLCB) algorithm, which aims to optimize expensive black-box functions while ensuring efficient communication and safeguarding data privacy among agents. The methodology relies on random Fourier features as a surrogate model for Gaussian processes, addressing key challenges related to privacy and communication inefficiency in the context of distributed learning.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Framework**: The introduction of DBO and the specific challenges addressed are relevant and timely, particularly given the increasing interest in distributed systems and privacy-preserving techniques.
2. **Theoretical Contributions**: The formulation of a generalized fully distributed convergence theorem represents a significant advancement, providing a foundation for future research in this area.
3. **Robust Evaluation**: The paper is well-supported with both theoretical analyses and empirical experiments that validate the proposed algorithm against state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating significant performance improvements.
4. **Extensive Experiments**: The inclusion of both synthetic and real-world experiments provides a comprehensive view of the algorithm's capabilities and robustness in practical scenarios.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complex Presentation**: The paper is dense, and some sections may be challenging for readers to follow without a strong background in distributed optimization and Bayesian methods. Simplifying language or providing more intuitive explanations could enhance accessibility.
2. **Limited Discussion on Limitations**: While the authors assert the advantages of their approach, a more in-depth discussion of the algorithm's limitations and potential failure modes in extreme scenarios would be prudent.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Although performance metrics are presented, a deeper analysis of the trade-offs between the proposed method and existing alternatives could enrich the discussion. For instance, how does the computational cost of ZGS-ED-DLCB compare to similar algorithms under varying scales?

**Detailed Comments:**
1. **The Introduction**: The motivation for DBO is compelling. However, it could benefit from a clearer delineation of how this novel approach differs from existing federated learning strategies beyond merely being "fully distributed."
2. **Mathematical Rigor**: The mathematical definitions and proofs provided throughout the paper, while rigorous, may overwhelm readers unfamiliar with advanced optimization theory. It may be beneficial to elaborate on key steps in the proofs or summarize their implications more explicitly.
3. **Event-Driven Mechanism**: The event-driven mechanism is an innovative approach to enhancing communication efficiency. Further exploration of its efficiency gains compared to traditional communication models could amplify the significance of this contribution.
4. **Choice of Baselines**: The selection of baselines was appropriate, yet one might argue for additional comparisons with more recent algorithms specifically designed for distributed Bayesian optimization to fully contextualize the advancements.

**Conclusion:**
The paper delivers an important contribution to the field of distributed optimization through the introduction of a novel algorithm that tackles significant challenges related to privacy and communication in distributed systems. Addressing the outlined weaknesses could enhance the paper's clarity and impact. Overall, this work is likely to stimulate further research in the integration of Bayesian optimization with distributed learning frameworks.
