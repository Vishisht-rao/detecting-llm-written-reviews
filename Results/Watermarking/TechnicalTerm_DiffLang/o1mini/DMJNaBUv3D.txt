**Review of “Less is More: On the Feature Redundancy of Pretrained Models When Transferring to Few-Shot Tasks”**

The paper presents an intriguing investigation into the phenomenon of feature redundancy in pretrained models when applied to few-shot learning tasks. The authors provide a systematic analysis of how the dimensionality of features impacts classification performance under varying shot conditions, demonstrating that a notable fraction of the dimensions can be redundant or even harmful in a few-shot context. 

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The exploration of the feature redundancy phenomenon is a timely contribution, as it sheds light on the inherent challenges of few-shot learning, particularly in the context of pretrained models. The findings have far-reaching implications for the design and application of transfer learning approaches.

2. **Empirical Validation**: The use of extensive experiments across a variety of datasets and pretrained models strengthens the paper's claims. The authors convincingly illustrate that only a small fraction of feature dimensions can be effectively utilized without significant performance degradation, particularly in few-shot settings.

3. **Theoretical Insight**: The theoretical framework provided to support the empirical findings is commendable. The authors elaborate on the conditions under which feature dimensions are deemed redundant and offer insights into the variance and distance metrics that contribute to the classification boundaries in few-shot scenarios.

4. **Practical Solutions**: The proposed method of adjusting feature magnitudes based on estimated feature importance is practical and offers a constructive way forward. The results indicating that this approach improves few-shot transfer performance across various datasets and pretrained models are important for both research and application.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity of Estimating Feature Importance**: While the paper addresses the challenge of accurately identifying redundant features using a small number of samples, the proposed method may be subject to limitations in scenarios with significant noise or variations in data. Potential improvements or alternative strategies for feature importance estimation could be explored.

2. **Generalization Beyond Few-Shot**: The paper could benefit from discussing the implications of feature redundancy beyond few-shot scenarios. How might these insights affect standard transfer learning protocols when more data is available? 

3. **Lack of Broader Context**: Though the paper references related studies, a deeper integration of how this work fits into the broader landscape of transfer learning research would enhance the understanding of its significance. Comparisons with other existing methods or insights from recent advancements in few-shot learning would bolster the narrative.

4. **Acknowledgment of Limitations**: While the paper offers a promising approach to mitigating feature redundancy, a more thorough discussion of the limitations of the proposed methodology—especially relating to computational demands and applicability in real-world settings—would provide balanced and constructive insights.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution by addressing an important aspect of feature utilization in pretrained models for few-shot learning tasks. Its empirical and theoretical findings pave the way for further research on feature selection strategies and could influence future developments in transfer learning methodologies. With slight adjustments to expand the discussion on limitations and context, the paper would ideally suit the audience of the ICLR conference. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to enhance clarity and breadth. 

**Recommendation: Accept with Minor Revisions**
