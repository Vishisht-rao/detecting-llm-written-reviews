**Review of the Paper: "SHIFT ADDAUG: AUGMENT MULTIPLICATION-FREE TINY NEURAL NETWORK WITH HYBRID COMPUTATION"**

The submitted manuscript presents a novel training methodology named ShiftAddAug, designed to enhance the performance of multiplication-free tiny neural networks (NNs). The approach leverages hybrid computation, integrating costly multiplication operations during the training phase to augment the efficiency of multiplication-free operators while ensuring that only the efficient operators are used during inference. The authors claim significant improvements in accuracy and energy efficiency, making their work relevant in the context of deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained platforms such as IoT devices.

**Strengths:**

1. **Relevance**: The topic of efficient neural networks, particularly multiplication-free architectures, is timely and important due to the increasing need for deploying models on low-resource devices. The authors effectively highlight the advantages of their method in achieving higher accuracy and efficiency.

2. **Experimental Validation**: The paper provides extensive experimental results across multiple datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet, among others) and various architectures (MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3, MCUNet, ProxylessNAS). These experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ShiftAddAug, showing consistent accuracy improvements and energy savings compared to traditional multiplicative networks.

3. **Hybrid Computation Strategy**: The introduction of a hybrid computing strategy—utilizing both multiplication-free and multiplicative operations—represents an interesting and innovative approach that could inspire future work in this area. The authors provide a solid rationale for why this methodology could lead to better performance.

4. **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**: The integration of a hardware-aware NAS to further optimize multiplication-free tiny neural networks is an excellent idea. It addresses performance scalability and adaptability in real-world applications.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Clarity and Structure**: The overall clarity of the manuscript can be improved. Some sections, particularly in the method description, are dense and might confuse readers unfamiliar with the intricate details of neural network training. Better structuring and clearer definitions of key terms and concepts would enhance the readability of the work.

2. **Mathematical Presentation**: While the paper includes several mathematical equations, the presentation could benefit from simplification. Some equations are dense and could be streamlined to improve comprehension. For instance, Equation (1) and subsequent operator definitions might still confuse readers due to insufficient context on their use and implications.

3. **Lack of Comparison with State-of-the-Art Methods**: While the paper presents comparisons with several baseline models, including traditional multiplication-based architectures, there is insufficient discussion on how the proposed method performs compared to other state-of-the-art multiplication-free models. A deeper comparative analysis would strengthen the claims of superiority and novelty.  

4. **Ablation Studies**: The ablation studies, while present, could be more extensive. The paper references certain configurations without explaining their significance fully. Clear explanations of the experimental setups and results would strengthen the justification for using certain methodologies over others.

5. **Conclusion and Contribution Discussion**: The conclusion summarizes the contributions but could better contextualize the broader implications of the proposed work. A more explicit connection between ShiftAddAug's findings and potential future research directions would provide valuable insight into the impact and importance of the methodology in the field.

**Overall Assessment:**
The paper presents a promising approach to enhancing multiplication-free tiny neural networks through hybrid computation. While demonstrating substantial experimental results validating their approach, improvements in clarity, structure, and comparative analysis are needed. These adjustments could significantly strengthen the manuscript’s impact and accessibility to a broader audience. As it stands, the work is a valuable contribution to the field of efficient neural network design and deployability in resource-limited environments. 

**Recommendation**: Minor revisions with a focus on clarity and comparative evaluation are suggested before reconsideration for publication at ICLR 2024.
