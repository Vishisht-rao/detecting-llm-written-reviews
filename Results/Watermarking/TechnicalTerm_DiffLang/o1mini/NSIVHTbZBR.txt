**Review of “Image Inpainting via Tractable Steering of Diffusion Models”**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel approach named Tiramisu for the task of image inpainting utilizing Tractable Probabilistic Models (TPMs) to guide the denoising process of diffusion models. The authors highlight the challenges in controlling the image generation of diffusion models due to the intractability of conditioning on constraints. They propose leveraging the expressiveness of Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) to compute constrained posteriors efficiently, thereby improving the quality and coherence of inpainted images.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovation:** The introduction of TPMs, particularly Probabilistic Circuits, for constrained image generation is a significant contribution to the field. The paper addresses an important gap in existing diffusion-based generation systems that struggle with exact conditioning on constraints.
   
2. **Empirical Validation:** The experimental section is robust, testing the Tiramisu method across three high-resolution datasets (CelebA-HQ, ImageNet, LSUN) with multiple mask types. The results indicate a clear performance improvement over state-of-the-art inpainting methods, reinforcing the proposed approach's validity.
   
3. **Theoretical Framework:** The paper provides a theoretical basis for how PCs can be integrated into the denoising process of diffusion models, including clear definitions and algorithm descriptions that are crucial for reproducibility.

4. **Computational Efficiency:** The reported additional computational overhead of only ≈10% for achieving higher quality inpainting is appealing, particularly when compared to typical models that require significant resource expenditures.

5. **Potential Applications:** The expansion of this method to tasks beyond inpainting—such as semantic fusion—demonstrates the versatility and scalability of the approach, opening avenues for future research and application.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity and Accessibility:** The technical details related to TPMs and the architecture of PCs might present a steep learning curve for practitioners who are not well-versed in probabilistic models. This aspect could limit the accessibility of the methodology to a broader audience.

2. **Comparative Evaluation:** While the empirical results are impressive, additional comparisons with other generative models (e.g., GANs, VAEs) would offer richer insights into the relative performance strengths and weaknesses of Tiramisu. Additionally, the paper could benefit from qualitative analyses from user studies, further contextualizing how the improvements translate to human-perceived quality.

3. **Limitations of Soft Constraints:** The reliance on soft-evidence constraints for conditional generation may lead to potential biases in the output if not carefully managed. The paper could discuss potential avenues to mitigate this, ensuring reliability across various applications.

4. **Scalability Concerns for High-Resolution Images:** The paper claims that the proposed method can handle high-resolution image inpainting; however, the challenges of working directly in pixel space are acknowledged as a major barrier. While the use of VQ-GAN for a latent space representation is a positive workaround, a more thorough exploration of the trade-offs involved would improve robustness.

5. **Discussion on Practical Applications:** Although the theoretical and empirical contributions are clear, the paper could further elaborate on practical applications of Tiramisu in real-world scenarios, particularly in creative industries and within user interfaces.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper makes a compelling contribution to the image inpainting domain through its innovative approach leveraging TPMs to steer diffusion models. Its theoretical framework is solid, and the empirical results substantiate the claims made in the work. However, addressing the highlighted weaknesses regarding complexity, comparative evaluation, constraints, and practical applications would significantly enhance the impact and comprehensibility of the research. I recommend this paper for acceptance, with minor revisions to address the aforementioned weaknesses.
