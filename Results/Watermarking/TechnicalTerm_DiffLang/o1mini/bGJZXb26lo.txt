**Review of "DITTO: Offline Imitation Learning with World Models"**

**Summary**  
The paper presents DITTO, a novel algorithm for offline imitation learning that tackles three significant challenges in this domain: high-dimensional observations, covariate shift in training and test distributions, and the need for offline learning without interactions with the environment. DITTO leverages a learned world model to define a distance measure in a latent space, which serves as a basis for formulating an intrinsic reward. The authors theoretically derive bounds on the expected difference in performance between the expert and learner, suggesting a reduction of covariate shift when optimizing this distance measure. They demonstrate the efficacy of DITTO through experiments on challenging Atari environments, achieving state-of-the-art results and showcasing improvements over adapted versions of classic imitation learning algorithms such as behavioral cloning and generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL).

**Strengths**  
1. **Innovative Approach**: The use of world models for offline imitation learning is a fresh concept in the literature. By mapping expert behaviors through an intrinsic reward based on latent divergence, the authors provide a compelling solution to the covariate shift problem, which has been a longstanding issue in imitation learning.

2. **Theoretical Foundation**: The paper includes theoretical results that help to ground the proposed method in established imitation learning frameworks. The bounds connected to divergence minimization will likely be of interest to researchers working in this area.

3. **Empirical Validation**: The experimental results are comprehensive and indicate the superiority of DITTO over both standard imitation techniques and newly adapted algorithms with world models (D-BC, D-GAIL), demonstrating solid performance in various Atari games.

4. **Discussion of Covariate Shift**: The paper provides a nuanced look at covariate shift, articulating how DITTO maintains robust policy learning despite training from a static dataset, which contributes to the understanding of this fundamental issue in imitation learning.

5. **Clear Structure and Presentation**: The paper is well-organized, with a logical flow from introduction to methodologies to results, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments.

**Weaknesses**  
1. **Overreliance on World Models**: While world models are powerful tools for representation learning, their performance is heavily dependent on the quality and coverage of the training data. The authors could discuss how poor performances in the world model might affect the overall performance of DITTO in real-world applications, especially when dealing with noisy data.

2. **Action Prediction Accuracy**: The paper notes a counterintuitive finding that action prediction accuracy does not correlate with extrinsic performance. It would be beneficial for the authors to explore the implications of this finding and discuss how to effectively measure and interpret policy performance in practice.

3. **Algorithmic Complexity**: The algorithm's reliance on multiple learning phases (world model training followed by agent training) introduces complexity that might be challenging to implement and tune in practical settings. Discussing potential simplifications or guidelines for practical deployment could enhance the paper.

4. **Ablations and Adaptivity**: While the results are promising, the ablation studies regarding the choice of hyperparameters (such as the horizon length and the type of distance function) could be expanded. It would help to clarify how adaptive the method is to various domain specifics, which can significantly affect the learning process.

**Overall Impression**  
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of imitation learning, particularly in offline settings. The combination of world models with the novel intrinsic reward mechanism addresses crucial challenges, offering insights that are both theoretically sound and empirically validated. The findings are promising, suggesting that DITTO opens up avenues for future research and application in high-dimensional decision-making environments, such as robotics. However, acknowledging the limitations and potential complexities of implementing such methods in diverse contexts would strengthen the work.

**Recommendation**: Accept with minor revisions. Please address the weaknesses identified in the review, particularly regarding the practical implications of world models and the interpretability of action prediction metrics.
