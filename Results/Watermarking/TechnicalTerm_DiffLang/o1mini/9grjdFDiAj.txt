**Review of "Probabilistic Stability of Stochastic Gradient Descent"**

**Overall Assessment:**
The paper presents a novel perspective on the stability of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) through the concept of probabilistic stability. The authors argue that traditional variance-based definitions of stability are insufficient to capture the dynamics of SGD, especially in the high-dimensional landscapes associated with deep learning. Their approach leverages the Lyapunov exponent as a metric to understand the phases of learning and the behavior of SGD around saddle points, providing valuable insights into the interplay of gradient noise and learning rate.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Conceptual Framework:** The introduction of probabilistic stability as an alternative to variance-based definitions represents a significant contribution to the field. By situating SGD within the context of dynamical systems and stability theory, the authors provide a refreshing perspective and advance our understanding of the algorithm's behavior.

2. **Comprehensive Theoretical Justification:** The use of Lyapunov exponents to characterize stability is well-explained and theoretically sound. The connections drawn between Lyapunov stability, effective learning rates, and the phases of learning are particularly compelling and demonstrate the depth of analysis.

3. **Empirical Validation of Theoretical Results:** The paper includes multiple experiments and phase diagrams that complement the theoretical assertions. Figures clearly illustrate various phases of learning and validate the proposed framework's predictions regarding the convergence behavior of SGD under different conditions.

4. **Rich Discussion and Implications:** The authors engage with recent literature, situating their findings within the broader context of deep learning stability and convergence phenomena. The implications for bias in SGD towards low-rank solutions are particularly noteworthy.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity of Presentation:** Some parts of the paper, especially the theoretical sections, may be challenging for a broader audience to digest, particularly for those without a strong background in dynamical systems or stochastic processes. A more intuitive exposition or additional supporting material might help improve accessibility.

2. **Limited Focus on Practical Implications:** While theoretical contributions are emphasized, there could be a deeper exploration of practical implications for typical deep learning scenarios. Discussions about how practitioners can apply these findings to improve training convergence or model selection would enhance the paper's relevance.

3. **Assumption of Independence in Dynamics:** The dynamics are analyzed under certain assumptions about independence among different data points and batches. Real-world data often violate these assumptions, and the analysis might not adequately address the effects of correlated data, which are common in many practical applications.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Enhance Clarity of Key Concepts:** Consider providing more intuitive explanations or visual aids that help clarify the complex mathematical concepts for a broader audience. This will improve engagement with the findings.

2. **Broader Discussion on Applications:** Expand the discussion of practical applications and implications of the findings for deep learning practitioners. This would enhance the relevance and usability of the research.

3. **Address Potential Limitations:** Acknowledge and discuss the assumptions made in the theoretical framework, specifically regarding data independence and noise. Addressing these limitations will strengthen the paper's credibility.

**Conclusion:**
This paper offers a significant advancement in the understanding of SGD's stability by proposing a probabilistic framework based on Lyapunov exponents. While it presents challenges in accessibility and practical application, the theoretical depth and empirical support ultimately make a valuable contribution to the literature on optimization in deep learning. I recommend publication with minor revisions to enhance clarity and practical relevance.
