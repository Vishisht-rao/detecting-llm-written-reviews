**Review of "Illusory Attacks: Information-Theoretic Detectability Matters in Adversarial Attacks"**

**Summary:**
This paper introduces a novel class of adversarial attacks in the context of reinforcement learning, termed "ϵ-illusory attacks." The authors claim that traditional observation-space attacks, while effective, are generally detectable using automated methods or human inspection due to their lack of information-theoretic constraints on detectability. By contrast, ϵ-illusory attacks aim to minimize victim reward while adhering to a statistical detectability limit defined by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence thresholds. The authors present theoretical grounding, empirical evaluations across multiple environments, and insights into the implications for future cybersecurity practices and defense mechanisms.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Concept:** The introduction of the ϵ-illusory attack framework, which grounds adversarial attacks in information theory, presents a significant advancement in the understanding of adversarial dynamics within RL contexts. The focus on detectability constraints is timely and relevant, especially in light of increasing adversarial threats in AI systems.

2. **Comprehensive Methodology:** The dual ascent algorithm developed for training these attacks is well-articulated, and the authors provide thorough details about the learning process. The empirically validated findings across various benchmark problems effectively demonstrate the attack framework's performance relative to traditional methods.

3. **Human and Automated Detection Studies:** The inclusion of studies on human detectability is a valuable contribution, highlighting the practical implications of adversarial attacks beyond computational metrics. The distinction between the effectiveness of the ϵ-illusory attacks and conventional attacks in the eyes of human inspectors adds depth to the analysis.

4. **Future Directions:** The paper thoughtfully outlines pathways for future research, including improved anomaly detection mechanisms and deeper investigations into the human ability to identify adversarial manipulations.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Clarity and Depth of Theoretical Foundations:** While the theoretical foundation is promising, some sections may benefit from further clarification. For instance, the mathematical formalism surrounding KL divergence and the implications of the dual ascent algorithm might pose challenges to readers unfamiliar with these concepts. A more intuitive explanation could enhance accessibility.

2. **Empirical Validation Limitations:** Although the empirical results suggest the effectiveness of ϵ-illusory attacks, the reliance on simulation-based environments for evaluations may limit the generalizability of the findings to real-world scenarios. The authors acknowledge this limitation, yet it could be helpful to expand on how the findings may translate to practical implementations in various domains.

3. **Lack of Counter-attack Frameworks Discussion:** The paper primarily focuses on the attack strategy and its implications for victim agents. A discussion of potential countermeasures or training methods that could mitigate the effectiveness of illusory attacks in real-time systems would provide a more balanced perspective on the vulnerability landscape.

4. **IRB Approval Mention:** While the authors mention IRB approval for studies involving human participants, a more detailed explanation of the methodology used in the human detection study may enhance the credibility and reproducibility of these findings.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, "Illusory Attacks: Information-Theoretic Detectability Matters in Adversarial Attacks" provides an essential contribution to the understanding of adversarial attacks in reinforcement learning. Its innovative approach to combining theoretical rigor with empirical validation underscores the need for a proactive stance on AI security. However, improvements in clarity, expanded discussions on limitations, and practical implications could significantly enhance the paper's impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the identified weaknesses.
