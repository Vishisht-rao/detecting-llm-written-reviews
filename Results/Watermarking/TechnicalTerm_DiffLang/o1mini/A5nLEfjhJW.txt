**Review of "SHARCS: SHARed Concept Space for Explainable Multimodal Learning"**

**Summary:**
The authors present a novel approach for explainable multimodal learning called SHARCS (SHARed Concept Space). The proposed methodology aims to unify concepts from various data modalities into a shared concept space, thereby allowing the generation of semantically meaningful cross-modal explanations and improved predictive performance. The paper argues that existing multimodal learning models struggle with explainability and often do not adequately support domain expert intervention, particularly in safety-critical applications. The authors showcase SHARCS's ability to handle missing modalities effectively and provide intuitive concept-based explanations, demonstrating its advantages over both unimodal and other multimodal baseline approaches.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty and Contribution**: The paper contributes to the emerging field of explainable AI by presenting SHARCS, which integrates concepts from heterogeneous modalities into a shared space. This concept space allows for intuitive semantic projections and facilitates explainability in multimodal contexts.
2. **Empirical Validation**: The authors substantiate their claims with a well-structured set of experiments across four distinct multimodal datasets (tabular, text, image, and graph data). The results demonstrate that SHARCS outperforms or matches existing unimodal and multimodal baselines, particularly in scenarios involving missing modalities.
3. **Focus on Interpretability**: SHARCS's emphasis on providing interpretable predictions is a valuable contribution, particularly in fields where agent trustworthiness is critical. The ability to generate concept-based explanations enhances user understanding and offers potential for human-agent collaboration.
4. **Methodological Rigor**: The paper provides extensive details about the architecture, learning process, and experiments. The explicative diagrams, while sometimes technical, effectively illustrate the workings of SHARCS and the concept space.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Scalability Concerns**: While SHARCS performs well on the tested datasets, the authors should discuss potential limitations when scaling the approach to more complex, real-world datasets with higher dimensionality or more diverse modalities. Additional empirical evidence or theoretical justification would strengthen the claims about scalability.
2. **Assumptions in the Model**: The authors mention that SHARCS assumes the existence of relationships between the same samples in different modalities. This could be problematic in diverse real-world situations where such assumptions may not hold. A thorough discussion about the potential pitfalls when this assumption is violated would enhance the robustness of the approach.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Although the paper compares SHARCS with various existing methods, it would benefit from more extensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art multimodal learning techniques, particularly those developed after the recent advances in contrastive learning and self-supervised methods. This would provide a clearer position within the current research landscape.
4. **Potential for Further Generalization**: The paper could explore the potential for SHARCS to generalize to more than just two modalities, addressing the flexibility of the framework in diverse scenarios. Discussion on incorporating multimodal data with different sizes, distributions, or noise levels would be insightful.

**Minor Points:**
- Typographical errors (e.g., "maps interpretable concepts from different heteroge- neous modalities") could be reviewed for clarity and conciseness.
- The writing could be made more accessible by minimizing jargon where possible and explaining complex technical terms more thoroughly.

**Conclusion**: 
SHARCS represents a significant advance in the field of explainable multimodal learning. The approach is well-motivated, with solid empirical results supporting its effectiveness and interpretability. Addressing the outlined weaknesses will further solidify its contributions. Overall, this paper would be a valuable addition to the conference and merits publication with improvements in clarity and rigor. 

**Recommendation**: Accept with minor revisions.
