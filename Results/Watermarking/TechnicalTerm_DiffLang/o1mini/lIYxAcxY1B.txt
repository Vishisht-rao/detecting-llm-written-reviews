### Review of "Understanding Sparse Feature Updates in Deep Networks Using Iterative Linearisation"

#### Summary

The authors present a novel training method called "iterative linearisation" to investigate the dynamics of feature learning in deep networks, especially contrasting the behavior of finite networks with insights derived from the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory related to infinite networks. The paper argues that while conventional gradient descent leads to substantial feature learning, their method allows for controlled, sparse feature updates and quantifies their contributions to performance. The findings indicate that comparable generalization performance to standard training can be achieved with a limited number of feature updates. The paper also connects the implications of their findings to established second-order optimization techniques like the Gauss-Newton algorithm.

#### Strengths

1. **Novelty and Contribution**: The introduction of iterative linearisation as a method to modulate feature learning frequency is both innovative and significant, allowing researchers to bridge concepts of lazy and rich training regimes effectively.

2. **Theoretical Insights**: The authors link their approach to the Gauss-Newton method, providing a solid theoretical justification for the validity of their algorithm. This connection enhances the understanding of how sparse feature updates can influence generalization behavior.

3. **Empirical Validation**: The paper presents thorough empirical studies on standard architectures (including CNNs and ResNet18 on CIFAR10) that convincingly substantiate their theoretical claims. The experiments demonstrate that even with significantly fewer feature updates, the networks can achieve comparable accuracy to traditional SGD.

4. **Connection to Prior Work**: The authors effectively contextualize their work within existing literature on NTK theory and feature learning, integrating related findings while also addressing gaps in understanding finite networks.

5. **Clarity of Presentation**: The structure of the paper is clear and logically organized, making complex ideas more accessible. Figures and diagrams effectively illustrate key concepts and empirical results.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Limited Scope of Experiments**: The experiments are primarily confined to the CIFAR10 dataset, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Expanding the evaluation to include larger datasets or more complex architectures, such as transformers, would strengthen the contributions.

2. **Lack of Long-term Analysis**: While the current results provide insights into immediate generalization performance, the long-term implications of using fewer feature updates on model robustness and adaptability could be explored further.

3. **Potential for Overfitting to Experimental Conditions**: By focusing on specific architectures and training settings, there's a risk that the findings might overfit these conditions. Additional exploration of various conditions and hyperparameter settings would guard against this.

4. **Detailed Limitations and Future Work**: Although future work is mentioned, a more comprehensive discussion on limitations, including potential challenges in training larger models or variations in data distributions, would provide a more enriched perspective on the applicability of the proposed method.

5. **Analysis of Damping**: While the discussion on the connection between damping in optimization methods and feature learning is intriguing, the empirical evidence supporting this connection could be expanded to include diverse cases and further investigate its impact on performance consistently.

#### Conclusion

Overall, the paper presents a compelling investigation into the relationship between feature learning and network training dynamics through the iterative linearisation approach. Its combination of theoretical grounding and empirical validation positions it as a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, specifically in understanding deep networks' behavior. Addressing the weaknesses mentioned would improve the robustness of the paper and clarify the implications of the findings in broader contexts. I recommend acceptance with suggestions for minor revisions to enhance the scope of empirical work and address the outlined limitations.
