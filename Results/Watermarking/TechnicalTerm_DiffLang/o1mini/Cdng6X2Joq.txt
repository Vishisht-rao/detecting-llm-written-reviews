**Review of "A New, Physics-Based Continuous-Time Reinforcement Learning Algorithm with Performance Guarantees"**

**Summary:**
The authors present a novel continuous-time reinforcement learning (CT-RL) algorithm that is grounded in the principles of physics and is designed for control of affine nonlinear systems. Their approach integrates reference command input (RCI) as a probing noise mechanism to enhance learning dynamics. The authors claim to provide significant theoretical guarantees regarding learning convergence, solution optimality, and closed-loop stability. They argue that their RCI-based algorithm improves upon existing CT-RL methodologies, including adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) and fitted value iteration (FVI), particularly in applications demanding robustness and data efficiency.

**Strengths:**
1. **Theoretical Contributions:** The paper offers concrete theoretical guarantees, including convergence and closed-loop stability, that enhance the credibility of the proposed method. The reliance on the Kleinman algorithm's structure to derive results for nonlinear systems is a noteworthy innovation.
2. **Practical Relevance:** The algorithm's application to real-world problems, such as aerospace and robotics, highlights its relevance and potential impact. This aligns with the growing interest in efficient control strategies for complex dynamical systems.
3. **Comparative Evaluation:** The authors conduct extensive evaluations against established algorithms, demonstrating the performance benefits of their approach amidst modeling errors. The empirical results indicate that the proposed method significantly reduces controller error compared to standard LQR designs.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Algorithmic Complexity:** While the theoretical framework is robust, there is insufficient detail on the practical implementation of the algorithm. Specifics about the computational complexity and scalability of the RCI algorithm, especially in high-dimensional environments, could enhance its appeal to practitioners.
2. **Dependency on Physics Knowledge:** The reliance on a priori knowledge of the system's dynamics may limit the algorithm's applicability in scenarios where such knowledge is unavailable or costly to ascertain. Exploring methods to relax this requirement or frameworks that enable adaptive learning from the system dynamics would increase the algorithm's applicability.
3. **Limited Exploration of Alternative Cost Structures:** The study is constrained to Q-R cost structures. While this aligns well with many control problems, the ability to incorporate different cost formulations could broaden the algorithm’s applicability and enhance its flexibility.

**Clarity and Presentation:**
The manuscript is well-organized, following a clear structure that effectively guides the reader from theoretical foundations to empirical evaluations. However, there are instances of dense mathematical notation that may challenge readers unfamiliar with advanced control theory. Simplifying some of the presentation or adding explanatory figures could improve accessibility.

**References and Citations:**
The references are current and relevant. However, the paper would benefit from a more comprehensive review of prior work on continuous-time reinforcement learning, including how they specifically compare or relate to the proposed method's approach. Additionally, the mention of "long run average reward" as required for certain citations should be incorporated more thoroughly in context.

**Conclusion:**
This paper contributes meaningfully to the field of reinforcement learning by proposing a physics-based method with solid theoretical foundations and empirical validation. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in terms of implementation complexity and adaptability, the proposed algorithm shows promise for enhancing control of nonlinear systems. Strengthening practical applicability and broadening cost structures could further elevate this work. Overall, I recommend this submission for acceptance, contingent on addressing the highlighted concerns.
