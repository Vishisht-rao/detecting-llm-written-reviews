### Review of "LUMOS: Language Agents with Unified Formats, Modular Design, and Open-Source LLMs"

**Overall Impression:**
The paper presents a well-structured and innovative modular framework called LUMOS, which aims to enhance the capabilities of smaller language models in executing complex interactive tasks. The authors effectively demonstrate that a modular approach can yield competitive performance compared to larger models, thus addressing a pressing challenge in language agent research: achieving high functionality with smaller, open-source models.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach:**
   - The modular architecture consisting of planning, grounding, and execution modules is a significant strength. This design allows for clear delineation of tasks, making the agent's processing more understandable and interpretable. The introduction of two formulations—LUMOS-Onetime (LURMOS-O) and LUMOS-Iterative (LUMOS-I)—adds adaptability to the model, catering to both efficiency and flexibility.

2. **Comparison and Validation:**
   - The empirical results presented in the paper showcase LUMOS's competitive or superior performance against both large, closed models and contemporary open-source agents on various tasks, such as mathematical problem-solving and complex question answering. The execution of experiments against multiple baselines strengthens the validity of the findings.

3. **Robust Annotation Process:**
   - The methodology of using existing benchmarks to generate high-quality annotations for training the model is commendable. By leveraging LLMs to convert reasoning steps into a unified format, the authors ensure that the training data is rich and relevant.

4. **Generalizability:**
   - The paper provides evidence that LUMOS successfully generalizes to unseen tasks, a notable accomplishment in the field of language agents. This indicates the potential for practical application in diverse scenarios beyond the training datasets.

5. **Open Source Contribution:**
   - As a framework built on open-source LLMs, LUMOS contributes to the growing body of research that democratizes access to powerful language processing tools, which is vital for ongoing development in this area.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Clarity and Technical Depth:**
   - While the paper provides thorough explanations of the architecture and methods, some sections may benefit from more clarity and depth regarding certain technical components, such as the interactions between the modules during execution. Additional diagrams or flowcharts could enhance understanding.

2. **Limitations of the Model:**
   - The paper could benefit from a more explicit discussion of the limitations of the LUMOS framework. For instance, how does the modular design impact processing speed or resource consumption? Also, the potential drawbacks of using smaller models in scenarios where larger, more capable models might be preferred could be addressed.

3. **Detailed Comparison with Baselines:**
   - Although comparisons are made against various models, a more exhaustive analysis of the specific strengths and weaknesses of LUMOS relative to these baselines would provide deeper insights into its unique contributions. Further discussions on failure cases could also inform future improvements.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Expand on Limitations:**
   - A critical discussion of the model’s limitations and possible edge cases where it might not perform as well would strengthen the paper.

2. **Incorporate Additional Experiments:**
   - Including a broader range of tasks or benchmarks could further establish the generalizability and robustness of the LUMOS framework.

3. **Enhance Visualizations:**
   - Improved diagrams that showcase the interactions within the modular setup and the training process could facilitate better understanding among readers less familiar with the model's intricacies.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, the paper makes a substantial contribution to the field of language agents through the introduction of the LUMOS framework, showcasing innovative modular design and competitive performance using smaller models. With some refinements and a more explicit exploration of its limitations, the manuscript would serve as a strong foundation for advancing research in language agents and open-source LLM applications. The submission is recommended for acceptance with the proposed revisions.
