## Review of "LEFTOVER LUNCH: ADVANTAGE-BASED OFFLINE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR LANGUAGE MODELS"

### Summary

The paper introduces a novel approach called Advantage-Leftover Lunch RL (A-L OL), aimed at enhancing the performance of language models (LMs) using offline reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. The authors address the limitations of existing methods, particularly Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), such as reliance on new high-quality data and training instability. They propose a method that allows for training on pre-existing data while incorporating sequence-level reward functions. The efficacy of A-L OL is demonstrated through four language generation tasks, positioning it favorably against both online and other offline RL baselines.

### Strengths

1. **Novel Approach**: The paper presents a compelling new approach to offline RL for LMs that minimizes reliance on fresh data while incorporating human-designed scoring functions. This is crucial for real-world applications where collecting data can be challenging.

2. **Empirical Efficacy**: The experiments are robust, with a comprehensive evaluation across multiple tasks, demonstrating that A-L OL can achieve higher rewards and response diversity, and maintain safety and helpfulness compared to existing baselines.

3. **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is well-structured, clearly detailing the motivations behind the research, the proposed methodology, and the experimental results. The inclusion of pseudo-code for A-L OL enhances reproducibility.

4. **Comparison with Baselines**: The authors provide a rigorous comparison between A-L OL and state-of-the-art methods including PPO, DPO, and GOLD, showcasing significant advantages in terms of stability and efficiency.

5. **Release of Code**: The availability of the code on GitHub is a strong point, facilitating further research and application of A-L OL in the community.

### Weaknesses

1. **Limited Exploration of Variants**: While the authors introduce several variants of A-L OL, the theoretical motivation or special circumstances for using these variants (e.g., A-L OL KL or A-L OL seq.) could be elaborated further. It would be beneficial to include more extensive comparisons of all variants under varied conditions to substantiate their choices.

2. **Potential Ethical Considerations**: The paper briefly discusses the limitations and ethical implications of using A-L OL, particularly regarding training on suboptimal data. However, a deeper exploration of ethical ramifications, such as data sourcing and potential biases introduced into the LM’s outputs, would be valuable.

3. **Generalization**: There could be additional discussion on how well A-L OL generalizes beyond the specific tasks evaluated in the paper. Addressing how this method might perform across a wider variety of applications would provide deeper insights into its utility.

4. **Justification for Choices Made**: Certain choices, like the epsilon chosen for clipping importance weights, could use further justification or exploration. Additionally, the significance of achieving better diversity in responses in certain experiments compared to other baselines could be clarified.

### Recommendations

- **Expand on Theoretical Framework**: Emphasize theoretical grounding for key choices made in algorithm design. A section dedicated to discussing the implications of each design choice could strengthen the paper.

- **Ethical Considerations**: Expand ethical discussions and highlight best practices for future implementations to prevent misuse of trained models.

- **Future Work**: Briefly outline potential applications or adaptations of A-L OL in other domains (e.g., healthcare, education) and discuss how it might be adapted in those contexts.

### Conclusion

Overall, the paper presents a significant advance in offline reinforcement learning for language models, with a clear methodology, empirical validation, and potential for broad applicability. By addressing the highlighted weaknesses, the paper can further solidify its contributions and address important ethical considerations in AI research. Given its strengths, I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
