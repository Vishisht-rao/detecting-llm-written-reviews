**Review of "HIERARCHICAL EMPOWERMENT: TOWARDS TRACTABLE EMPOWERMENT-BASED SKILL LEARNING"**

**Summary:**
The authors propose a new framework, Hierarchical Empowerment, aimed at making the computation of empowerment-based skill learning more tractable. This is motivated by the challenges of optimizing mutual information for general-purpose agents capable of executing a large repertoire of skills. The framework presents two main contributions: (1) a variational lower bound on mutual information to compute empowerment over short horizons, and (2) a hierarchical architecture to extend this computation over longer time scales. Experiments are conducted in the simulated robotics domain to validate the claims, demonstrating that agents using this framework can cover significantly larger state spaces than previous approaches.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Contributions**: The introduction of the Goal-Conditioned Empowerment as a new variational lower bound on mutual information is a significant advancement. This approach addresses the inherent difficulties in mutual information optimization that have limited the performance of existing methods.
   
2. **Hierarchical Architecture**: The hierarchical design to facilitate long-term empowerment computation is well-motivated and theoretically sound. It effectively leverages concepts from Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning, allowing the framework to learn skills over exponentially longer time horizons while maintaining tractability.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The experimental results, particularly in the ant navigation tasks, provide strong evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The coverage of the state space demonstrated in the experiments is impressive and illustrates the capacity of the model to learn diverse skills.

4. **Clear Presentation**: The paper is well-structured and clearly articulates the motivation, methodology, and results. Figures and examples enhance understanding, particularly in illustrating the hierarchical architecture and the growth of goal spaces.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limitations Acknowledgment**: While the authors acknowledge the framework's limitations regarding the assumption of a uniform goal space distribution and reliance on the availability of transition dynamics, a more detailed exploration of these limitations and potential workarounds would strengthen the paper. It would be beneficial for future research directions to be outlined regarding adaptive goal space distributions.

2. **Generalizability Concerns**: The experimental validation occurs primarily in simulation environments (Ant and Half Cheetah), which may not fully reflect the complexities of real-world applications. The paper could benefit from discussions on how the model may perform in more complex, real-world scenarios.

3. **Detailed Ablation Studies**: Although ablation experiments are mentioned, a more in-depth analysis of how different components of the proposed method contribute to the overall performance could provide clearer insights into the robustness of the framework.

4. **Comparison with Recent Work**: While the paper references several relevant works, a more extensive comparison of results and methodologies from related recent studies in empowerment-based learning and hierarchical RL would provide contextual depth and demonstrate the relative advantages of Hierarchical Empowerment.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a compelling advancement in empowerment-based skill learning. The proposed Hierarchical Empowerment framework effectively addresses significant challenges in the field, and the experimental results illustrate its potential for learning diverse, effective skills. With minor improvements, particularly in addressing its limitations and comparing more broadly with existing work, this paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the area of Reinforcement Learning.

**Recommendation: Accept with Minor Revisions**.
