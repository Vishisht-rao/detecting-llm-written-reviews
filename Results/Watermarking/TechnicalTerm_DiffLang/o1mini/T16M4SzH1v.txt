### Review of "Distributional Bellman Operators over Mean Embeddings"

**Overview**
The paper proposes a novel framework for distributional reinforcement learning (RL) that employs mean embeddings of return distributions, leading to the sketch Bellman operator, which facilitates efficient updates without the need for complex imputation strategies. The authors provide theoretical convergence results and extensive experiments, demonstrating that their approach outperforms existing distributional methods in various tabular tasks and in reinforcement learning environments such as the Arcade Learning Environment.

**Strengths**
1. **Novel Contribution**: The introduction of mean embeddings instead of traditional distribution approximations offers a fresh perspective on distributional RL. The sketch Bellman operator simplifies the update process, reducing computational overhead significantly.
  
2. **Robust Theoretical Framework**: The authors present a well-structured theoretical framework, including convergence analysis and error propagation analysis, which is crucial for comprehending the efficacy of their methods. The results are rigorously derived and clearly articulated.

3. **Empirical Validation**: The paper includes a comprehensive set of experiments across multiple tasks, including both tabular environments and deep RL settings, which effectively validate the proposed framework's utility and performance. The results compare favorably against established baselines, demonstrating practical improvements.

4. **Broad Applicability**: The framework's potential for implementation in deep reinforcement learning contexts is well explored. The integration of the sketch framework with existing architectures, like DQN, shows promise for advancing the field further.

**Weaknesses**
1. **Complexity of Implementation**: While the proposed framework is theoretically appealing, it may be challenging to implement in practice, especially for practitioners who lack familiarity with statistical functionals and mean embeddings. More user-friendly explanations or guidelines could enhance accessibility.

2. **Limited Range of Experiments**: Although the experiments cover a broad range of environments, including tabular and deep RL contexts, the exploration is still somewhat constrained. Additional experiments in diverse settings, or more complicated environments, would contribute to a more comprehensive evaluation of the framework's robustness.

3. **Dependence on Feature Selection**: The performance of the proposed methods appears to be heavily dependent on the careful selection of feature maps. While this is acknowledged, providing more detailed guidance or automated strategies for feature selection could aid in practical applications.

4. **Discussion of Limitations**: While the authors present a compelling case for their methods, a more thorough discussion of potential limitations and scenarios where the proposed approach may struggle would provide a more balanced perspective. For instance, addressing when or why mean embeddings might fail to capture the richness of distributions compared to full distributional representations could be beneficial.

**Suggestions for Improvement**
- **Add Practical Implementation Guidelines**: Including pseudo-code or step-by-step guides for practitioners could make your methods more accessible.
- **Expand the Range of Experiments**: Testing the approach in a wider array of environments or real-world problems could further substantiate the claims of effectiveness.
- **Feature Selection Tools**: Consider developing tools or methods to aid in selecting or adjusting feature maps to enhance the user experience and applicability.
- **Limitations Discussion**: Expand the discussion on limitations to provide clarity for future research directions or adaptations of the proposed methods.

**Conclusion**
Overall, the paper makes a substantial contribution to the field of distributional reinforcement learning, offering both theoretical insights and practical improvements. With some refinements regarding accessibility and experimental breadth, it has the potential to significantly influence ongoing research and applications in reinforcement learning. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
