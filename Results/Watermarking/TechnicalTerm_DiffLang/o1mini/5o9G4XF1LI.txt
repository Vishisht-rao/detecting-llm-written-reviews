### Review of "Goodhart’s Law in Reinforcement Learning"

**Summary:**
The authors investigate the phenomenon known as Goodhart's law in the context of Reinforcement Learning (RL). They argue that when reward functions are used as proxies for more complex real-world objectives, optimizing these proxies can lead to suboptimal performance on the true objectives—a situation referred to as "Goodharting." The paper presents empirical evidence across various environments and theoretical insights to quantify the Goodhart effect and proposes an early stopping method to mitigate this risk. 

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Conceptual Framework:**
   - The authors provide a compelling perspective on reward misspecification through Goodhart's law, enriching the RL discourse by framing it alongside well-established economic theory.

2. **Methodological Rigor:**
   - The paper is well-structured, systematically investigating the Goodhart effect and providing a detailed geometric explanation for it. The use of occupancy measures and their relationships with reward functions are skillfully employed to substantiate the theoretical claims.

3. **Comprehensive Experimental Validation:**
   - The authors conduct extensive experiments across diverse environments (Gridworld, RandomMDP, TreeMDP) and report that around 19.3% of experiments exhibit Goodharting behavior. This empirical investigation is crucial for validating their theoretical insights.

4. **Innovative Solutions:**
   - The proposed early stopping algorithm is a significant contribution aimed at preventing Goodharting. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the optimality of this method, which could have substantial implications for practical RL applications.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Scalability and Practicality:**
   - While the theoretical framework and empirical findings are robust, the scalability of the early stopping method remains a concern. The computation of the projection onto the convex space can be expensive, particularly in high-dimensional settings, thus limiting practical applicability.

2. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - The authors primarily focus on the Normalized Drop Height (NDH) as a metric for Goodharting. While useful, a more diverse set of metrics could provide a richer characterization of the phenomenon. Additional qualitative insights into the reward trajectories and their implications might enhance the discussion.

3. **Parameter Sensitivity:**
   - While the paper does report on the parameter sensitivity of Goodharting, a more exhaustive investigation into how variations in training parameters, such as learning rates or reward sparsity, influence the effectiveness of the proposed methods would add robustness to the findings.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. **Enhance Discussion on Practical Implementations:**
   - The paper would benefit from a more in-depth discussion on how to implement the early stopping method in real-world RL applications, including potential trade-offs between true and proxy rewards.

2. **Broaden Empirical Analysis:**
   - Future experiments could include a wider variety of environments and reward structures to assess the robustness and generalizability of the findings.

3. **Address Limitations Explicitly:**
   - It would be advantageous for the authors to explicitly discuss the limitations and potential pitfalls of their methods, especially regarding situations where the proxy reward may differ drastically from the true reward.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning by addressing the crucial issue of reward misspecification through Goodhart's law. The theoretical insights and empirical validation put forth by the authors offer valuable guidance for both researchers and practitioners aiming to develop more robust RL systems. By refining the methods and providing clearer practical implications, this work could greatly influence future advancements in safe and effective RL applications.
