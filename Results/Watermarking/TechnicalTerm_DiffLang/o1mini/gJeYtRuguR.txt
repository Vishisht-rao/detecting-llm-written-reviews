**Review of "A Simple Romance Between Multi-Exit Vision Transformer and Token Reduction"**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces Multi-Exit Token Reduction (METR), a novel method that combines multi-exit architectures with token reduction techniques to enhance the efficiency of Vision Transformers (ViTs). The authors argue that the existing practice of relying on the attention score from the [CLS] token to assess token significance is flawed due to the arbitrary nature of attention allocation in early blocks of the transformer. By incorporating early-exit heads and self-distillation, they aim to provide improved task pressure on the [CLS] token, thus fostering more reliable token scoring. The authors conduct extensive experiments to validate the efficacy of their approach compared to existing state-of-the-art token reduction methods.

**Strengths:**

1. **Original Contribution:** The integration of multi-exit architectures with token reduction is an innovative approach, providing a fresh perspective on improving ViT performance while reducing computational costs. The notion of "early task pressure" is well-articulated and convincingly shown to enhance the learning dynamics of the [CLS] token.

2. **Experimental Validation:** The authors perform extensive experiments on standard datasets, notably ImageNet, demonstrating significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art token reduction methods. The paper provides quantitative results alongside qualitative analysis (e.g., visualizations of attention maps), reinforcing the claims made about the effectiveness of METR.

3. **Clear Theoretical Motivation:** The paper does a commendable job of explaining the theoretical limitations of current token reduction methods based on the [CLS] attention score. The discussion on how the lack of task pressure in early blocks compromises token significance is well-founded and logical.

4. **Comprehensive Analysis:** The authors thoroughly examine various facets of their approach, including ablation studies, thus providing insights into the contributions of each component (e.g., early exits, self-distillation). This increases the credibility of their results.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Lack of Baseline Comparisons Across More Diverse Tasks:** While the paper focuses on ImageNet, additional benchmarks or tasks would strengthen the argument for the generalizability of METR. Evaluating the method across various datasets or tasks within computer vision could demonstrate its broader applicability.

2. **Complexity of Implementation:** Though the proposed method shows promise, the complexity added by multi-exit architecture might deter practical applications in resource-constrained environments. The paper could provide a clearer discussion of how to manage this complexity effectively during implementation.

3. **Performance Metrics and Reporting:** While the paper presents performance improvements, the reporting could benefit from clearer descriptions of experimental setups (e.g., batch sizes, optimizers used, and details like learning rate schedules). This would help readers replicate the experiments more effectively.

4. **Discussion on Limitations:** The authors briefly touch upon the limitations of their approach but could expand on potential scenarios where METR might not perform as well, such as in configurations where fewer tokens are retained or under different input distributions.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a significant advancement in the field of vision transformers by merging multi-exit architectures with token reduction. The results are promising and suggest that the proposed METR method can effectively enhance computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. Addressing some of the noted weaknesses would elevate the work further and underpin its implications in practical applications. I recommend this paper for acceptance at ICLR 2024, with a few revisions to address the weaknesses highlighted.
