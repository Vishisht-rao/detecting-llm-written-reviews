**Review of "Learning to Optimize for Reinforcement Learning"**

**Summary:**
The authors present a novel approach aimed at overcoming the limitations of learned optimizers in reinforcement learning (RL), a domain where traditional optimization techniques often fall short. They identify three critical issues that complicate the process of learning optimizers for RL: the non-iid nature of agent-gradient distributions, the high bias and variance stemming from noisy interactions, and the instability associated with bilevel optimization. To address these challenges, the authors propose "Optim4RL," a learned optimizer that incorporates gradient processing, pipeline training, and an improved structure that mimics the behavior of adaptive optimizers without relying on human-designed features. The paper claims that Optim4RL can learn effective optimizers from scratch and generalize to complex tasks, demonstrated through experiments in standard gridworld environments and Brax simulation tasks.

**Strengths:**
1. **Identification of Key Challenges:** The recognition of unique challenges faced in optimizing RL tasks, particularly the non-stationary and non-iid characteristics of agent gradients, contributes to a deeper understanding of the field.
2. **Innovative Solutions:** The introduction of gradient processing and pipeline training as solutions to these challenges is a commendable approach. These methods address the inherent unpredictability of RL training, potentially improving the stability and efficiency of the learning process.
3. **Experimental Validation:** The experiments performed to validate the efficiency of Optim4RL provide compelling evidence of its strengths compared to both classic and learned optimizers. The ability to generalize from simple tasks to more complex environments is a significant achievement.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Scope of Experiments:** While the results on gridworlds and Brax tasks are promising, the training is limited to "toy tasks." To strengthen the claims made regarding generalization, further experiments in more diverse and realistic tasks would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the optimizer's effectiveness.
2. **Complexity of Optimizer Architecture:** Although the authors aim to reduce complexity by avoiding extensive human-designed features, the intricate structure of the Optim4RL may still benefit from simplifications or alternative formulations that could potentially yield similar performance with reduced computational requirements.
3. **Theoretical Foundation:** The paper lacks a rigorous theoretical analysis regarding the convergence properties or the expected behavior of Optim4RL in various settings. Incorporating such analyses would lend more credibility to the proposed methods and could help guide future work in the area.

**Minor Points:**
- The manuscript could benefit from clearer definitions or explanations of terms related to optimization (e.g., "pipeline training" and "gradient processing") early in the exposition to aid readers unfamiliar with the concepts.
- The presentation of results could be enhanced through clearer visuals and more detailed explanations in the associated figures, especially those showing gradient distributions and performance metrics across tasks.
- It would be helpful to include more discussion on the implications of the findings, especially concerning practical applications of Optim4RL in real-world RL scenarios.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of RL optimization through the development of a learned optimizer tailored for the peculiarities of reinforcement learning tasks. The innovative integration of multiple strategies shows potential but would benefit from further validation and exploration. I recommend a revision that addresses the identified weaknesses and minor points, enhancing the clarity and impact of the research presented.
