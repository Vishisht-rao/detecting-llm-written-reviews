**Review of "Learning to Compute Gröbner Bases"**

---

**Summary:**

The paper presents a novel approach to computing Gröbner bases using transformer models, marking a significant advance in the intersection of computational algebra and machine learning. It addresses the computational challenges associated with Gröbner bases, known for their NP-hard complexity, particularly in the number of variables involved. The authors propose two new algebraic problems: the random generation of Gröbner bases and a backward transformation of Gröbner bases into non-Gröbner polynomial systems. The experimental results demonstrate that their dataset generation method is substantially faster than naive approaches, providing a foundation for training machine learning models that can compute Gröbner bases with notable accuracy.

**Strengths:**

1. **Highly Relevant Topic**: The study addresses a critical area in computational algebra where existing methods face empirical limitations due to the inherent complexity of the problem.
   
2. **Novel Contributions**: The introduction of the backward Gröbner problem and efficient algorithms for random generation of Gröbner bases presents a fresh perspective for future research in computational algebra.

3. **Effective Methodology**: The use of transformers in learning to compute mathematical tasks has been promising in previous work; this paper effectively extends that framework to a challenging algebraic problem.

4. **Experimental Validation**: The experiments provide solid evidence that the proposed methods outperform classical approaches, presenting detailed runtime comparisons and achieving higher efficiencies in dataset generation.

5. **Clear Potential for Impact**: The findings indicate that transformers can tackle NP-hard problems, which could open new avenues in both machine learning and algebra.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Specialization of Results**: The focus on zero-dimensional radical ideals, while practical, limits the general applicability of the algorithms proposed. Future work might consider extending these methods to more general cases.

2. **Scalability Considerations**: Although the paper claims significant speed improvements, the actual scalability of the proposed methods for large-scale systems or more complicated polynomial structures is not fully addressed.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**: The paper could benefit from more comprehensive accuracy metrics beyond simple correctness. For instance, measuring the time it takes for the transformer to generate and compute solutions in a real-world context may provide further clarity on the performance benefits.

4. **Theoretical Justifications**: While empirical results support the claims, deeper theoretical insights into why the methods work effectively could bolster the paper's arguments. An exploration of the algebraic properties leveraged by the transformers would enhance understanding.

5. **Training Procedure Details**: More transparency regarding the training procedures, such as the selection criteria for hyperparameters and how they were tuned, would improve reproducibility and the robustness of the findings.

**Overall Evaluation:**

This paper represents a significant advancement in applying machine learning techniques to computational algebra, specifically in the computation of Gröbner bases via transformers. It thoughtfully tackles a complex problem with novel solutions, and the empirical validations show promise for practical applications. 

I recommend acceptance of this paper with minor revisions addressing the points raised regarding scalability, theoretical insights, and clarity in the training methodology. The interplay between algebra and machine learning presented here could drive future research, making this paper a valuable contribution to the ICLR 2024 conference.
