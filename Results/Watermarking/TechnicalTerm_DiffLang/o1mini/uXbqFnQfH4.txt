**Review of "MULTI-OBJECTIVE MULTI-SOLUTION TRANSPORT (MosT)"**

**Summary:**
The manuscript presents a novel approach to multi-objective optimization (MOO) called Multi-objective Multi-solution Transport (MosT). It specifically addresses scenarios where the number of objectives (n) far exceeds the number of solutions (m), a situation common in many machine learning applications such as federated learning and fairness-accuracy trade-offs. The authors introduce an innovative framework that frames the problem as a bi-level optimization task, utilizing optimal transport (OT) to define the relationship between objectives and solutions. The proposed methodology is demonstrated to outperform existing methods in terms of solution quality and diversity across several benchmark tasks.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty and Relevance:** The paper addresses a significant and underexplored challenge in the field of MOO, particularly in high-dimensional cases where n ≫ m. The use of OT for matching objectives to solutions is both innovative and timely.
   
2. **Theoretical Framework:** The authors provide a solid theoretical foundation for the proposed method, including convergence proofs for both convex and non-convex cases, which increases the credibility of their claims.

3. **Extensive Experiments:** The experimentations span various domains, including federated learning and fairness-accuracy trade-offs. Results show consistent improvement over baseline methods, illustrating the practical applicability and effectiveness of MosT.

4. **Clear Methodological Contributions:** The paper is well-organized, clearly laying out the algorithmic components of MosT along with a curriculum learning approach that enhances model specialization.

5. **Empirical Validation:** Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets and practical applications substantiate the theoretical claims, providing strong evidence for the advantages of MosT over existing techniques.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity of Implementation:** While the authors provide a well-detailed algorithmic description, the actual implementation details could be more extensively discussed. The complexity involved in ensuring optimal transport may pose practical challenges for some researchers without a strong computational background.

2. **Limited Discussion on Computational Efficiency:** While the authors mention computational costs related to the increase in the number of models, a more in-depth analysis of the trade-offs between the number of solutions and performance (especially in relation to computational burden) would enhance the discussion.

3. **Diverse Evaluation Metrics:** Although the paper employs relevant evaluation metrics, the choice of metrics could be broadened to include additional robustness checks, especially considering the varying characteristics of the datasets used. For instance, including precision, recall, or F1-score could enrich the analysis of model performance in specific applications.

4. **More Extensive Comparison with State-of-the-Art Methods:** The paper could benefit from a more comparative analysis against not only MOO methods but also recent advancements in related areas (e.g., multi-task learning frameworks). This could help delineate the unique strengths of MosT more clearly. 

5. **Sensitivity Analysis:** Insights into how hyperparameters influence the final outcomes could further validate the method’s robustness. An ablation study detailing how variations in key parameters (including α and β values) impact performance would provide comprehensible guidance for practitioners.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of multi-objective optimization by introducing MosT, which effectively handles scenarios with a disproportionate number of objectives to solutions. The solid theoretical basis, combined with rigorous empirical validation, establishes the method's potential. Addressing the highlighted weaknesses through a detailed exploration of implementation challenges, computational efficiency, evaluation metrics, and comparative analysis with contemporary approaches will ultimately strengthen the contributions of this work.
