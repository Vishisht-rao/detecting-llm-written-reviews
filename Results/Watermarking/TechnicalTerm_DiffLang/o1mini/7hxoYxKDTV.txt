**Review of "CONTINUOUS MULTIPLE IMAGE OUTPAINTING IN ONE-STEP VIA POSITIONAL QUERY AND A DIFFUSION-BASED APPROACH" by Shaofeng Zhang et al.**

**Summary:**
The authors present a novel approach, termed PQDiff, to address the problem of image outpainting, which involves generating image content beyond the original boundaries of a specified sub-image. The key innovations include the capability for continuous and arbitrary multiple outpainting in a single step, contrasting with existing methods that typically require multiple iterations for discrete multiples. The method utilizes positional queries alongside a diffusion-based generator, and claims to outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on established benchmarks.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach**: The introduction of the positional query mechanism for image outpainting is a significant contribution to the field, as it permits arbitrary scaling without retraining the model.
2. **Single-Step Outpainting**: Achieving outpainting in one step is a crucial improvement over previous methods, which necessitate multiple passes through the model to achieve large-scale expansions. This advancement not only enhances efficiency but also aligns with practical application needs.
3. **Competitive Results**: The paper reports promising results, including favorable FID scores and reduced time for outpainting compared to SOTA methods. The quantitative metrics presented across the Scenery, Building Facades, and WikiArts datasets support the efficacy of the proposed method.
4. **Comprehensive Experimental Analysis**: The authors provide detailed ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of different components of their model, including the impact of crop ratios and types of positional embeddings.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Clarity and Organization**: While the paper is rich in technical details, the writing can be convoluted at times, leading to potential confusion regarding key concepts. For example, the introduction could benefit from a clearer delineation of the main innovations and their implications for the field.
2. **Metric Limitations**: The reliance on FID and IS as performance metrics may be limiting. While these metrics are standard in the field, they have been criticized for their ability to fully capture image quality and diversity. In addition, while the paper discusses PSNR, it downplays its relevance, which could provide additional insights into model performance.
3. **Lack of Extensive Comparative Analysis**: Although the paper compares PQDiff to existing methods, a deeper analysis of the motivations behind design choices (e.g., positional embedding types) alongside other models could enhance the reader's understanding of the advancements made.
4. **Ethical Considerations**: While the authors briefly mention potential ethical concerns related to the technology's usage, further exploration of implications in the context of generative models could bolster their discussion.

**Minor Remarks:**
- The dataset selection and preprocessing steps are well-documented, yet the paper might benefit from discussing potential biases in the selected datasets that could impact generalizability.
- Including additional qualitative comparisons would further strengthen the claims about the visual fidelity and contextual consistency of the generated images.
- The proposed method's computational efficiency could be highlighted more robustly, specifically in terms of practical usability for real-world applications.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper presents a significant step forward in the field of image outpainting through innovative methodology and promising results. The contributions made by the introduction of positional queries and the ability for continuous and efficient image expansion are noteworthy. However, improvements in writing clarity, metric discussion, and ethical considerations will enhance the impact of the paper. I recommend it for acceptance with the potential for clarifications and revisions to better address these points.
