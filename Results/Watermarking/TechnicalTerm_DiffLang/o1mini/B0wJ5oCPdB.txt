### Review of "CHAIN-OF-SYMBOL PROMPTING FOR SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS IN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS"

#### Overview
The paper introduces the Chain-of-Symbol (COS) prompting technique, aimed at improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) in tasks involving complex spatial understanding and planning. The authors argue that current approaches using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting often struggle with spatial reasoning due to the inherent complexities in language representations. Through the proposed method, they replace natural language descriptions of spatial relationships with condensed symbolic representations. The findings, based on extensive experiments across various spatial planning tasks, suggest significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency with COS compared to traditional CoT methods.

#### Strengths
1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The approach of using symbolic representations in the context of LLMs is relatively underexplored. This contributes to the growing body of knowledge on LLM capabilities and expands the potential application areas for these technologies.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The paper provides a detailed evaluation across multiple spatial planning tasks, including Brick World, NLVR-based Manipulation, and Natural Language Navigation. The results are quantitatively impressive, showing up to a 60.8% increase in accuracy on certain tasks.

3. **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is generally well-structured. Each section logically flows from one to the next, and the use of figures to illustrate experimental setups and results is helpful for comprehension.

4. **Rigorous Experimentation**: The authors present thorough experimentation with various settings (such as 1D and 2D scenarios), token usage comparisons, and analyses of different symbols used in COS. This thoroughness adds credibility to their findings.

5. **Real-World Relevance**: Addressing spatial understanding in LLMs has practical implications, as spatial reasoning is crucial in many real-world applications, including robotics and human-computer interaction.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Limited Model Selection**: The experiments were conducted using only two models (ChatGPT and Text-Davinci-003). While these models are prominent, the generalizability of the findings to other LLM architectures remains to be explored. Expanding the model selection could offer broader insights into the robustness of COS.

2. **Potential Overreliance on Symbols**: The paper speculates that the success of COS might largely stem from its ability to eliminate irrelevant information through concise symbolic representations. However, there is limited discussion regarding scenarios where symbols may not adequately capture the complexities of certain spatial relationships.

3. **Contextual Understanding**: While COS appears to perform well in defined tasks, the paper does not extensively discuss its application to more dynamic, less structured environments where spatial cues might be ambiguous or continuously changing.

4. **Ethical Considerations**: The limitations section touches on broader impacts but could benefit from a more in-depth reflection on potential ethical implications, including biases that may arise from symbolic representations in diverse contexts.

5. **Language Diversity**: The evaluation of COS on tasks given in languages other than English demonstrates some potential, but further analysis on its performance across multilingual representations would strengthen the argument about its robustness.

#### Suggestions for Improvement
1. **Explore Additional Models**: Future work should include a broader range of LLMs, particularly focusing on cutting-edge architectures, to validate COS further.

2. **Broaden Contextual Applications**: Investigate how COS might perform in unstructured environments or tasks requiring a more nuanced understanding of physical context.

3. **Deeper Ethical Analysis**: A dedicated section addressing potential ethical considerations and societal impact, particularly concerning biases in symbol use and understanding across cultures, could enrich the paper.

4. **Expand on Language Robustness**: More comprehensive studies on the utility and efficacy of COS across multiple languages and cultural contexts would provide a better understanding of its applicability.

#### Conclusion
Overall, the paper presents a compelling argument for the efficacy of Chain-of-Symbol prompting in enhancing spatial reasoning in LLMs. The insights and results could pave the way for future improvements in how machines understand and interact with complex spatial instructions. While the foundational work is solid, addressing the outlined weaknesses and suggestions could further enhance the paper's contributions to the field.
