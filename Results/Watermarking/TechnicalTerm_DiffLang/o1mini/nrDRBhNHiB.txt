**Review of the Paper: "A Multiobjective Continuation Method to Compute the Regularization Path of Deep Neural Networks"**

**Overview:**
The paper presents a novel algorithm aimed at computing the regularization path for deep neural networks (DNNs) using a multiobjective optimization approach. This work seeks to efficiently balance two conflicting objectives: empirical loss and ℓ1 regularization, ultimately aiming to encourage sparsity in neural network architectures. The authors claim to extend the concept of regularization paths from linear models to high-dimensional nonlinear problems, which they argue is a first in this field. 

**Strengths:**
1. **Relevance and Importance**: The paper addresses a critical gap in the literature regarding the optimization of DNN architectures for sparsity and interpretability, both of which are increasingly necessary in the landscape of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
   
2. **Novel Contribution**: The introduction of a continuation method adapted to compute the entire Pareto front for non-convex problems with millions of parameters is an innovative step. The algorithms proposed could potentially advance the capabilities of DNN training, paving the way for more resource-efficient models.

3. **Empirical Validation**: The authors provide a robust set of numerical experiments across different datasets (Iris, MNIST, CIFAR-10) to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of their algorithm. The comparisons made against standard weighted sum approaches reinforce the claims of improvement and efficiency.

4. **Depth of Related Work**: The paper shows a comprehensive understanding of the existing literature, providing appropriate context and citations that solidify the authors' arguments regarding the limitations of past approaches and the innovative nature of their method.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity and Clarity**: While the algorithm appears to be a promising development, certain sections of the paper, particularly the mathematical definitions and algorithm descriptions, can be difficult to follow for readers who may not be specialized in multiobjective optimization. The authors could benefit from clarifying these sections, perhaps through additional illustrations or simplified explanations.

2. **Scalability**: Although the paper claims efficiency in high-dimensional settings, it would be useful to provide more concrete estimates of the computational cost compared to traditional methods, particularly as dataset sizes continue to grow in machine learning applications.

3. **Generality of Results**: The conclusion suggests potential future work involving more objectives. However, it remains to be seen if the proposed algorithm will maintain effectiveness when scaling to problems with greater complexity (more objectives). The authors should discuss this point and its implications for generalizability.

4. **Overfitting Handling**: The results indicate that non-sparse networks tend to overfit, which is a known issue in DNN training. The approach suggests monitoring the slope of the Pareto front as an early stopping criterion, but additional discussion on implementation or any empirical data supporting this would enhance the robustness of this claim.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, the paper "A Multiobjective Continuation Method to Compute the Regularization Path of Deep Neural Networks" makes a meaningful contribution to the field of machine learning by advancing the tools available for optimizing neural networks' structure while maintaining efficiency and interpretability. While it has some areas needing refinement in terms of clarity and generalizability, the novel approach and empirical results present a solid foundation for further exploration and development. I recommend acceptance pending minor revisions to improve clarity and addressing the noted considerations.
