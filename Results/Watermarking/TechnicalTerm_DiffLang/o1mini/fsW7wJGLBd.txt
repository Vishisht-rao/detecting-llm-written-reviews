**Review of "Tensor Trust: Interpretable Prompt Injection Attacks from an Online Game"**

1. **Summary of Contributions**:
   The paper presents a novel dataset of over 563,000 prompt injection attacks and 118,000 defenses collected from a web game called Tensor Trust. This dataset is particularly notable for including human-generated input rather than relying solely on automated prompt generation. The authors also introduce a benchmarking framework for evaluating the resistance of large language models (LLMs) to two types of prompt injection attacks: prompt extraction and prompt hijacking. The dataset and its accompanying benchmarks aim to shed light on the vulnerabilities of current instruction-following LLMs.

2. **Strengths**:
   - **Innovative Dataset**: The introduction of a large scale, human-generated dataset is a significant contribution to the field. It allows for a richer exploration of prompt injection attacks and defenses, which are critical for improving the robustness of LLMs.
   - **Interpretable Structure**: The authors emphasize the interpretable nature of the attacks, making it easier for researchers and practitioners to understand the underlying strategies.
   - **Comprehensive Analysis**: The qualitative analysis presented in the paper highlights common failure modes in LLMs, providing actionable insights into how these models can be improved.
   - **Benchmark Development**: The benchmarks to evaluate LLM robustness against prompt injection attacks are well-structured and relevant, filling a gap in existing literature that has largely focused on either smaller datasets or automated attacks.

3. **Weaknesses**:
   - **Dataset Limitations**: While the dataset is extensive, its generalizability may be limited to the specific context of the game. Future work should explore how these findings transfer to real-world applications outside of this controlled environment.
   - **Comparative Analysis**: Although the paper evaluates multiple LLMs, a more detailed comparative analysis with existing prompt injection datasets or techniques would strengthen the argument for the effectiveness of the Tensor Trust dataset.
   - **Ethical Considerations**: The paper does engage in discussions around the security implications of prompt injection attacks, yet a more thorough exploration of the ethical ramifications of the research, particularly in how it might be misused, would bolster its scholarly rigor.

4. **Clarity and Presentation**:
   The paper is generally well-written, with a logical structure that guides the reader through the introduction, methodology, results, and implications of the research. Figures and tables are clear and relevant, enhancing the reader's understanding of the datasets and results.

5. **Technical Rigor**:
   The authors provide sufficient methodological detail, allowing for the reproducibility of their experimental setup. The use of established metrics for evaluating hijacking and extraction robustness lends credibility to their results.

6. **Conclusion**:
   Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the understanding of prompt injection vulnerabilities in LLMs. By combining a unique dataset with benchmarks that assess model robustness, the authors provide a solid foundation for future research in this important area of AI safety and security. However, the limitations regarding the applicability of the findings in real-world settings and a more nuanced discussion of ethical implications present areas for improvement.

**Recommendation**: 
This paper should be accepted for presentation at ICLR 2024, with minor revisions suggested particularly around the ethical implications of their work and a more robust comparative analysis of their dataset with existing literature.
