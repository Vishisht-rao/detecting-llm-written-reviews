**Review of "Continual Offline Reinforcement Learning: Viadiffusion-Based Dual Generative Replay"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a new framework called CuGRO (Continual learning via diffusion-based dual Generative Replay for Offline RL) to address the challenges associated with continual offline reinforcement learning (CORL). The proposed approach aims to balance forward transfer and mitigate catastrophic forgetting through a dual generative replay mechanism. The authors decouple the continual learning policy into a diffusion-based generative behavior model and an action evaluation model, allowing effective generation of high-fidelity pseudo-samples from previously learned tasks. 

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty and Contribution:** The introduction of a dual generative replay mechanism that leverages diffusion models is innovative. The attempt to address both forward transfer and catastrophic forgetting in CORL is commendable as these are critical challenges in reinforcement learning.
  
2. **High Fidelity Replay:** The utilization of diffusion models for generating high-fidelity samples presents a promising direction, especially considering previous models have struggled with distribution mismatches in offline scenarios. It is well-articulated that high-quality sample generation can lead to improved performance in continual learning settings.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The experimental evaluation on four different benchmarks using the MuJoCo simulator provides a thorough assessment of the proposed approach. The authors' results show promising performance improvements, demonstrating the validity of their claims regarding reduced forgetting and enhanced forward transfer.

4. **Clear Presentation:** The paper is reasonably well-structured with a logical flow, allowing readers to follow the methodology from formulation through to implementation and results. 

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Handling of Noise and Samples:** While the paper highlights the importance of high-fidelity samples, it is noted that the model's performance varies across tasks such as Hopper-Vel, which raises questions about robustness. A more in-depth discussion on mitigating the risks of catastrophic failures in learning coupled with aspects like sample quality could strengthen the findings.

2. **Limited Focus on Computational Efficiency:** The dual generator system potentially doubles the computational burden during both training and inference. Since addressing computational efficiency is important in practical applications, the authors should discuss the resource implications, especially when scaling to larger environments or tasks.

3. **Lack of Baseline Comparisons:** While the paper compares against the None and Noise baselines, it might benefit from additional baseline methods to provide context on how CuGRO performs compared to other state-of-the-art continual learning approaches, specifically those that also target offline settings.

4. **Future Work and Limitations:** Although future avenues are mentioned, a more detailed discussion about the limitations of the current approach and specific future research directions would help provide a clearer roadmap for subsequent developments.

**Overall Impression:**
The paper introduces an intriguing framework that combines advances in diffusion modeling with ongoing research in continual offline reinforcement learning. While it presents innovative strategies and demonstrates promising results, there are areas where robustness, efficiency, and comparative context could be elaborated upon. Overall, the paper contributes valuable insights to the field and is a worthwhile submission for ICLR 2024. I encourage the authors to address the highlighted concerns to strengthen their work further. 

**Recommendation:** Accept with minor revisions.
