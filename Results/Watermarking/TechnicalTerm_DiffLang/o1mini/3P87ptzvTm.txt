### Review of "Optimal Multiple Transport with Applications to Visual Matching, Model Fusion and Beyond"

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel generalization of optimal transport (OT) for scenarios involving multiple probability measures, termed Optimal Multiple Transport (OMT). The authors construct formulations for both Monge and Kantorovich OT, with an emphasis on maintaining cycle-consistency among the transportation mappings. The proposed ROMT-Sinkhorn algorithm, built upon an iterative Sinkhorn approach, offers an efficient solution to the formulated OMT problem. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated through applications in visual multi-point matching (MPM) and multi-model fusion (MMF), as well as a new formulation for solving the traveling salesman problem (TSP) using a probabilistic approach. The experimental results show competitive performance compared to existing methods, demonstrating the utility and versatility of the proposed framework.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Contribution:** The introduction of Optimal Multiple Transport (OMT) fills a critical gap in the literature on OT by addressing scenarios involving more than two distributions. This is particularly relevant for real-world applications where multiple sources of data or models need to be aligned.

2. **Cycle-Consistency Constraints:** The incorporation of cycle-consistency into the transportation framework adds a layer of robustness, ensuring that the mappings produce coherent results across multiple probability measures. This is a significant advancement that strengthens the applicability of OT in complex scenarios.

3. **Algorithmic Innovation:** The development of the ROMT-Sinkhorn algorithm is a key contribution. By leveraging entropic and cycle-consistency regularization, the algorithm presents a unique approach to obtaining approximately optimal solutions, which is critical in high-dimensional settings.

4. **Empirical Validation:** The paper provides thorough empirical evaluations in two distinct domains, demonstrating the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method. The results indicate that the ROMT-Sinkhorn algorithm achieves competitive accuracy compared to existing methods while effectively addressing the cycle-consistency problem.

5. **Additional Insights:** The exploration of TSP-OMT as a side product opens up new avenues for applying OMT in combinatorial optimization problems, showcasing the flexibility of the proposed methodology.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity of Implementation:** The introduction of multiple hyperparameters (e.g., for regularization) may complicate the implementation of the ROMT-Sinkhorn algorithm. This could deter practitioners who may find tuning these parameters challenging without extensive experimentation or guidance.

2. **Potential for Overfitting:** While the empirical results are compelling, there may be a risk of overfitting due to the complexity of the models used (e.g., neural networks for feature extraction). More rigorous cross-validation or testing on diverse datasets would help assess the generalizability of the findings.

3. **Clarifications on Limitations:** The paper briefly mentions the limitations of the proposed method, particularly relating to the introduction of additional hyperparameters. However, a more comprehensive discussion of potential drawbacks or failure cases would provide a clearer understanding of the algorithm's robustness.

4. **Comparative Analysis:** While the paper presents results against several existing methods, a more detailed comparative analysis, including a wider range of baselines, could strengthen the contribution and validate the superiority of the proposed approach.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper presents a significant advancement in the field of optimal transport by introducing a generalized framework applicable to multiple distributions. The proposed ROMT-Sinkhorn algorithm shows promise with empirical evidence supporting its effectiveness in visual matching and model fusion tasks. Despite a few drawbacks related to implementation complexity and potential generalization concerns, the contributions merit publication and have the potential to influence further research in optimal transport and its applications. Future work could benefit from addressing the limitations outlined and exploring further applications of OMT in other domains.
