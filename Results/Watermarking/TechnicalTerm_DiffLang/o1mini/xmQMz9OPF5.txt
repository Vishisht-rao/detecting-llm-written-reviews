### Review of "Exploring Target Representations for Masked Autoencoders"

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel approach to training masked autoencoders through a multi-stage masked knowledge distillation pipeline, named dBOT, which does not require careful selection of target representations. The authors argue that a randomly initialized model can serve effectively as a teacher, achieving performance comparable to existing self-supervised methods. The method is evaluated across a variety of downstream tasks, including classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, demonstrating state-of-the-art results.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach**: The introduction of the dBOT framework represents a substantive addition to the self-supervised learning landscape. The ability to leverage random initialization as a teacher alleviates the burden of pre-training and careful target representation design.
  
2. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The authors conduct extensive experiments validating their method across diverse tasks and architectures, showcasing robustness and adaptability. The results on ImageNet-1K, COCO, and ADE20K further bolster the claims about dBOT's effectiveness.

3. **Clear Motivation and Hypothesis**: The paper presents a convincingly articulated hypothesis that the design of target representations might not be as crucial in a multi-stage training approach, which is empirically validated through systematic experiments.

4. **Public Availability of Code and Models**: The authors have made their code and pre-trained models publicly available, enhancing reproducibility and encouraging further research in the area.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Lack of Theoretical Justification**: While the empirical results are compelling, the paper lacks a rigorous theoretical framework to explain why randomly initialized teachers perform effectively in masked knowledge distillation. Addressing this gap could strengthen the overall contribution of the paper.

2. **Potential Overlook of Learning Dynamics**: The paper posits that teacher networks do not matter significantly when employing multi-stage distillation, but this might oversimplify the complex dynamics of learning. The impact of various architectures on the feature learning process could be explored in greater depth.

3. **Limited Discussion on Scalability and Efficiency**: Although training times are discussed, a clearer breakdown of the efficiency gains in practice when using the proposed method versus existing methods (especially in production or on larger datasets) would provide more insight into its applicability in real-world scenarios.

4. **Comparative Context**: While the paper compares dBOT to traditional methods, more context could be provided on how the targets used in existing self-supervised methods conceptualize different types of knowledge. Discussing these features could provide clarity on why the authors’ findings are noteworthy.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, "Exploring Target Representations for Masked Autoencoders" presents an exciting and impactful research direction in self-supervised visual representation learning. The findings suggest a re-evaluation of existing practices regarding target representation selection. While the empirical contributions are strongly justified, the paper would benefit from additional theoretical depth and practical context, particularly in discussing the implications of using a simpler teacher model. Future exploration into scaling the approach and its performance on larger datasets will be invaluable in understanding the full potential of this method. 

**Recommendation:**
I recommend acceptance of this paper with minor revisions to address the theoretical considerations, discussion of the learning dynamics, and provide additional context for the comparative analysis.
