**Review of the Paper "MULTI-MODAL LATENT DIFFUSION"**

**Summary:**
The manuscript presents a novel approach termed Multi-modal Latent Diffusion (MLD) aimed at improving the coherence and quality of multi-modal generative models, specifically focusing on the limitations of multi-modal Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). The authors identify a coherence-quality tradeoff inherent in existing approaches and propose a solution that utilizes independently trained uni-modal deterministic autoencoders along with a masked diffusion model. The results demonstrate substantial improvements in generative performance across multiple benchmarks, showcasing both generative quality and coherence.

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear Motivation and Novelty:** The paper effectively explains the limitations of existing multi-modal VAE approaches regarding coherence and quality, which provides strong motivation for the proposed method. The combination of independently trained autoencoders and a diffusion model is a novel contribution to the field that advances the understanding of multi-modal generation.
  
2. **Extensive Experiments:** The authors conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation comparing MLD to a wide range of existing models, including MUVAEs, MOPOE, MMVAE, and others. The benchmarks are appropriate, and the quantitative and qualitative results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.

3. **Robustness in Results:** The paper reports consistent performance across various datasets with different characteristics, such as MNIST-SVHN, MHD, POLYMNIST, and CUB. This indicates that MLD is robust and versatile, capable of handling multi-modal tasks in diverse contexts.

4. **Well-Structured and Detailed:** The manuscript is well-organized, with a logical flow from the introduction through to the experimental results. The technical details, such as the formulation of the training objectives, loss functions, and the design of the score-based diffusion process, are clearly explained and well-supported.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Discussion of Computational Complexity:** While the authors present significant performance improvements, the computational cost associated with training multiple deterministic autoencoders and the additional complexity from the masked diffusion model could be discussed in more detail. This information is essential for practitioners considering the adoption of the proposed method.

2. **Appendix Overload:** The appendix contains vast amounts of details that, while useful, may overwhelm readers. The essential findings and methods could be summarized more succinctly within the main text, leaving critical supplementary details in the appendix for interested readers.

3. **Potential for Further Insights on Generalization:** Although the results indicate good performance on diverse datasets, insights into how the model might generalize to new, unseen modalities or the potential limitations when dealing with highly disparate modalities could enrich the discussion.

4. **Statistical Analysis and Significance Testing:** More attention to statistical analysis, including significance testing for the reported differences in performance metrics across models, would lend additional credibility to the claims of superiority.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. Include a discussion around the computational efficiency and practicality of the model when scaled to larger datasets or additional modalities.
2. Condense the methodology section within the main text, focusing on key aspects while providing the exhaustive experimental details solely in the appendix.
3. Elaborate on limitations related to generalization or potential challenges that might arise with the proposed approach in more complex real-world applications.
4. Incorporate statistical validation methods to support claims of improved performance.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper makes a strong contribution to the field of multi-modal generative modeling. By addressing significant limitations of existing VAEs and presenting a new methodology backed by extensive empirical evidence, the authors have provided a valuable framework for future research. However, minor clarifications regarding computational feasibility and statistical analysis would enhance the manuscript's quality. This work is well-suited for presentation at the ICLR 2024 conference, and I recommend its acceptance, contingent upon addressing the highlighted concerns.
