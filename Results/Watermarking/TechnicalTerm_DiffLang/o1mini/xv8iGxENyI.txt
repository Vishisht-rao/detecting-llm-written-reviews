**Review of "Threaten Spiking Neural Networks Through Combining Rate and Temporal Information"**

**Summary:**
The paper proposes a novel hybrid adversarial attack method called HART (Hybrid Adversarial attack based on Rate and Temporal information) targeted at Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). The authors motivate their proposal by highlighting the under-explored vulnerability of SNNs under adversarial conditions, emphasizing that both rate and temporal information are present in these networks. The key contributions include a theoretical analysis of rate and temporal information, the introduction of a new methodology (HART) that effectively combines both types of information for adversarial attacks, and extensive experimental validation showcasing the superiority of HART across multiple datasets and scenarios.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach:**
   The integration of rate and temporal information for adversarial attacks on SNNs is a novel and compelling idea. The authors effectively highlight a significant gap in current research regarding the vulnerability of SNNs.

2. **Theoretical Foundation:**
   The paper provides a solid theoretical background on the role of rate and temporal information in SNNs, including detailed derivations and proofs that enhance the credibility of the proposed methods.

3. **Extensive Experimental Validation:**
   The authors conduct comprehensive experiments across different scenarios (white-box and black-box scenarios) and datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR10-DVS). The results consistently demonstrate the efficacy of HART compared to previous state-of-the-art techniques, indicating the robustness and generalization capabilities of the proposed method.

4. **Clarity and Structure:**
   The paper is well-organized with clear sections delineating the introduction, methodology, experiments, and conclusions. The figures and tables provide essential visual support for the findings.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Need for More Context:**
   While the paper argues for the necessity of integrating rate and temporal information, it would benefit from a more in-depth discussion on the implications of these findings for the broader field of SNNs and adversarial machine learning. This includes potential applications and impacts on real-world scenarios where SNNs are deployed.

2. **Lack of Baseline Comparisons:**
   Although the authors compare HART to several existing adversarial methods, a more detailed analysis showing exactly how these methods differ both conceptually and quantitatively in various contexts would strengthen the argument for the added value of HART.

3. **Details on Implementation:**
   The explained implementation details of the HART attack could be expanded upon. Providing more specific information regarding hyperparameter tuning, especially for the γ parameter, could help practitioners replicate and build upon this work.

4. **Generalization to Other Models:**
   The paper focuses on SNNs; however, discussing how the concepts presented could be generalized or applied to other neural architectures, particularly continuous models like traditional ANNs, would add more significance to the research.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, "Threaten Spiking Neural Networks Through Combining Rate and Temporal Information" presents a significant and innovative contribution to the field of adversarial machine learning and spiking neural networks. The proposed HART method is theoretically grounded and demonstrates excellent performance in experiments. Addressing the noted weaknesses would contribute to the work’s impact and applicability. I recommend the paper for acceptance at ICLR 2024, as it advances our understanding of vulnerabilities in spiking neural networks and opens avenues for further research on enhancing the robustness of such models.
