### Review of "APOLLO: Zero-Shot Multi-Modal Reasoning with Multiple Experts"

#### Summary
The submitted paper presents **APOLLO**, a novel framework for zero-shot multi-modal reasoning that leverages multiple pre-trained foundation models across different modalities (text, image, audio) without the need for prompt engineering or task-specific training. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through two primary applications: stylized image captioning and a novel task called audio-aware image captioning. The proposed method apparently outperforms existing semi-supervised approaches and shows promise in generating captions that incorporate both style and contextual audio information.

#### Strengths
1. **Innovative Framework**: APOLLO introduces a decentralized approach that allows different foundation models to collaborate and share expertise without relying on prompts, which could enhance flexibility and extendibility in multi-modal tasks.

2. **Performance Results**: The authors provide substantial empirical evidence showing that their method outperforms existing techniques, particularly in terms of style accuracy and text-image correspondence. The reported improvements in state-of-the-art metrics add credibility to the framework’s effectiveness.

3. **Generalization Across Modalities**: Demonstrating the adaptability of the framework by introducing audio-aware captioning illustrates its capability to handle emerging tasks in the multi-modal domain, which is a significant contribution to the field.

4. **Comprehensive Experiments and Evaluation**: The paper presents thorough experimental setups, explanations of methodology, and detailed discussions of results, providing a well-rounded view of how APOLLO works and its advantages.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is dense and at times convoluted in its explanations, especially in sections detailing the loss functions and optimization steps. Clearer visual aids, such as flowcharts or diagrams, could enhance reader understanding of the more complex concepts.

2. **Limitations of the Approach**: While the paper mentions the framework's zero-shot capability, it would benefit from a more in-depth discussion regarding potential limitations or scenarios where the approach may not perform optimally. For instance, how does APOLLO handle noisy or ambiguous multi-modal inputs compared to supervised methods?

3. **Comparison with Baselines**: The paper primarily focuses on comparing APOLLO with semi-supervised state-of-the-art models. It would be useful to see a broader comparison including more recent zero-shot models or frameworks to provide context on where APOLLO stands relative to the entire spectrum of solutions.

4. **Reproducibility**: Although hyperparameters are mentioned, they could be presented more clearly and organized, possibly in a dedicated section or table. A more detailed description of the implementation would facilitate reproducibility and allow other researchers to validate the findings more effectively.

5. **Qualitative Analysis**: While the paper includes qualitative examples of generated captions, an analysis of why certain prompts or styles may yield suboptimal results for APOLLO compared to traditional models would enrich the discussion and provide further insights into the system’s capabilities and limitations.

#### Additional Comments
- **References**: The references are comprehensive and relevant, establishing a robust context for the work presented. However, in-text citations could be better integrated to provide smoother transitions between related works and support statements made throughout the paper.

- **Future Work**: A discussion on potential directions for future research could benefit readers, especially regarding how the framework might be extended to include more modalities or incorporate user feedback in real-time applications.

### Conclusion
Overall, this paper presents a compelling framework that addresses multi-modal reasoning challenges effectively while achieving notable performance gains. With some improvements in clarity, depth of discussion regarding limitations, and reproducibility aspects, it could cater well to the field's needs and attract interest at ICLR 2024.
