**Review of "ZeroFlow: Scalable Scene Flow via Distillation"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents "ZeroFlow," a novel approach to scene flow estimation that utilizes a distillation framework called Scene Flow via Distillation (SFvD). The authors aim to combine the advantages of both test-time optimization methods and supervised feedforward methods, achieving a scalable and efficient solution for estimating 3D motion fields in point clouds. Importantly, ZeroFlow operates without requiring human annotations, relying instead on pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. The authors demonstrate that their method outperforms existing techniques regarding both speed and performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Argoverse 2 Self-Supervised Scene Flow Challenge.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach:** The proposed distillation framework is a significant contribution to the field of scene flow estimation. By leveraging label-free pseudo-labeling, the authors effectively address the bottleneck of human annotation costs and train on large unlabeled datasets.
  
2. **Performance Gains:** The experimental results convincingly illustrate that ZeroFlow achieves competitive performance against existing state-of-the-art methods. The authors show that their method is over 1000× faster than traditional optimization-based methods, making it applicable for real-time systems.
  
3. **Release of Resources:** The authors provide their code, trained model weights, and high-quality pseudo-labels for popular datasets like Argoverse 2 and Waymo Open. Such transparency will facilitate further research and development within the community.

4. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper engages in thorough evaluation, comparing the performance of ZeroFlow against various baseline methods and discussing scaling laws, dataset diversity, and the impact of teacher quality on performance.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Generalization Beyond Datasets:** While the performance on Argoverse 2 and Waymo Open is impressive, the paper does not offer extensive analysis on how well ZeroFlow generalizes to datasets other than these two. Evaluating on a broader range of datasets would strengthen the claim of scalability and robustness.

2. **Potential Limitations of Pseudo-labels:** The authors acknowledge that ZeroFlow inherits the biases of its pseudo-labels. While they highlight the potential challenges, there is limited discussion around strategies to mitigate or validate these biases. Further exploration of this issue could enhance the robustness of their framework.

3. **Complexity of the Framework:** The SFvD framework, while conceptually appealing, may present challenges in implementation complexity. Some readers may benefit from more detailed documentation of the framework’s components and their interactions.

4. **Comparative Analyses:** The comparisons with existing methods focus largely on raw performance metrics. A deeper investigation into how ZeroFlow differs in qualitative performance or error distribution could provide greater insights into its practical applications.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, "ZeroFlow: Scalable Scene Flow via Distillation" makes a significant contribution to the field of scene flow estimation by presenting a scalable, label-free methodology that balances efficiency and accuracy. The combination of distillation techniques and a novel approach to pseudo-label generation holds promise for future developments in real-time computer vision applications. However, the paper would benefit from broader evaluations to establish generalizability, explore biases more comprehensively, and provide more in-depth analyses of model behaviors. As it stands, the paper offers valuable insights and sets a strong foundation for further advancements in scene flow estimation. I recommend acceptance for presentation at ICLR 2024, with minor revisions.
