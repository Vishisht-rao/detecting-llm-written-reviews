**Review of the Paper "Optimal Action Abstraction for Imperfect Information Extensive-Form Games"**

**Overall Impression:**

The paper proposes a novel framework called RL-CFR for solving large-scale Imperfect Information Extensive-Form Games (IIEFGs) by combining reinforcement learning (RL) with counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) to dynamically select action abstractions. The proposed approach addresses a critical gap in the current methodologies for handling IIEFGs, particularly in optimizing action abstraction strategies for reducing computational complexity while enhancing performance. The experimental results presented in the paper demonstrate improvements over existing state-of-the-art techniques, specifically in the context of Heads-up No-Limit Texas Hold'em (HUNL).

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Contribution:** 
   - The introduction of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation that utilizes public information as states and feature vectors of action abstractions as actions is innovative. This dynamic approach contrasts with the existing fixed-action methods, which can lead to sub-optimal strategies.
   - The two-phase RL-CFR framework ingeniously combines the strengths of RL with CFR to enable dynamic action abstraction, which is a significant advancement in this field.

2. **Experimental Validation:** 
   - The paper provides extensive experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of RL-CFR, including win-rate comparisons against ReBeL’s replication and a competitive AI, Slumbot. The statistically significant win-rate improvements highlight the practical applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.

3. **Clarity and Structure:** 
   - The paper is well-structured and thorough, presenting background information, methodology, experiments, and results in a coherent manner. The use of detailed examples, particularly in the experimental section, aids in understanding the proposed framework's functionality.

4. **Relevance to the Field:**
   - The results contribute to the ongoing research in AI and game theory by offering a more efficient approach to solving IIEFGs, which are prevalent in various multi-agent systems.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Theoretical Guarantees:** 
   - The paper lacks a theoretical guarantee for the convergence and optimality of the RL-CFR method compared to fixed action abstraction methods. While empirical results are favorable, the absence of theoretical underpinning may raise concerns, especially among researchers focused on foundational guarantees in learning algorithms.

2. **Implementation Complexity:**
   - The RL-CFR framework may introduce additional complexity in implementation, given the requirement of combining RL and CFR techniques. It would benefit from a discussion on the trade-offs involved in this complexity, particularly in practical applications.

3. **Generalizability:**
   - While the focus on HUNL is appropriate and well-justified, additional experimentation across a broader range of IIEFGs would strengthen the argument for the method’s generalizability. This would provide insights into whether the observed improvements are consistent across diverse scenarios.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Theoretical Analysis:** 
   - Enhance the paper by providing a theoretical analysis or discussion on the convergence properties and potential optimality of the RL-CFR framework. Addressing this aspect could significantly bolster the credibility of the proposed method.

2. **Evaluation Metrics:** 
   - Consider incorporating additional evaluation metrics beyond win-rate to assess the robustness and efficiency of the RL-CFR method, such as computational time, the number of iterations for convergence, or exploitability measures.

3. **Broader Benchmarking:** 
   - Expanding experimental results to include various types of IIEFGs would help to establish the versatility of the proposed framework and validate its effectiveness across different game formats.

**Conclusion:**

In summary, the paper presents a significant advancement in the field of AI and game theory by introducing the RL-CFR framework for solving IIEFGs. The combination of RL and CFR to dynamically select action abstractions is innovative and has shown promising results. While there are some areas for improvement, particularly in terms of theoretical analysis and broader benchmarking, the contributions of the paper are commendable, and it is likely to stimulate further research in the area of action abstraction in games. Overall, I recommend this paper for acceptance with minor revisions.
