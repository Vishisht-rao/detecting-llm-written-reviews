### Review of "PROMPT TUNING IS ALL WE NEED?"

#### Summary
The paper investigates the efficacy of prompt tuning in the context of domain generalization (DG) using CLIP-based vision-language models. The authors assert that previous strategies centered around tuning prompts may not substantially improve generalization performance and propose an alternative approach named Im-Tuning, which involves tuning image encoder parameters to enhance feature separability. They conduct extensive experiments on various DG benchmarks and argue that their method outperforms existing state-of-the-art models.

#### Strengths

1. **Novelty of Approach**: The introduction of Im-Tuning challenges the prevailing belief in the sufficiency of prompt tuning for improving domain generalization. By focusing on the image encoder's parameters, the authors provide a fresh perspective on optimizing the model's performance, which is significant in the evolving field of vision-language models.

2. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The paper presents a thorough evaluation of Im-Tuning against multiple established datasets and models. The experimental design appears robust, covering a variety of scenarios including few-shot learning, cross-dataset transfer, and generalization from base to novel classes. The use of multiple performance metrics and settings strengthens the validity of the findings.

3. **Insightful Findings**: The authors provide interesting insights into the limitations of prompt tuning, claiming that merely optimizing prompts does not lead to significant performance improvements due to the inseparability of image features. This insight underscores the need for alternative strategies to achieve better domain generalization outcomes.

4. **Clear Presentation**: The structure of the paper is coherent, with clear sections outlining the introduction, methodology, experiments, and results. Figures and tables supporting the text are well-presented, aiding in the comprehension of the method and its results.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Limited Discussion on Limitations and Interpretability**: While the authors briefly mention that the method lacks interpretability and is sensitive to noisy labels, a more profound exploration of these limitations would enhance the paper. It would be beneficial to discuss specific scenarios where Im-Tuning may underperform or lead to adverse effects.

2. **Lack of Theoretical Basis**: The proposed method could benefit from a stronger theoretical foundation to support the claims made about feature separability and the predicted benefits of tuning the image encoder. Without a solid theoretical underpinning, the findings, although empirically supported, might appear less compelling to some readers.

3. **Comparative Depth**: While the paper compares Im-Tuning to several existing methods, a more in-depth analysis of why those methods might fail and how Im-Tuning addresses those issues would add clarity to the arguments. Detailed qualitative insights into the performance differences across methods might also enhance the discussion.

4. **Ethics and Reproducibility**: The ethical statement and reproducibility section are brief; while the authors claim no ethical concerns, it would be advantageous if they could provide more detailed considerations of the broader implications of applying their method in real-world scenarios. Further information on replication and ease of access to resources would also be valuable for the community.

#### Conclusion
The paper presents a thought-provoking examination of prompt tuning and introduces a novel approach that potentially offers significant improvements in domain generalization for vision-language models. Despite some weaknesses in depth of analysis and theoretical justification, the empirical results are compelling. Overall, this contribution is likely to spur further research into enhancing model adaptability and robustness across various domains, making it a valuable submission for ICLR 2024.
