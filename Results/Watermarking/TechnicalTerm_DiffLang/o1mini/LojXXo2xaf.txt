**Review of "GPT Can Solve Mathematical Problems Without a Calculator"**

### Summary
The paper presents a new language model, MathGLM, which is reported to perform multi-digit arithmetic operations with high accuracy, surpassing the performance of existing models like GPT-4. The authors argue against the prevailing assumption that large language models struggle with complex arithmetic tasks without the aid of calculators. They claim that their model can achieve high accuracy in both basic arithmetic and math word problems, utilizing a step-by-step strategy and curriculum learning to enhance its problem-solving capabilities.

### Strengths
1. **Innovative Approach**: The proposed use of a step-by-step strategy for solving arithmetic problems is a novel approach that mirrors human problem-solving processes. This design is well-conceived and supports the main goal of demonstrating enhanced arithmetic abilities.
  
2. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The authors provide extensive experimental results comparing MathGLM's performance against several prominent LLMs, including both arithmetic tasks and math word problems. Their thorough evaluation seems robust and effectively showcases the advantages of their model.

3. **High Accuracy Claims**: The paper presents impressive accuracy metrics for MathGLM, especially in multi-digit arithmetic tasks and in the context of math word problems, specifically indicating significant improvements over models like GPT-4 and ChatGPT.

4. **Detailed Methodology**: The methodology section is well-explained, providing clarity around the training and evaluation processes, dataset construction, model architecture, and training parameters, which aids reproducibility.

### Weaknesses
1. **Overemphasis on Limitations of Existing Models**: While the authors effectively illustrate MathGLM's capabilities, the discussion tends to downplay the context in which models like GPT-4 are evaluated. A more nuanced comparison that includes specifics on why those models struggle could strengthen the claims made in favor of MathGLM.

2. **Lack of Discussion on Limitations**: Although the paper discusses various metrics and results, it lacks a section dedicated to the limitations of MathGLM. Understanding the situations in which it may still falter (e.g., extreme edge cases) is critical for assessing its potential real-world applications.

3. **Generalizability**: Given that the paper is primarily focused on multi-digit arithmetic and math word problems from a particular dataset, questions remain regarding the generalizability of the findings. Further validation using varied datasets outside of those used in training would strengthen the conclusions.

4. **Error Analysis**: While the paper touches on some errors made by MathGLM, providing a more in-depth error analysis could be beneficial. Specifically, employing specific examples or categorizing types of errors could shed light on the model's weaknesses and areas for improvement.

### Recommendations
- **Expand Error Discussion**: Adding a section or more detailed analysis on failure cases could provide readers with a clearer understanding of the limitations and potential improvements for the MathGLM model.
  
- **Broader Dataset Validation**: Encouraging subsequent work to evaluate MathGLM across a wider range of tasks and datasets would help validate its performance claims further.
  
- **Contextual Comparison**: Include more comprehensive context regarding the limitations of competing models, addressing not only their arithmetic shortcomings but also their strengths in other domains to provide a balanced perspective.

### Conclusion
Overall, this study introduces an innovative language model capable of solving complex arithmetic tasks more effectively than prior models. With substantial empirical support, the authors present a compelling case for MathGLM’s capabilities. However, the paper could be strengthened by addressing its limitations and expanding upon its error analysis. This would bolster the credibility of its findings and encourage further research into the application of language models in mathematical problem-solving.
