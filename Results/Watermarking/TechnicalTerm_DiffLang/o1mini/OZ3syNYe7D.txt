**Review of PEAR: Primitive Enabled Adaptive Relabeling for Boosting Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning**

### Summary
The paper presents a novel approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) called Primitive Enabled Adaptive Relabeling (PEAR). The proposed method addresses key challenges in HRL, specifically the issues of non-stationarity and subgoal generation during long-horizon tasks. PEAR incorporates adaptive relabeling based on expert demonstrations to create an efficient subgoal supervision framework, leveraging techniques from both reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL). The authors provide theoretical analysis to justify the benefits of their approach and demonstrate its effectiveness on various challenging robotic environments.

### Strengths
1. **Innovative Methodology**: PEAR introduces a compelling two-phase approach that combines adaptive relabeling with joint optimization of hierarchical policies. This represents a thoughtful approach to mitigate non-stationarity, a well-known challenge in HRL.
  
2. **Theoretical Contribution**: The theoretical bounds presented for the sub-optimality of the proposed approach enhance the rigor of the work. This kind of analytical insight is appreciated and provides a strong foundation for understanding the claimed improvements.

3. **Extensive Experiments**: The paper conducts thorough experiments across multiple complex environments (e.g., maze navigation, pick and place) and compares PEAR against various state-of-the-art baselines. The study clearly demonstrates that PEAR outperforms these baselines in terms of success rates and sample efficiency.

4. **Real-World Applicability**: The inclusion of real-world robotic experiments adds significant value to the paper, showcasing the practical applicability of the proposed method and its robustness beyond simulated tasks.

5. **Comprehensive Ablation Studies**: The authors conduct several ablation studies to test different components and hyperparameters of the approach, providing clarity on specific design choices that contribute to performance.

### Weaknesses
1. **Limitations in Expert Demonstrations**: The reliance on directed expert demonstrations may limit the approach's applicability in real-world scenarios where such directed data may not be readily available. Discussing potential strategies to address this limitation would strengthen the paper.

2. **Complexity of Implementation**: While the theoretical framework is sound, the implementation of the proposed method (specifically, maintaining and updating adaptive relabeling mechanisms) may introduce additional complexity that could hinder usability. Providing pseudocode or clearer implementation guidelines could improve accessibility for practitioners.

3. **Scalability Considerations**: The scalability of PEAR to larger or more diverse environments with higher dimensional state-action spaces is not addressed in detail. Insights into how the method might adapt or scale would be beneficial for potential users.

4. **Discussion of Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: While the paper presents multiple experiments evaluating hyperparameter effects, a more in-depth discussion around the sensitivity and tuning of these parameters may guide future researchers.

5. **Clarification on Curriculum Learning**: The paper suggests that PEAR generates a curriculum of efficiently achievable subgoals for the lower primitive. However, the explicit mechanism behind this curriculum generation could benefit from further clarification, particularly in how it adapts over the course of training.

### Overall Evaluation
The paper makes a substantial contribution to the field of hierarchical reinforcement learning by presenting an innovative method that effectively addresses critical issues associated with long-horizon tasks. Theoretical backing, extensive experimentation, and real-world applicability collectively strengthen the case for PEAR as a viable addition to the HRL toolkit.

However, attention to the limitations described above and providing clearer guidelines for implementation and scalability would enhance the work's impact and usability. I recommend accepting the paper with minor revisions to address these concerns.

### Suggested Rating: 8.5/10

### Recommendation: Accept with Minor Revisions

This paper holds potential for significant impact in the space of HRL, and with some adjustments, it could offer strong foundations for future developments in adaptive learning strategies.
