**Review of "SPARSE BACKPROPAGATION FOR MOE TRAINING"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents an innovative method called SparseMixer, aimed at improving the training efficiency of Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) models by providing a scalable gradient estimation strategy that overcomes the challenges posed by sparse expert routing. The authors highlight that while MoE models enhance computational efficiency, they suffer from difficulties during backpropagation due to the discrete nature of expert routing, which leads to non-differentiable outputs. SparseMixer introduces a numerical ordinary differential equations (ODE) framework, specifically utilizing the mid-point method, to facilitate accurate gradient approximations without incurring a significant computational overhead.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The paper tackles a significant problem in the training of MoE models by proposing a new gradient estimation technique that is both efficient and accurate. The proposal sits at the intersection of theoretical advancements in numerical methods and practical implementations in deep learning, which is pertinent given the rapid scaling of neural networks.
   
2. **Robust Experimental Validation**: The authors provide comprehensive experimental results across two tasks—pre-training and neural machine translation—showing that SparseMixer not only accelerates convergence but also improves overall performance of MoE models compared to traditional methods.

3. **Theoretical Foundation**: The methodological grounding in numerical analysis through the use of ODEs and the mid-point method enhances the paper’s credibility. The comparisons made with existing methods (e.g., Straight-Through estimators and REINFORCE) also help to contextualize the contributions made by SparseMixer.

4. **Clarity and Structure**: The manuscript is generally well-structured and clearly written, guiding the reader through complex ideas and results effectively. The logical flow from theory to experiments facilitates comprehension even for readers less familiar with MoE models.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Analytical Depth**: While the introduction provides a broad overview of the gap in the literature, a more detailed discussion on existing gradient estimation methods could enhance the understanding of why SparseMixer presents a better alternative in certain contexts. 

2. **Scaling Considerations**: Although the authors mention negligible computational overhead, a more rigorous analysis comparing computational costs across varying numbers of experts in practical scenarios would strengthen the argument. How does SparseMixer perform as the model scales to extremely large settings, and are there diminishing returns at higher complexities?

3. **Generalization Beyond Switch Transformer**: The experiments primarily focus on the Switch Transformer. The authors should address the applicability of SparseMixer across other architectures and its potential limitations. Establishing generalizability would elevate the significance of the proposed method.

4. **Discussion on Limitations**: Although the authors emphasize performance improvements with SparseMixer, remnants of overfitting in the MoE models should be discussed in more depth. A thorough exploration of the implications of the findings, including any biases introduced by model design or training strategy, would provide a more nuanced understanding of the results.

**Additional Comments:**
- Figures and tables are adequately presented and effectively summarise results.
- The supplementary materials contain essential implementation details that engage with reproducibility—a critical factor in contemporary AI research.
- Future work directions could be highlighted, potentially including hybrid models or addressing other training challenges associated with MoE models.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, "Sparse Backpropagation for MoE Training" presents a valuable contribution to the field of deep learning, particularly in the training of large-scale models. SparseMixer has the potential to become an essential tool for practitioners working with MoE architectures. However, addressing the above weaknesses regarding depth of analysis and generalizability would significantly enhance the manuscript. I recommend acceptance after revisions.
