**Review of A-LOC: Efficient Alternating Iterative Methods for Locating the k-Largest/Smallest Elements in a Factorized Tensor**

**General Overview:**
The paper presents a novel approach for efficiently locating the largest and smallest elements in a factorized tensor, addressing a crucial problem in high-dimensional data analysis. The authors introduce a continuous optimization model and an alternating iterative method, enhanced by the Maximum Block Improvement (MBI) approach and a novel block-search strategy. The empirical results suggest significant improvements in performance metrics, including accuracy and efficiency, when compared to existing methods.

**Strengths:**

1. **Relevance and Motivation:** The problem of locating significant elements in high-dimensional tensor data is of great importance in various applications, including recommendation systems and quantum simulations. By targeting this problem, the paper addresses a critical need in the field.

2. **Innovative Approach:** The combination of a continuous optimization framework with the MBI strategy is a novel contribution that improves convergence and accuracy. The developed methods are articulated clearly, with a detailed theoretical foundation provided, including convergence analysis.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The experimental section is thorough, presenting results from synthetic tensors, tensors derived from multivariate functions, and real-world datasets. The benchmarks against established methods (such as power iteration and star sampling) lend credence to the claims of improved performance.

4. **Clarity of Presentation:** The structure of the paper is logical, progressing from theoretical foundations to the proposed algorithms and then to experimental results. The graphical illustrations aid in understanding the algorithms' workings.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Theoretical Depth:** While the authors provide convergence analysis for their methods, further exploration of the optimality conditions and an analysis of the sensitivity to initialization could strengthen the theoretical framework. Additionally, a more detailed discussion on the implications of the convergence speed would be beneficial.

2. **Complexity Analysis:** Although the paper discusses computational complexity, a more rigorous analysis regarding the trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency would help readers understand the scalability of the proposed methods, especially in large-scale applications.

3. **Discussion on Limitations:** The paper makes claims about notable performance improvements over other methods, but a discussion on the limitations of the proposed approach—such as situations where the algorithms may fail or underperform—would provide a more balanced view.

4. **Block-Search Strategy Analysis:** The implementation of the block-search strategy is an interesting addition; however, its complexity and the significance of the choice of block size (b) should be discussed in greater detail. Understanding how different block sizes impact performance and the threshold beyond which performance gains diminish would be informative for practitioners.

5. **Future Work:** The authors mention future works will include exploring the convergence speed and extending the optimization framework to other tensor formats. More explicit future research directions could enrich the concluding section, highlighting the broader impact of their findings.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a compelling and significant contribution to the field of tensor decomposition and optimization. The integration of a continuous optimization model with an innovative iterative algorithm shows promise. While the paper is well-written and contributes valuable insights, addressing the mentioned areas for improvement could further enhance its impact and clarity. I recommend acceptance with revisions that strengthen the theoretical foundation and discussion sections.
