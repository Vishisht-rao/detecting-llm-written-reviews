**Review of "Continual Learning in Open-Vocabulary Classification with Complementary Memory Systems"**

**Summary:**
The authors present a novel approach for continual learning in the domain of open-vocabulary image classification, drawing parallels with human cognitive processes, particularly the concept of complementary learning systems. Their proposed method combines a zero-shot CLIP model with an exemplar-based model through a unique mechanism termed "tree probe." This method aims to enable efficient incremental learning while maintaining flexible inference capabilities. The authors rigorously evaluate their approach in various learning scenarios (data incremental, class incremental, and task incremental settings) and demonstrate promising results compared to existing techniques.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Framework**: The integration of a zero-shot model with an exemplar-based approach is well-motivated and leverages the strengths of each system effectively. This dual mechanism shows a clear understanding of the challenges present in continual learning and open-vocabulary settings.
  
2. **Robust Evaluation**: The authors conduct thorough experiments across multiple datasets and different learning scenarios. This comprehensive approach adds credibility to their findings and provides a detailed analysis of their model's performance across various conditions.

3. **Adaptive Instance Marginalization (AIM)**: The AIM mechanism presents an interesting approach to adaptively weigh the contributions of the zero-shot and exemplar models, which helps improve prediction accuracy in scenarios with varying label sets.

4. **Practical Applications**: The proposed quick learning method ("tree probe") demonstrates potential applicability in real-time systems, such as interactive learning models or online classification tasks, which is an important aspect in the deployment of machine learning systems.

5. **Solid Theoretical Basis**: The paper is grounded in cognitive science literature, providing a rich theoretical framework that supports the proposed methods. The references to the complementary learning systems observed in human cognition add depth to the motivation of the study.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Implementation Specifics**: While the paper discusses the advantages of tree probe, it would benefit from more detail on the implementation complexity and the computational resources required, particularly in a practical deployment scenario. The trade-offs between model size, inference time, and accuracy could be more clearly articulated.

2. **Limitations and Future Work**: The authors briefly mention limitations in terms of memory constraints and the lack of exploration into improving the zero-shot model. However, they could expand on potential solutions or methods to overcome these barriers, providing a clearer sense of the next steps for this research domain.

3. **Performance Abstraction**: Tables summarizing results such as accuracy metrics for each configuration could be clearer if accompanied by more detailed statistics, such as standard deviations or confidence intervals, which would provide deeper insight into the stability and robustness of the results. 

4. **Literature Contextualization**: While the authors do a commendable job referencing related works, a more nuanced discussion on the position of their method relative to the latest advancements in continual learning, particularly in the context of long-tailed or imbalanced datasets, could further strengthen the context of their work.

5. **Redundant Sections**: Some parts of the paper contain repetitive explanations about the aims and motivations of the research. Streamlining these sections could enhance the overall clarity and flow of the manuscript.

**Conclusion:**
The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of continual learning and image classification through its innovative combination of models and rigorous evaluation. Despite some areas for improvement, such as implementation specifics and deeper exploration of its limitations and future applications, the work is well-articulated and provides a promising avenue for further research. The findings and methods presented could potentially lead to more flexible and responsive machine learning systems, aligning well with current trends in the AI community. Overall, I recommend the paper for acceptance, with suggestions for addressing the noted weaknesses during the revision phase.
