### Review of "ON STATIONARY POINT CONVERGENCE OF PPO-C LIP"

#### Summary
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the Proximal Policy Optimization with a Clipped Surrogate Objective (PPO-Clip) variant, a popular algorithm in reinforcement learning (RL). The authors provide comprehensive results demonstrating the stationary point convergence of PPO-Clip and the associated convergence rates, addressing gaps in the current theoretical understanding of the algorithm. This analysis accounts for the unique challenges presented by the non-smooth clipping operator, the ratio of two stochastic policies, and other complexities inherent in PPO-Clip.

#### Strengths
1. **Relevance and Timeliness**: The research is impactful, given the widespread use and empirical success of PPO in RL applications. Understanding the theoretical foundations of PPO-Clip is crucial for both researchers and practitioners.

2. **Comprehensive Analysis**: The authors tackle various challenges associated with the theoretical analysis of PPO-Clip, including the clipped objective's non-smooth nature and the stochastic policy ratios. They cleverly devise a two-scale iterative process to facilitate their analysis, which contributes to a significant advancement in the understanding of this algorithm.

3. **Essential Contributions**: The paper introduces a key lemma that elucidates the recursive properties of PPO-Clip's optimization process. This lemma may have broader implications beyond PPO and could be beneficial for analyzing other optimization algorithms in similar settings.

4. **Well-Structured Presentation**: The paper is well-organized, with clear sections that lead the reader through the motivation, methodology, and results logically. The hypotheses and theorems are articulated clearly, making it accessible to readers with a solid grounding in RL.

5. **Experimental Validation**: While the primary focus is on theoretical contributions, the practical implications of this work, particularly in relation to bias in estimations using Monte Carlo methods, are highlighted effectively.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Limited Empirical Analysis**: The paper predominantly focuses on theoretical results without a significant empirical component to back claims. Incorporating experiments that illustrate the convergence properties of PPO-Clip in various environments would strengthen the argument and provide practical context to the theoretical findings.

2. **Technical Complexity**: While the analysis is thorough, parts of the mathematical proofs might be excessively complex for some readers. More intuitive explanations or visual aids could help in comprehensively conveying intricate aspects of the proofs.

3. **Assumptions**: The paper makes various assumptions regarding policy parameterization and learning rates, which, though standard, could be discussed in more detail. A more extensive exploration of the implications of relaxing these assumptions would contribute to a better understanding of the generalizability of the results.

#### Minor Comments
- The paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion of how the key results compare with existing research on PPO and other policy gradient methods.
- There are some typographical errors (for instance, spacing issues in the email addresses) that should be addressed to enhance the professionalism of the presentation.

#### Conclusion
Overall, this paper represents a valuable contribution to the theoretical understanding of PPO-Clip in reinforcement learning, addressing significant gaps in the literature. The findings have the potential to influence both future theoretical studies and practical implementations in RL. To maximize impact, the authors should consider pairing the theoretical results with empirical validation in future work. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
