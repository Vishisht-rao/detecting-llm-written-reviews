### Reviewer Comments on "Understanding and Mitigating Extrapolation Failures in Physics-Informed Neural Networks"

#### Summary:
The authors present a comprehensive study on the extrapolation behavior of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), revealing critical insights into their performance when predicting beyond the training domain. They challenge the prevailing notion that high-frequency components in solution functions lead to poor extrapolation performance. Instead, they identify and quantify spectral shifts in the Fourier spectrum of the solution as the primary cause of extrapolation failures. The paper also introduces a novel metric, the Weighted Wasserstein-Fourier distance (WWF), for predicting extrapolation performance and proposes a transfer learning strategy to mitigate the effects of spectral shifts, achieving a significant reduction in extrapolation errors.

#### Strengths:
1. **Novel Insights**: The authors provide a fresh perspective by focusing on spectral shifts instead of high frequencies alone as the culprits of extrapolation failures. This is an important shift in understanding PINN behavior.
   
2. **Methodological Rigor**: The analysis is methodologically sound, employing a range of representative PDEs, including high-dimensional ones, and systematically studying the extrapolation behavior under varied conditions.

3. **Introduction of WWF**: The introduction of the Weighted Wasserstein-Fourier distance serves as a valuable tool for quantifying spectral shifts and has potential extensions to other fields where similar challenges exist.

4. **Practical Applications**: The investigation into transfer learning opens avenues for practical applications. The reported reduction in extrapolation errors provides a concrete contribution to the field of scientific machine learning.

5. **Comprehensive Experimental Validation**: The paper includes extensive experiments, demonstrating both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the proposed methods. The results are well-presented with clear illustrations supporting the findings.

#### Weaknesses:
1. **Theoretical Justification**: While the paper highlights empirical results, it lacks a robust theoretical framework to back the insights drawn, particularly concerning the nature of spectral shifts and their implications on PINNs' learning dynamics. A theoretical analysis could enrich the findings and strengthen the overall contribution.

2. **Limited Discussion on Transfer Learning**: Although transfer learning shows promise, the discussion surrounding its effectiveness could delve deeper into the mechanisms that allow for better extrapolation performance when training with related PDEs. Understanding the underlying features that make transfer effective would enhance the practical application of the findings.

3. **Activation Functions**: The paper predominantly examines tanh and sine activations. Exploring a broader range of activation functions, particularly those that are specifically proposed to aid in extrapolation performance, could provide more comprehensive insights.

4. **Mechanisms Behind Extrapolation Errors**: While the paper identifies that the majority of extrapolation errors arise from low-frequency regions rather than high-frequencies, further exploration and explanation of why this occurs would offer valuable insight into the learning dynamics at play in PINNs.

5. **Generalization Beyond Studied PDEs**: The findings are well-supported by the specific PDEs analyzed; however, it is unclear how generalizable these insights are to other types of PDEs or broader classes of problems in scientific computing. Future work should include testing on a wider array of PDEs.

#### Conclusion:
Overall, this paper addresses a significant gap in understanding the extrapolation behavior of PINNs. The contributions are timely and relevant for the field, combining both theoretical insights and practical implications. While the paper is strong in its empirical analysis, enhancing the theoretical underpinnings and expanding the scope of results would greatly improve the impact of the work. Given the importance of accurate extrapolation in scientific computations, the paper is a valuable addition and merits acceptance with revisions. 

**Recommendation**: Accept with minor revisions.
