### Review of the Paper: "How Well Do Supervised 3D Models Transfer to Medical Imaging Tasks?"

**Summary:**
The paper investigates the effectiveness of supervised pre-training on extensive 3D medical imaging datasets and compares its performance against existing pre-training methods in the context of transfer learning. The authors present a novel dataset called AbdomenAtlas 1.1, which consists of 9,262 annotated CT volumes and a suite of models (SuPreM) trained on this dataset. They demonstrate that their approach significantly enhances the transfer learning ability for various medical imaging tasks, specifically 3D image segmentation.

**Strengths:**

1. **Dataset Contribution:** 
   The AbdomenAtlas 1.1 dataset is a substantial contribution to the field of medical imaging. Its volunteer-based annotation involving multiple radiologists addresses the common challenge of acquiring large, high-quality annotated datasets in 3D medical imaging.

2. **Efficient Use of Data and Computation:** 
   The authors convincingly show that the supervised pre-training paradigm allows models to achieve impressive transfer learning capabilities with significantly reduced data and computational resources compared to self-supervised methods. This finding could lead to substantial efficiency gains in medical imaging research where labeled data is scarce.

3. **Robust Experimental Design:** 
   The experiments conducted on various external datasets and tasks provide a thorough evaluation of the transfer performance of SuPreM, confirming its generalizability and effectiveness across different contexts.

4. **Clear Comparisons:** 
   The paper offers a compelling comparison between supervised and self-supervised pre-training paradigms. By systematically varying datasets and computing resources, the authors effectively highlight the advantages of their approach.

5. **Potential for Practical Application:** 
   Given the documented improvements in accuracy for segmentation tasks and the potential for fewer required annotations, this work has practical implications for medical imaging applications where rapid development and deployment of AI models can lead to better patient outcomes.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Comparison with Self-Supervised Approaches:** 
   While the results against self-supervised methods yield significant insights, the scope for comparison could be expanded. Including more recent self-supervised learning techniques could provide a more nuanced understanding of where the proposed approach stands in the broader context of model training strategies.

2. **Interpretability of Results:** 
   The authors briefly mention the interpretability of features learned through supervised pre-training. However, further exploration regarding how these features can be understood in the context of medical imaging (e.g., what specific anatomical traits are captured) would add depth to the discussion.

3. **Generalizability Beyond the Dataset:** 
   The study predominantly focuses on the performance within and across datasets. Including real-world scenarios or clinical settings in future work could help gauge the model's efficacy in less controlled environments.

4. **Lack of Diverse Modalities:** 
   The paper primarily emphasizes CT data. Including results from other imaging modalities (e.g., MRI, PET) could further validate the adaptability and robustness of the proposed pre-training paradigm.

**Conclusion:**
The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of medical imaging by presenting a large, annotated 3D CT dataset and validating the efficacy of supervised pre-training on it. It demonstrates enhanced transfer learning capabilities, thereby affirming the advantages of this approach over traditional self-supervised methodologies. Addressing the mentioned weaknesses in future iterations could further solidify the impact of this research in advancing AI applications in medical image analysis. Overall, this work is poised to facilitate future collaborations and innovations towards improved AI models for medical imaging. 

**Recommendation:** 
Accept with minor revisions, focusing on extending comparisons with self-supervised methods and enhancing the interpretability and generalizability of results.
