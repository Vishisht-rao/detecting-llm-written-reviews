**Review of "Attributed Graph Clustering via Modularity Aided Coarsening"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents an innovative approach to attributed graph clustering that integrates modularity with graph coarsening, alongside several regularization terms. The proposed framework, dubbed Q-FGC, aims to overcome the limitations of existing graph clustering methods, particularly within the context of attributed graphs. The authors also propose methods that integrate their framework with popular Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) such as GCN and VGAE. The paper includes extensive theoretical analysis, convergence proofs, and empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty:**
   - The framework presents a unique combination of modularity maximization and graph coarsening, which is an underexplored area in the field of graph clustering. The introduction of various regularization terms to stabilize the clustering process is a valuable contribution.

2. **Theoretical Rigor:**
   - The authors provide comprehensive theoretical guarantees for their proposed method, including proofs of convexity, convergence, and KKT optimality. This theoretical foundation adds credibility to the claimed efficacy of the proposed framework.

3. **Empirical Validation:**
   - The experiments conducted across diverse datasets show significant improvements in clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. The range of datasets, including both attributed and non-attributed graphs, reflects the versatility of the proposed method.

4. **Integration with GNNs:**
   - The integration of the proposed framework with various GNN architectures is well-explained, and results indicate that this combination enhances performance, making the method practically relevant for real-world scenarios.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Incremental Perception:**
   - While the contribution is indeed novel, certain elements might be perceived as incremental, particularly the addition of a modularity maximization term. An increased emphasis on the unique benefits provided by the integration of these elements into the context of graph clustering would strengthen the argument for its novelty.

2. **Computational Complexity:**
   - The complexity analysis suggests that while the proposed method is faster than traditional GCN-based methods, the worst-case time complexity is still significant. A more in-depth exploration of scalability with real-world large datasets (beyond benchmark datasets) would address potential concerns about usability in practice.

3. **Limitations:**
   - The discussion of limitations regarding situations where the ground truth labeling gives low modularity is somewhat brief. More extensive exploration of the method's performance in these scenarios and any potential adjustments needed could bolster the paper.

4. **Clarity and Readability:**
   - While the theoretical and empirical components are thorough, sections discussing the derivation of certain terms (e.g., Equations 9 and 11) may be complex for readers unfamiliar with the underlying mathematics. Simplifying the presentation or providing additional supplementary material for clarity can enhance accessibility.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper makes commendable strides in the field of attributed graph clustering, presenting a theoretically sound and empirically validated method that has potential practical applications. With minor revisions aimed at enhancing clarity and addressing perceived limitations, this work could contribute significantly to discussions around graph clustering methods in future research. I recommend acceptance for presentation at ICLR 2024, aligning with the conference's focus on innovative techniques in learning from structured data.
