**Review of "BETTER NEURAL PDE SOLVERS THROUGH DATA-FREE MESH MOVERS"**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces a novel neural PDE (partial differential equation) solver named MM-PDE, which leverages a data-free mesh adaptation technique called the Data-free Mesh Mover (DMM). The authors highlight the limitations of existing approaches in dynamic mesh adaptations, primarily focusing on the need for extensive optimal mesh data and the challenges in maintaining the topology during refinement processes. The proposed DMM adapts meshes by efficiently relocating existing nodes rather than adding or removing them, thus allowing for a more adaptive and dynamic representation of PDE solutions while avoiding computational burdens. The paper provides theoretical guarantees regarding mesh interpolation error and demonstrates the effectiveness of the MM-PDE through various empirical experiments.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Contribution**: The introduction of a data-free mesh adaptation technique is a significant contribution to the field. By addressing the challenges of optimal mesh data dependency and topology changes, the paper opens up new pathways for adaptive solutions in dynamic systems.

2. **Theoretical Basis**: The paper includes substantial theoretical analysis to support the claims made about the DMM. The setting of interpolation error bounds through the formulation of monitor functions is a rigorous and commendable undertaking, reinforcing the approach's reliability.

3. **Empirical Validation**: The empirical results presented in the paper effectively demonstrate the advantages of the MM-PDE solver over existing baselines, including traditional methods and existing neural solvers. The use of diverse PDE scenarios, such as the Burgers' equation and flow around a cylinder, emphasizes the generalizability of the proposed method.

4. **Comprehensive Ablation Studies**: The inclusion of comprehensive ablation studies adds depth to the validation process, providing insights into the importance of different components of the proposed architecture and loss functions.

5. **Practical Implications**: Given the problem of mesh adaptation in physical simulations, the proposed method has the potential for significant practical implications across various domains, such as fluid dynamics, weather modeling, and structural mechanics.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity and Clarity**: While the theoretical foundation is robust, some sections of the paper could benefit from clearer explanations. For example, the derivation of the optimal monitor function could be more elaborated for readers less versed in the mathematical intricacies of PDEs and mesh adaptation theory.

2. **Computational Efficiency**: Although the authors mention that the method significantly enhances accuracy, a more detailed analysis of the computational efficiency—especially in terms of training and inference time—compared to existing methods would be beneficial. The stated times in the experiments could be placed in context regarding the scale of the problems being solved.

3. **Generality of Application**: While the experiments address a few PDE scenarios, the extension of the approach to more complex or higher-dimensional PDEs could further strengthen the claims of generality and robustness. Future work could benefit from an exploration of more diverse cases.

4. **Dynamic Adaptation Limitations**: Although adaptive moving meshes are proposed, the potential limitations when faced with highly irregular solution domains or sudden solution changes due to sharp discontinuities could be an important consideration that is not fully addressed.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a significant advancement in the realm of neural solvers for PDEs, with the proposed DMM offering a promising solution to the challenges associated with dynamic mesh adaptation. The balance of theoretical insights and practical performance provides a solid grounding for future explorations and developments in this innovative direction. I recommend acceptance of this paper, considering minor revisions for clarity and additional discussions regarding computational efficiency and broader applicability.
