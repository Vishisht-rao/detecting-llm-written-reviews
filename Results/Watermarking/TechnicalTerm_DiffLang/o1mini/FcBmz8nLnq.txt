**Review of "Finding Adversarially Robust Graph Lottery Tickets"**

**Overview:**
The paper presents a novel method, Adversarially Robust Graph Sparsification (ARGS), aimed at improving the resilience of Graph Lottery Tickets (GLTs) to adversarial attacks on graph neural networks (GNNs). The authors observe that GLTs, which are designed to reduce inference latency and computational requirements, are vulnerable to structure perturbations, leading to significant drops in classification accuracy. The proposed ARGS framework prunes both the graph adjacency matrix and GNN weights by optimizing a new loss function that accounts for graph homophily and uses pseudo-labels for test nodes, positioning itself as an innovative approach to enhancing GNN robustness in adversarial settings.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Contribution:**
   The research addresses a critical gap in understanding GLTs’ robustness against adversarial attacks, a pressing concern given the practical applications of GNNs. By introducing ARGS, which optimizes a loss function tailored for both training and test nodes under adversarial conditions, the paper provides a fresh perspective on enhancing GNNs and contributes valuable insight to the field.

2. **Empirical Validation:**
   The paper provides extensive empirical results across multiple datasets and GNN architectures, demonstrating the effectiveness of ARGS in achieving high sparsity while maintaining or even improving classification accuracy under significant adversarial perturbations. The comparison with established baselines, including UGS and other defense techniques, effectively highlights the advantages of the proposed method.

3. **Clear Methodological Framework:**
   The methodology is well-articulated, with a clear description of how the pruning process is implemented iteratively, as well as the new loss functions designed to facilitate this process. The analysis of the impact of adversarial attacks on graph properties provides a solid theoretical underpinning for the experimental results.

4. **Comprehensive Evaluation:**
   The evaluation includes diverse adversarial attacks (e.g., PGD, MetaAttack, PR-BCD) and testing on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs, which strengthens the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the evaluation against adaptive attacks showcases the robustness of the approach.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity of the Method:**
   While the novel loss function and the ARGS framework are well described, the added complexity may pose implementation challenges for practitioners. More guidance on the practical deployment of the proposed method would be beneficial, particularly regarding the tuning of hyperparameters and training processes.

2. **Limited Discussion on Computational Trade-offs:**
   Although the paper highlights the reduction in MAC operations, more discussion on the computational overhead of the ARGS framework compared to traditional methods would strengthen the understanding of its real-world applicability. Consideration of the trade-off between robustness and model complexity could provide deeper insights into the method's usability.

3. **Experiments on Larger Graphs:**
   The experiments conducted on the OGBN-Products dataset suggest a trend; however, further analysis on how well ARGS scales with increasingly larger and more complex datasets would be insightful. Acknowledging potential limitations in scalability could provide a more nuanced view of the method's applicability.

4. **Ablation Study Clarity:**
   The paper includes an ablation study that effectively elucidates the contributions of different components of the loss function. However, a more structured presentation of the results, perhaps through the use of tables, could improve clarity and allow readers to quickly grasp the implications of each configuration.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of graph neural networks by introducing ARGS, a method that enhances the robustness of GLTs against adversarial attacks. The empirical results strongly support the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and the paper is generally clear and well-structured. Addressing the noted weaknesses, particularly concerning scalability and computational trade-offs, could further enhance the work. Overall, the paper is recommended for acceptance, as it advances our understanding of GNN resilience in adversarial contexts and opens avenues for future research.
