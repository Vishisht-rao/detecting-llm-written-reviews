## Review of "Expressive Losses for Verified Robustness via Convex Combinations"

### Summary

The paper presents a compelling exploration of expressive losses aimed at enhancing the adversarial robustness of neural networks, particularly highlighting the relationship between over-approximation coefficients and performance in verified robustness. The authors propose three novel loss functions—CC-IBP, MTL-IBP, and Exp-IBP—obtained via convex combinations of adversarial attacks and bounds from incomplete verifiers. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that these functions achieve state-of-the-art robustness-accuracy trade-offs across various datasets, maintaining conceptual simplicity while improving upon prior approaches.

### Strengths

1. **Cohesive Framework**: The paper provides a well-structured framework for understanding the trade-offs between adversarial training and verified robustness. The hypothesis surrounding the expressivity of loss functions is original and significantly contributes to the literature on adversarial robustness.

2. **Robust Experimental Evaluation**: The experimental section is thorough, demonstrating strong performance of the proposed methods on multiple benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, TinyImageNet, and downscaled ImageNet. The detailed comparisons with state-of-the-art methods substantiate the claims made regarding the efficacy of the new loss functions.

3. **Comprehensive Analysis**: The authors not only introduce three new loss functions but also offer a detailed analysis of their performance and sensitivity to hyperparameters, particularly the over-approximation coefficient. This depth of examination is crucial for practitioners looking to implement these methods.

4. **Reproducibility**: The authors provide a clear link to the code repository, which enhances reproducibility. They also include pseudo-code alongside detailed hyperparameter settings, making it easier for other researchers to replicate their results.

5. **Addressing Performance Trade-offs**: The discussion on the nuances of achieving reliable robustness-accuracy trade-offs adds valuable insight for future research. The assertion that better approximations of worst-case loss do not always correlate with improved robustness is a significant contribution to the field.

### Weaknesses

1. **Complexity in Notation and Definitions**: While the approach is conceptually sound, some readers may find the notation and definitions slightly convoluted, especially the framing of expressivity and the various combinations employed. A consolidated definition section could aid in clarity.

2. **Dependence on Certain Assumptions**: There are cases where the proposed methods rely heavily on assumptions about the properties of neural networks, such as monotonicity of activation functions. Exploration of robustness under deviations from these assumptions could provide a more holistic understanding.

3. **Limited Discussion on Computational Efficiency**: While the paper covers training and verification performance extensively, a more in-depth analysis of the computational efficiency concerning the novel loss functions compared to traditional methods would enhance the work. Concerns regarding computational overhead or training time are only briefly mentioned.

4. **Ethical Considerations**: Although an ethics statement is present, the discussion surrounding the implications of deploying models with verified robustness could be expanded. An exploration of the ethical landscape, including potential misuse and the model’s societal impacts, would strengthen the paper.

### Conclusion

Overall, the paper is a significant advancement in the pursuit of verified adversarial robustness in neural networks. The introduction of expressive losses through convex combinations provides an innovative method for balancing accuracy and robustness, thereby contributing valuable insights to the machine learning community. The experimental validations reinforce its claims, highlighting its potential for practical applications. Addressing the mentioned weaknesses could further enhance the robustness and applicability of the findings, as well as broaden the discourse on the implications of such advancements in adversarial machine learning. This paper is a solid candidate for acceptance at ICLR 2024. 

**Recommendation**: Accept with minor revisions.
