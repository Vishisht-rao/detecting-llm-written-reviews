OUTPUT:
**Review of "Local-Forward: Towards Biological Plausibility in Deep Reinforcement Learning"**

**Summary:**
The paper proposes Local-Forward, a novel temporal-difference learning algorithm aimed at addressing the biological implausibility of backpropagation in deep reinforcement learning (RL). The authors argue that the traditional backpropagation algorithm contradicts known biological processes in neural networks, particularly in how biological neurons operate. Local-Forward utilizes a local update mechanism that propagates information using forward connections within a recurrent architecture. The authors validate their approach through empirical experiments in the MinAtar environments, demonstrating that Local-Forward can achieve comparable or superior performance to traditional backpropagation methods such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN) in several tasks.

**Strengths:**
1. **Biological Plausibility**: The core argument regarding the limitations of backpropagation in replicating biological learning processes is timely and relevant. The Local-Forward algorithm’s focus on local updates and forward connections represents a significant step towards bridging the gap between artificial intelligence and biological intelligence.

2. **Empirical Validation**: The experimental results presented in the MinAtar environments provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the proposed method. The comparative performance to DQNs also adds credibility to the authors' claims regarding the viability of their approach.

3. **Innovative Architecture**: The introduction of Local-Forward cells, which compute their own local TD error and pass activations forward for subsequent layers, marks an innovative architectural advancement in deep RL.

4. **Clear Structure and Presentation**: The paper is well-structured, providing a logical flow from the introduction through the methodology to empirical validation. The figures and diagrams, particularly in Figure 1 and Figure 2, effectively illustrate key concepts, making them accessible to readers.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Scope of Experiments**: While the authors present convincing results in the MinAtar testbed, the scope of the experiments is somewhat narrow. Additional evaluations in more complex environments or diverse RL settings would strengthen the argument for the general applicability of Local-Forward.

2. **Discussion of Limitations**: Although the authors mention several limitations of their approach, such as the lack of hierarchical predictive coding and the use of an attention mechanism trained via backpropagation, the discussion could be expanded to explore how these limitations might be addressed in future work.

3. **Comparison with State-of-the-Art Algorithms**: While the results are promising against DQNs, a comparison with more advanced and recent algorithms such as Rainbow or MuZero would contextualize the performance claims better. The authors should acknowledge the gap in performance highlighting the need for further development to achieve state-of-the-art results.

4. **Biological Underpinnings**: The paper discusses the biological inspiration behind Local-Forward but could benefit from a more in-depth exploration of how well this approach aligns with current neuroscientific understanding. Specific examples of how biological networks achieve learning would enhance the paper's robustness in this area.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a compelling argument for the Local-Forward algorithm as a biologically plausible alternative to traditional backpropagation methods in reinforcement learning. The innovative contributions to the architecture and the preliminary empirical results are promising, suggesting pathways for future research in bridging AI and neuroscience. Addressing the concerns related to experimental scope and deeper exploration into both the limitations and biological relevance would significantly enhance the impact of this work. I recommend that the paper be accepted for presentation at ICLR 2024 after addressing the aforementioned weaknesses.
