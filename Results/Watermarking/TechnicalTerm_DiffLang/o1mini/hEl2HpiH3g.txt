**Review of "FedJETs: Efficient Just-In-Time Personalization with Federated Mixture of Experts"**

**Overview:**
The paper introduces FedJETs, a novel federated learning (FL) framework utilizing a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm for just-in-time personalization of models in FL setups. The authors propose a mechanism that allows specialized expert models to be selected dynamically based on the characteristics of non-i.i.d. data from clients without requiring additional labeled data for fine-tuning. The method claims to achieve significant improvements in classification accuracy on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 tasks, while maintaining competitive zero-shot performance.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach:** The use of MoEs in FL is not new, but the authors' focus on exploiting the non-i.i.d. nature of client data for model specialization is a noteworthy contribution. The combination of the gating function with a common expert to facilitate expert selection is novel and provides a fresh perspective on model personalization.

2. **Strong Experimental Results:** The experiments demonstrate that FedJETs significantly outperforms traditional methods (FedAvg, FedMix, FedProx, etc.) on both CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets. The claimed up to 18% improvement over state-of-the-art methods in key performance metrics is compelling and provides strong validation for the proposed method.

3. **Clear and Structured Presentation:** The paper is well-organized, with definitions, methodology, and proposed experiments clearly articulated. Figures and tables effectively support the narrative, making it easier for the reader to follow the concepts and results.

4. **Consideration for Resource Constraints:** The focus on reducing communication costs by only sending relevant experts to clients aligns well with the practical considerations in federated learning scenarios, where bandwidth may be limited. 

5. **Potential for Generalization:** The potential to adapt FedJETs to other domains, beyond image classification, suggests broader applications and relevance. This augurs well for future research directions.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity and Scalability:** While the method introduces dynamism in expert selection, the management of multiple expert models and the gating mechanism increases the complexity of the system. The authors could address concerns regarding scalability, particularly with respect to resource-constrained clients or environments where the number of experts is significant.

2. **Empirical Validation:** Although the results are promising, further validation on a broader range of datasets and tasks would strengthen the paper. The authors mention plans for future work but could provide insight into preliminary tests conducted beyond CIFAR datasets to evaluate the robustness and flexibility of FedJETs.

3. **Lack of Theoretical Insights:** While the empirical results are strong, the paper would benefit from a deeper theoretical analysis of why and how the proposed architecture leads to better performance across different data distributions. Elucidating the theoretical foundation could enhance the understanding and appeal to a broader audience.

4. **Client Sampling Strategy:** Although the anchoring of clients is well-motivated, the methodology for selecting anchor clients and their specific impacts on performance (both positive and negative) could be expanded upon. Including a thorough ablation study on how different sampling strategies influence the performance of FedJETs would be beneficial.

5. **Contextual Mapping:** The explicit mention of "contextual mapping," as requested, seems missing. A discussion on how contextual mapping relates to the proposed approach would enhance the paper's depth, especially if this concept plays an integral role in understanding the mechanism of FedJETs.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a significant and relevant advance in the intersection of federated learning and mixture of experts. The proposed FedJETs framework is innovative, effectively tackles practical challenges in model personalization, and demonstrates promising experimental results. Addressing the identified weaknesses, particularly in establishing more robust theoretical foundations and broader empirical validation, could further strengthen the work and its impact in the field. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
