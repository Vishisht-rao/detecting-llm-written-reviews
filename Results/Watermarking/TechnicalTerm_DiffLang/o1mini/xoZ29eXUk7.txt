**Review of "A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework for Evaluating the U.S. ‘Ending the HIV Epidemic’ Plan"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework aimed at optimizing resource allocation for the U.S. "Ending the HIV Epidemic" (EHE) initiative. The authors argue that existing models either focus narrowly on specific jurisdictions or generally on national-level trends, leading to suboptimal policies due to a lack of jurisdictional interactivity. By employing MARL, the authors demonstrate that jurisdiction-specific interventions coupled with cross-jurisdictional interactions can lead to more effective decision-making processes in public health policy regarding HIV prevention and treatment.

**Strengths:**
1. **Relevance and Timeliness:** The EHE initiative has significant implications for public health in the United States. By addressing HIV prevention through a novel MARL approach, this paper contributes meaningfully to research and practice in epidemiology and health policy.
  
2. **Methodological Innovation:** The transition to a MARL framework allows for the consideration of jurisdictional interactions, which is a critical gap in existing literature. The proposed algorithm models each jurisdiction as an independent agent, facilitating nuanced decision-making that aligns with real-world complexities.

3. **Comprehensive Experimental Design:** The authors conduct extensive numerical experiments that effectively validate the advantages of their MARL framework over traditional single-agent approaches (A-SARL) and independent jurisdictional analyses (I-SARL). The results are well-presented and indicate clear performance improvements.

4. **Actionable Insights:** The findings highlight not just theoretical implications but also practical aspects, demonstrating pathways towards achieving EHE goals through increased resource allocation and refined intervention strategies.

**Concern Areas:**
1. **Model Complexity and Interpretability:** While the MARL approach brings forward innovative modeling techniques, it also inherently increases model complexity. The authors could discuss the trade-offs between complexity and interpretability, particularly for public health officials who may not be versed in advanced machine learning techniques. Simplified strategies or decision-support systems based on the model may enhance uptake among practitioners.

2. **Generalizability of Results:** Though the study focuses on jurisdictions in California and Florida, a discussion on how these results may generalize to other regions with different health dynamics, social determinants, and budgets could strengthen the paper. A consideration of the diversity within U.S. jurisdictions in terms of demographics and existing healthcare frameworks might provide a more well-rounded perspective.

3. **Scalability to National-Level Implementation:** While the paper proposes scaling the framework to a national level, the specifics of how this would practically be accomplished remain vague. A more detailed implementation strategy or challenges foreseen in scaling up the application from state to national levels would be beneficial.

4. **Cloud-Edge Model Collaboration Mention:** The reviewer notes a lack of clarity regarding the inclusion of "cloud-edge model collaboration" as mandated by the journal's guidelines. The authors should ensure that this concept is adequately referenced and integrated within the context of the paper.

5. **Future Work and Limitations:** While the current findings are compelling, broader discussions on potential limitations, uncertainties in model assumptions, and directions for future research would strengthen the paper. For example, considerations of data validity, changes in public health policy, and evolving HIV treatment modalities over the time horizon would be valuable.

**Conclusion:**
The paper makes a substantial contribution to the field of public health and epidemiology through the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning. It provides significant insights into how jurisdiction-specific interventions can be optimized based on behavioral interactions between agents. With some revisions to enhance clarity, applicability, and connections to broader concepts, the paper has the potential to offer meaningful advancements in optimizing public health interventions. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
