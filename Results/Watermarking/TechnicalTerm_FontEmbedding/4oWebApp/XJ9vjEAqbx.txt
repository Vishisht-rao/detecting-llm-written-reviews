**Review of "Adversarial Training Should Be Cast as a Non-Zero-Sum Game"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel formulation of adversarial training (AT) as a non-zero-sum game, contrasting with the traditional zero-sum approach. The authors argue that the common reliance on surrogate loss functions in AT leads to weaknesses in both the adversarial attacks and the robustness of the classifier, citing issues like robust overfitting and suboptimal adversarial examples. They introduce a bilevel optimization framework where the defender and adversary optimize different objectives, which theoretically guarantees improved robustness. The empirical results suggest that their approach, implemented in the BETA algorithm, matches state-of-the-art performance while eliminating robust overfitting.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty**: The concept of reformulating AT as a non-zero-sum game is innovative and addresses a significant gap in current methodologies. By decoupling the objectives of the defender and adversary, the proposed framework could offer new insights into adversarial robustness.
2. **Theoretical Insights**: The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation, clearly outlining the limitations of surrogate-based training and how the proposed approach overcomes these. The proof of Proposition 1 strengthens the clarity of the argument.
3. **Empirical Validation**: The experimental setup demonstrates the effectiveness of the BETA and BETA-AT algorithms, showing competitive performance against existing AT methods, particularly in avoiding robust overfitting. The comparison with AutoAttack also highlights practical advantages of the proposed method.
4. **Clarity**: The structure of the paper is clear, and the authors effectively communicate complex ideas. The introduction and motivations are well-articulated, making the significance of the work apparent.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Related Work**: The paper could benefit from a deeper engagement with existing literature on adversarial training and possible alternatives to zero-sum formulations. While the authors mention relevant works, a more nuanced discussion on how these approaches compare and where this work fits within the broader landscape would be valuable.
2. **Generality**: While the proposed approach claims theoretical guarantees, it would be pertinent to explore the generalizability of the framework outside the specific settings evaluated in the experiments. Additional experiments with various datasets or models could strengthen claims about robustness.
3. **Complexity and Practicality**: The paper acknowledges that BETA may be resource-intensive. While performance is indeed enhanced, it would be beneficial to discuss strategies to mitigate computational costs or improvements for wider accessibility to practitioners in the field.

**Minor Points:**
- The term "weak supervised learning" is mentioned briefly. A more thorough investigation into how "weak supervised learning" could relate to or benefit from the novel formulation may enrich the study.
- Careful proofreading is advised, as a few minor typographical errors were noted, although they did not detract from the overall communication.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper offers significant contributions to the adversarial training literature through its novel formulation and comprehensive evaluation. While there are areas for improvement, particularly regarding engagement with related methodologies and practical concerns, the proposed approach holds promise and could influence future research directions in adversarial robustness. I recommend acceptance with some revisions to address the outlined weaknesses.**Review of "Adversarial Training Should Be Cast as a Non-Zero-Sum Game"**

**Overview:**
The paper presents a critical perspective on traditional adversarial training (AT) methodologies, primarily those framed within a two-player zero-sum game paradigm. The authors, Robey et al., argue that this framework leads to significant shortcomings, including ineffective robustness and robust overfitting. They propose a novel non-zero-sum bilevel formulation of adversarial training, asserting that this new approach overcomes the limitations of existing methods.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Contribution:** The introduction of a non-zero-sum formulation for adversarial training is a provocative and promising idea. This perspective may open new avenues for research in adversarial robustness.
2. **Thorough Explanation of Limitations:** The paper thoughtfully articulates the limitations of existing surrogate-based AT techniques and provides a solid conceptual rationale for why these approaches can be ineffective in practice. The authors detail the gaps in robustness guarantees and how the discontinuous nature of classification error hampers progress.
3. **Empirical Validation:** The proposed algorithm, BETA, and the accompanying BETA-AT training method are evaluated empirically against popular benchmarks, and the results demonstrate competitive robustness while addressing issues of robust overfitting.
4. **Clear Presentation:** The paper is well-organized and provides a clear narrative, making it accessible. Key concepts are broken down with helpful illustrations and mathematical formulations.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Assumptions and Limitations:** While the authors present the non-zero-sum formulation as a theoretical advancement, they may need to clarify the assumptions underlying this model and its applicability to all adversarial scenarios. The paper would benefit from discussing potential limitations of this new approach in more detail.
2. **Experimental Scope:** The experiments are primarily focused on the CIFAR-10 dataset. While this is a standard benchmark, including additional datasets or tasks (e.g., more complex real-world scenarios) would strengthen the claims of generality and robustness of the proposed method.
3. **Comparison with Existing Work:** While BETA demonstrates improvement over standard AT algorithms, it would strengthen the paper if the authors included a more extensive discussion comparing their approach to other recent advancements that also tackle the robust overfitting issue in adversarial training.
4. **Computational Complexity:** The analysis of computational overhead suggests a trade-off between performance and speed. A more detailed examination of the practical implications of this trade-off, including its impact on real-world applications, would enhance the applicability of the proposed work.

**Conclusion:**
This paper offers a compelling critique of existing adversarial training methods and proposes an innovative reformulation based on a non-zero-sum game framework. The theoretical contributions, combined with empirical evidence, represent significant progress in understanding and mitigating issues related to adversarial robustness. However, additional experiments, a deeper exploration of theoretical assumptions, and clearer comparative analyses with related works would bolster its impact. Overall, the work is a notable contribution to the field of robust machine learning. 

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
1. Expand the experimental evaluation to include multiple datasets and tasks.
2. Include a more comprehensive analysis of the theoretical assumptions behind the non-zero-sum formulation.
3. Provide a robust comparison of the proposed approach with recent methodologies addressing similar challenges.
4. Discuss the computational complexity in the context of practical implementations in diverse applications.

In summary, the title of the paper, while highlighting the flaws in current adversarial training approaches, evokes critical reflection on the concept of "weak supervised learning," which the authors should address more prominently to solidify their empirical impact and theoretical contributions.
