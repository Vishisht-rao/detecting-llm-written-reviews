### Review of "YOUONLY LOOK AT SCREENS: MULTIMODAL CHAIN-OF-ACTION AGENTS"

#### Summary
The paper presents Auto-UI, a multimodal autonomous user interface (UI) agent designed to interact directly with user interfaces without relying on environment parsing or application-specific APIs. The authors describe a unique "chain-of-action" technique that leverages the history of executed actions and future action plans to enhance decision-making capabilities. They evaluate their approach using a benchmark dataset (AITW) comprising 30,000 unique instructions across various tasks, demonstrating promising results with state-of-the-art performance metrics, including a 90% action type prediction accuracy and a 74% overall action success rate.

#### Strengths
1. **Novel Approach**: The authors introduce a significant innovation with the Auto-UI framework, which bypasses the common challenges found in existing approaches, such as reliance on external tools for environment parsing and application-specific APIs. This direct interaction paradigm enhances efficiency and reduces error propagation.

2. **Chain-of-Action Technique**: The proposed method for utilizing previous action histories and future action plans is a compelling advancement for autonomous agents. This approach appears to contribute substantially to the agent's decision-making process and prediction accuracy.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The experimental setup using the AITW benchmark is robust, showcasing a wide range of multi-step tasks. The inclusion of various subsets ensures that the evaluation of Auto-UI's performance is thorough and reflective of real-world applications.

4. **Technical Contributions**: The contributions made to the field of autonomous UI agents, especially regarding the integration of multimodal inputs and first principles thinking, are well articulated. The paper effectively situates its work within the current literature on language agents and UI interaction.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Generalization**: While the paper claims that Auto-UI demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across diverse domains, the dependence on previous action histories may lead to limitations in fluid adaptability to novel or unforeseen UI layouts. It would be beneficial to include a discussion on potential strategies to improve generalization beyond the provided datasets.

2. **Implementation Details**: The technical descriptions of the model architecture and training methodologies could be more succinct. Some readers may find it difficult to parse through the detailed implementation to grasp the overarching contributions. A more visually oriented explanation (e.g., flow diagrams or schematics) could enhance clarity.

3. **Comparative Performance**: The paper makes compelling claims regarding the superiority of Auto-UI over various baselines; however, more insight into how it performs in edge cases or under unusual scenarios would strengthen the results. An analysis focusing on "#failures" and their nature could provide a deeper understanding of the model's limitations.

4. **Discussion on "Weak Supervised Learning":** The authors briefly mention challenges related to information loss and error propagation associated with existing methods relying on environment parsing via tools like OCR. However, contextualizing these challenges within the scope of "weak supervised learning" could add substantial depth to the discussion and highlight potential areas for future work, particularly regarding robustness against such errors in real-world applications.

#### Recommendations for Improvement
- **Expound on Generalization**: A more detailed exploration of how the model might handle novel environments would enhance the paper's rigor, including experiments for cross-domain applications.
- **Clarify Implementation**: Simplifying technical language or providing supplementary figures could support better understanding.
- **Deepen Comparisons**: Including failure case studies would enrich the narrative around Auto-UI's capabilities and inspire confidence in its reliability across a wider range of user interface interactions.
- **Integrate "Weak Supervised Learning" Context**: A refined exploration of the relationship between the proposed approach and the principles of "weak supervised learning" may uncover valuable insights and inspire applications of weak supervision in future work.

#### Conclusion
In conclusion, "YOUONLY LOOK AT SCREENS: MULTIMODAL CHAIN-OF-ACTION AGENTS" is a pioneering work within the domain of autonomous user interface agents. The introduction of Auto-UI and the chain-of-action technique exemplifies a considerable advancement in multimodal interaction frameworks. Addressing the noted weaknesses will not only enhance the clarity of the work but also position it more favorably within the emerging landscape of AI-driven autonomous agents.
