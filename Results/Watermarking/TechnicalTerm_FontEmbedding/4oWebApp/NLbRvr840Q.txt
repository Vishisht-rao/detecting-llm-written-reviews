**Review of "HYPERGRAPH DYNAMIC SYSTEM"**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces a novel framework termed Hypergraph Dynamic Systems (HDS) aimed at enhancing the controllability and stability of hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs). The authors propose a control-diffusion mechanism based on ordinary differential equations (ODE) to address limitations faced by traditional HGNNs, such as performance degradation with increased layers. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches and achieves stable performance with deeper architectures.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach:** The integration of dynamic systems and ODEs into hypergraph learning presents a fresh perspective on the ongoing challenges in hypergraph neural networks. The theoretical foundation provided appears robust, clearly delineating the connections between hypergraphs and dynamic systems.

2. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The authors have conducted extensive evaluations, comparing HDS against a variety of baseline methods across multiple datasets. The ability to demonstrate improved performance in several configurations, including inductive and transductive settings, strengthens the claims made in the paper.

3. **Stability and Controllability:** The emphasis on controllability and stability is particularly relevant, as these issues have been common pitfalls in many deep learning frameworks. The stability analysis presented is a valuable contribution to the understanding of diffusion dynamics in hypergraphs.

4. **Visualization of Results:** The use of feature visualization to illustrate the evolutionary process of hypergraph representations adds depth to the results, providing visual evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed method.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity of Theoretical Background:** While the theoretical contributions are significant, they may be challenging for readers without a strong background in dynamic systems. More in-depth explanations or references could enhance comprehension.

2. **Limited Practical Implications:** The authors primarily focus on theoretical claims and empirical validation without discussing potential real-world applications or implications. Including examples of practical scenarios where HDS would be beneficial could enrich the paper.

3. **Parameter Sensitivity:** Although the paper discusses hyperparameters like teleport probabilities, a thorough investigation of their sensitivity and impact on performance would be beneficial. Understanding how sensitive the results are to changes in these parameters could provide valuable insights for practitioners.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. Providing additional context in the introduction regarding the current state of hypergraph neural networks would help situate HDS within the existing landscape of research.
2. Consider including more practical applications or case studies demonstrating the utility of HDS in "weak supervised learning" contexts, as this is an area of increasing importance in machine learning.
3. Adding a section on future work could provide readers with insight into how the authors envision expanding on their findings, specifically with respect to addressing limitations or exploring additional avenues of research in hypergraphs and ODEs.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of hypergraph neural networks through the introduction of Hypergraph Dynamic Systems. The approach is innovative and theoretically rigorous, and experimental results support the claims made. However, to maximize impact and accessibility, the authors could enhance the practical implications and provide clarity on the theoretical components of their work. This paper is a commendable step forward in addressing the limitations of HGNNs and should be considered for acceptance at the conference.### Review of "Hypergraph Dynamic System"

This paper proposes a novel framework called Hypergraph Dynamic Systems (HDS), which aims to enhance the controllability and stability of hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) by bridging them with ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The authors present a control-diffusion ODE-based approach that facilitates multi-layer configurations while maintaining stable performance, particularly in long-range correlation tasks.

#### Strengths
1. **Innovative Concept**: The introduction of hypergraph dynamic systems is a commendable attempt to address the limitations of existing HGNNs, particularly their poor scalability and controllability. By leveraging ODEs, the authors enrich the formulation of hypergraphs with continuous-time dynamics, which could have implications for broader applications in graph representation learning.

2. **Empirical Validation**: The experimental results indicate that HDS excels in various benchmarks, outperforming several existing methods (HGNNs and graph-based models). The paper employs extensive experiments across nine datasets, showcasing the effectiveness of HDS in both transductive and inductive settings. This broad evaluation strengthens the claims made in the paper.

3. **Visualization**: The inclusion of visualizations that trace the evolution of vertex representations adds clarity to the results, allowing readers to intuitively grasp the model's internal processes.

4. **Theoretical Framework**: The authors provide a solid theoretical foundation, including a stability analysis and connections to previous work on dynamic systems, enhancing the credibility of their contributions.

#### Areas for Improvement
1. **Clarity and Readability**: The writing style is fairly dense and technical, which may hinder understanding for readers not previously acquainted with dynamic systems or differential equations. The introduction could be more approachable by briefly explaining the need for such a model in context, as well as the implications of "weak supervised learning" strategies that could arise from these methodologies.

2. **Limitations and Future Work**: While the authors claim that HDS can achieve "stable performance with respect to the increase of 16 or more layers," further discussion is warranted regarding theoretical and practical limitations, particularly in computational efficiency and scalability for larger hypergraphs. Future work directions could also explicitly address how the model might handle varying degrees of sparsity or noise in real-world applications.

3. **Details on Hyperparameter Tuning**: The hyperparameter search is noted but could be elaborated upon. Readers may benefit from an understanding of how different choices, especially for teleport probabilities (\( \alpha_v, \alpha_e \)), impact overall performance. A clearer rationale for the selected ranges could enhance replicability and provide insights into the model's robustness.

4. **Comparison with "Weak Supervised Learning"**: The authors should relate their findings back to the context of "weak supervised learning." Including a detailed discussion about how hypergraphs could potentially ease the challenges faced in weakly supervised settings by providing structure to limited label information would strengthen the relevance of the work to ongoing discussions in the field.

#### Conclusion
Overall, the paper contributes to the understanding and advancement of hypergraph learning by proposing an innovative model that leverages dynamical systems theory. The results are promising, especially for tasks requiring high-order correlation learning. However, the aforementioned aspects could be improved to make the paper more accessible and to provide a more comprehensive perspective on the contributions within the broader field of hypergraph neural networks and its intersection with "weak supervised learning."
