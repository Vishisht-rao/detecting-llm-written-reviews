**Review of "One-Shot Empirical Privacy Estimation for Federated Learning"**

**Overview:**
The paper presents a novel technique for estimating the privacy loss in federated learning (FL) systems operating under differential privacy (DP). The authors highlight limitations in existing privacy auditing methods, notably their reliance on strong adversarial assumptions, numerous retraining instances, and task-specific applicability. In contrast, their proposed "one-shot" approach enables privacy estimation during the same training run used to fit model parameters, using random "canary" updates for robust measurements. This work contributes significantly to the fields of privacy and federated learning, addressing practical considerations for deploying privacy estimation at scale.

**Strengths:**
1. **Addressing Practical Challenges:** The method's ability to estimate privacy loss within a single training run appeals to real-world implementations where retraining models repeatedly is impractical due to resource constraints. This is especially important in the realm of federated learning, where training can span days or weeks.
 
2. **Theoretical Grounding:** The authors provide a strong theoretical basis for their approach, offering provably correct estimates under the Gaussian DP mechanism. The analysis regarding the distribution of angles between canary updates and final model outputs is clear and well-supported.

3. **Generalizability:** The proposed technique’s general applicability to various FL tasks and models, without needing prior knowledge of data or architecture, enhances its utility across different applications. This is particularly beneficial in heterogeneous environments often encountered in FL.

4. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The experiments conducted on established benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's robustness and effectiveness. The authors provide insightful comparisons with prior work, including a clear performance distinction under different adversarial assumptions.

5. **Empirical Verification:** The experiment results, particularly on the Stackoverflow and EMNIST datasets, support the theoretical claims, indicating a close alignment between empirical estimates and true privacy loss when varying the noise multipliers and the number of canaries.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Scope of Empirical Validation:** While the authors provide results on Stackoverflow and EMNIST, the generalizability of their findings to other domains (especially those requiring "weak supervised learning") is not explicitly validated. Additional experiments in diverse domains could strengthen claims.

2. **Assumptions and Limitations:** Although the paper discusses assumptions made regarding the adversary’s capabilities, there is minimal exploration of other potential threats or complex scenarios that might undermine the effectiveness of the proposed auditing technique.

3. **Noise Injection Impact:** The approach introduces noise into the training process. While the impact on model accuracy is claimed to be negligible, more thorough quantitative assessments could provide further assurance regarding model performance retention alongside privacy guarantees.

4. **Long-term Utility Examination:** The paper does not discuss how the technique could adapt to evolving adversarial methods or system architectures over time. An adaptive strategy for continuous auditing or retraining might be beneficial for long-lived federated systems.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a compelling contribution to the study of privacy in federated learning settings. The novel "one-shot" approach offers a pragmatic solution to the challenges faced by practitioners in implementing differential privacy in real-world applications. Strengthening the empirical validation and addressing the aforementioned weaknesses could further enhance the impact of this work. I recommend accepting this paper, with minor revisions focused on its limitations and broader applicability.**Review of "ONE-SHOT EMPIRICAL PRIVACY ESTIMATION FOR FEDERATED LEARNING"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel approach for empirically estimating privacy loss in federated learning (FL) systems, specifically under user-level differential privacy constraints. The proposed method offers a "one-shot" solution that enables the auditing of privacy loss during a single training run, addressing the limitations of existing privacy estimation techniques that often require multiple model retrainings and assumptions about adversarial knowledge or model architecture. The authors show that their approach applies to the Gaussian mechanism used in differential privacy and can accurately estimate privacy loss on well-established FL benchmarks with various adversarial threat models.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach**: The introduction of a "one-shot" privacy estimation technique is a significant contribution to the field, overcoming the practical challenges posed by existing methods that require retraining the model multiple times.
  
2. **Implementation and Efficiency**: The proposed method is designed to be low overhead, allowing for estimation without significant performance degradation in the model's accuracy. The use of random canary clients offers flexibility and ease of implementation in real-world federated settings.

3. **Robust Evaluations**: The authors provide thorough empirical evaluations on multiple benchmarks, including the stack overflow word prediction dataset and EMNIST, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach under various noise multipliers and participation constraints.

4. **Deep Connection to Differential Privacy Principles**: By framing their method within the context of differential privacy, the authors provide a strong theoretical foundation for their empirical results, including the potential to recover analytical estimates under high-dimensional settings.

5. **Practical Relevance**: The paper addresses a critical gap in the real-world application of differential privacy in federated learning, making it highly relevant for practitioners and researchers working with sensitive data.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Discussion on Assumptions and Limitations**: While the paper mentions various adversarial models, it could benefit from a more extensive discussion on the assumptions made regarding the adversary's capabilities or the optimal strategies that could counter their approach. For example, specific scenarios where attackers might have additional knowledge or leverage could be explored in more depth.

2. **Generalizability**: The method is proposed as model and dataset agnostic, but further investigation into its performance across a broader range of datasets and model architectures would help validate these claims. The robustness of the approach in less controlled environments could also be examined.

3. **Potential Impact on Model Performance**: Although the paper notes negligible effects on model performance when adding canaries, it would be beneficial to quantify the potential impacts more rigorously, particularly in larger models or more complex datasets.

4. **Empirical Results Interpretation**: The results, while promising, might be interpreted with caution. The experimental setup, particularly concerning noise variance and the metrics used for estimating privacy loss, should ensure they reflect real-world participation and adversarial behavior.

**Additional Considerations:**
- It might be valuable for the authors to address potential uses of their privacy estimation method in conjunction with "weak supervised learning," where labels are derived from less reliable sources or inferred methods. Exploring this connection could open avenues for future research at the intersection of these fields.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper provides a compelling advancement in the field of privacy estimation for federated learning. With some enhancements to clarify assumptions, address limitations, and expand the generalizability of results, it has the potential to significantly impact both theoretical and practical applications in privacy-preserving machine learning. The contribution is timely and relevant, and I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
