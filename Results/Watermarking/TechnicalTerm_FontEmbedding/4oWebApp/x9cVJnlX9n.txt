**Review of "Risk-controlling Model Selection via Guided Bayesian Optimization"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel method for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning models, aimed at balancing conflicting performance metrics while adhering to user-defined risk constraints. The authors combine Bayesian Optimization (BO) with statistical risk control techniques to find Pareto optimal model configurations that also maintain appropriate levels of risk during evaluation. Their approach is particularly relevant in contexts where model deployment must consider trade-offs between accuracy, fairness, robustness, and computational efficiency.

**Strengths:**
1. **Relevant Problem Statement**: The problem of selecting model configurations under multiple constraints is significant in real-world applications, particularly given the increasing demand for models that are not only accurate but also fair and robust. The approach outlined by the authors directly addresses these concerns.

2. **Methodological Innovation**: The introduction of a "region of interest" in the objective space is a thoughtful contribution that appears to enhance the efficiency of both optimization and testing phases. By reducing the search space to a more manageable size, the proposed method likely improves computational efficiency while maintaining statistical validity.

3. **Theoretical Grounding**: The paper builds upon existing works in Bayesian Optimization, statistical testing, and multi-objective optimization. The integration of these methodologies is well articulated, and the formal guarantees provided may prove to be significant contributions to the field.

4. **Empirical Validation**: The authors perform a series of experiments across various tasks, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of their method. The results against several baselines show a clear benefit of their approach, particularly in providing verified control of risk while optimizing performance.

5. **Broad Applicability**: The framework's flexibility to apply across different contexts (e.g., fairness in classification, robustness against spurious correlations, and generative models) suggests that it could be widely relevant across multiple research domains.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Clarity and Complexity**: While the paper delves deep into the theoretical framework and the methodology, some sections may be challenging for the reader to navigate. A clearer explanation of the statistical underpinnings, particularly around the derivation of the region of interest and p-values, could enhance understanding. The complexity of the method may deter practitioners who seek straightforward approaches.

2. **Generalizability of Results**: Although the empirical results are compelling, the experiments are based on a specific set of tasks and datasets. It would be beneficial to see how the proposed method performs in a wider range of scenarios, particularly those that confront different metric types or less structured data environments.

3. **Adaptation to "Weak Supervised Learning"**: The paper does not explicitly address how their approach could be adapted to settings involving "weak supervised learning," where labels may be noisy or incomplete. Given the rise of weak supervision in machine learning, integrating considerations for this paradigm could broaden the applicability of their method.

4. **Computational Overhead**: While the authors argue for improved efficiency through their proposed method, the initial computational burden of generating the initial candidate configurations, especially for complex models, may still be a concern. It would be useful to discuss potential scalability issues or adaptations for larger-scale scenarios.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a substantive contribution to the field of machine learning model optimization, highlighting an innovative approach that effectively marries Bayesian Optimization with rigorous statistical testing for risk control. While there are areas for clarification and potential expansion upon existing paradigms (particularly in connections to "weak supervised learning"), the proposed framework shows significant promise and has been empirically validated across relevant tasks. The insights from this work could prove valuable for advancing methodologies in safe and responsible AI deployment.
