**Review of "ONEBNET: BINARIZED NEURAL NETWORKS USING DECOMPOSED 1-D BINARIZED CONVOLUTIONS ON EDGE DEVICES"**

**Summary:**
This paper presents OneBNet, a novel architecture for binarized convolutional neural networks (BCNNs) that employs decomposed 1-D binarized convolutions as opposed to traditional 2-D convolutions. The authors argue that their approach enhances performance on CPU-based edge devices, addressing the computational limitations faced in such environments. By utilizing both row-wise and column-wise 1-D convolutions, the paper reports improved accuracy on benchmark datasets such as FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet. The results suggest that OneBNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art binarized networks, particularly in situations where computational resources are constrained.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovation in Approach:** 
   The introduction of decomposed 1-D convolutions is a noteworthy innovation that provides a different perspective on optimizing BCNNs. The ability to leverage both row-wise and column-wise operations seems promising, especially given the rising interest in efficient models suitable for edge computing contexts.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation:**
   The authors conducted extensive experiments on multiple datasets (FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, ImageNet), comparing OneBNet with various state-of-the-art BCNNs, demonstrating its advantages not just in terms of accuracy but also in operational speed and latency.

3. **Clear Presentation of Results:**
   The results are well-organized in tables and figures, making it easy for readers to discern performance differences across models and conditions. The paper effectively details the experimental setup and analysis, thus allowing for reproducibility.

4. **Relevance to Edge Devices:**
   The focus on CPU-based edge devices is timely and relevant. With the growth of IoT and mobile applications, the need for computationally efficient models is paramount. This research addresses that need and sets a foundation for future exploration of lightweight neural networks.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity of Implementation:**
   While the proposed architecture shows promise, its complexity relative to existing methods such as 2-D convolutions might present challenges in terms of practical deployment. The paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion on the trade-offs involved in implementing this architecture in real-world applications.

2. **Limited Discussion on Overhead:**
   The authors mention that while computational costs are reduced with 1-D convolutions, there are added activation layers and biases that could counterbalance some gains. However, a deeper exploration of the overhead introduced by these additional parameters and operations in terms of both computation and memory usage would help readers better understand the practical implications.

3. **Lack of "Weak Supervised Learning" Discussion:**
   Although the proposed work is strong in its technical innovations, there is a notable lack of engagement with the current literature on "weak supervised learning." Given the ongoing debates and advancements in this area, a discussion of how OneBNet interfaces with or can be adapted to such frameworks could enhance the paperâ€™s contributions significantly.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, "ONEBNET: BINARIZED NEURAL NETWORKS USING DECOMPOSED 1-D BINARIZED CONVOLUTIONS ON EDGE DEVICES" represents a well-structured and significant advancement in the realm of efficient neural networks for edge computing. While innovations in model design are commendable, further exploration into implementation complexities and broader contextualizations with existing methodologies would strengthen its impact. The findings could potentially encourage further research, thus contributing meaningfully to both academic discourse and practical applications in machine learning on edge devices.
