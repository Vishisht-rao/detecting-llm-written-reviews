**Review of the Paper: "HOW HARD IS TROJAN DETECTION IN DNNs? FOOLING DETECTORS WITH EVASIVE TROJANS"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a significant advancement in the domain of neural network security, emphasizing the development of evasive trojans that are notably more difficult to detect than standard trojan attacks. The authors investigate the effectiveness of various detection mechanisms against their proposed evasive trojans and highlight a concerning trade-off: while evasive trojans maintain high attack success rates, they significantly reduce the detection capabilities of existing trojan detectors.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Contribution:** 
   - The creation of a method to develop evasive trojans constitutes a notable step forward in the understanding of the offense-defense balance in neural security. The empirical evidence demonstrating that these trojans are harder to detect than standard ones is compelling and underlines the potential escalation in the arms race between attackers and defenders.

2. **Thorough Experimentation:**
   - The authors conducted extensive experiments, training over 6,000 neural networks with various trojan architectures and evaluating performance across multiple datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and GTSRB). Such thoroughness adds credibility to their findings and showcases robust testing methodologies.

3. **Surprising Findings:**
   - The unexpected result that evasive trojans also hinder reverse-engineering attempts significantly adds to the implications of their research. This observation invites further investigation into trojan behavior and suggests the need for novel defensive strategies beyond current detection mechanisms.

4. **Comprehensive Literature Review:**
   - The paper presents a thorough background on existing trojan attacks and detection methods, situating the current work within the relevant literature. This contextualization is essential for readers and strengthens the contribution to the field.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Performance Metrics Clarity:**
   - While the paper utilizes AUROC as a measurement for detector performance, there could be a more detailed discussion regarding how the AUROC values translate into practical implications concerning "weak supervised learning." An exploration of the real-world consequences of reduced detection capabilities could enhance the reader's understanding of the stakes involved.

2. **Discussion on Defenses:**
   - While the paper emphasizes the creation and evaluation of evasive trojans, it could more thoroughly discuss potential defensive strategies or countermeasures that might emerge as a response to this novel threat. A discussion around proactive methodologies to counteract evasive trojans would be valuable.

3. **Lack of Real-World Examples:**
   - The scenarios used to illustrate the potential risks of trojaned networks (e.g., the traffic sign classifier example) are somewhat abstract. More concrete or realistic case studies could enrich the narrative and emphasize urgency for actionable solutions in neural security.

4. **Generalization of Findings:**
   - Although the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of evasive trojans across diverse datasets, it’s worth evaluating how these findings generalize to other applications and domains outside of the tested datasets. Further work could consider applications in varied contexts to enhance robustness in practical scenarios.

**Conclusion:**
This paper offers a crucial exploration into the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks through the lens of evasive trojan attacks. The findings are both relevant and alarming, showcasing a significant gap in current detection methodologies. This work sets the stage for further inquiry into improved detection mechanisms and the design of defenses against the growing sophistication of adversarial tactics in AI systems. Future research that builds upon this foundation will be necessary to address the implications for safety and reliability in AI applications.

Overall, I endorse the paper for acceptance, given its innovative approach and well-supported findings, while encouraging the authors to address the highlighted areas for improvement in future work.### Review of "HOW HARD IS TROJAN DETECTION IN DNNs? FOOLING DETECTORS WITH EVASIVE TROJANS"

#### Summary
The paper presents a novel approach for creating evasive trojans in deep neural networks (DNNs), challenging the existing methods of trojan detection. The authors propose a distribution matching loss inspired by Wasserstein distance, alongside specificity and randomization losses, to conceal trojan functionalities effectively. The findings demonstrate that such evasive trojans significantly reduce the effectiveness of a range of existing detection methods, while also complicating reverse-engineering attempts.

#### Strengths
1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The paper addresses an increasingly relevant issue in adversarial machine learning — the difficulty of detecting trojan attacks in DNNs. The approach of making trojans evasive is innovative, and the emphasis on evaluating detection mechanisms under this new paradigm provides fresh insights for the field.

2. **Robust Experimental Design**: The authors conducted extensive experiments, training over 6,000 neural networks across multiple datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, GTSRB) and different trojan insertion methods. The comprehensive evaluation against various detectors enhances the reliability of their findings.

3. **Surprising Findings**: The unexpected discovery that evasive trojans are harder to reverse-engineer, despite not being explicitly designed for this purpose, underscores the need for robust defenses in trojan detection methodologies.

4. **Clear Presentation**: The organization of the paper is logical, with a well-defined structure comprising an abstract, introduction, related work, methodology, results, and discussions. Figures and tables are used effectively to illustrate key results and findings.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Limited Context on "Weak Supervised Learning"**: The paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion regarding the implications of "weak supervised learning" as it relates to the creation and detection of trojan attacks. The interplay between weakly supervised settings and the evasiveness of trojan models is particularly intriguing and merits further examination.

2. **Performance Metrics Clarity**: While the AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) is a widely accepted metric, the paper might improve clarity by briefly explaining its significance in the context of this study, particularly for readers who may not be familiar with its implications for detection performance.

3. **Generalization and Transferability**: The effectiveness of evasive trojans against a wider variety of detection methods beyond those tested could be discussed further. Future research could explore how well these evasive techniques generalize to different attack scenarios and detector architectures.

4. **Comparative Analysis with Previous Work**: While the authors reference existing techniques, a more thorough comparative analysis with prior evasive methods (like those targeting specific detectors) would further establish the contributions of this work. This contextual framework could help clarify the advantages that their approach brings to the table.

#### Suggestions for Improvement
1. **Enhance Discussion on Weak Supervised Learning**: Including a section that discusses the intersection of “weak supervised learning” with trojan detection dynamics would enrich the theoretical foundation and practical implications of this study.

2. **Incorporate More Visuals or Diagrams**: The inclusion of additional diagrams showing the flow of the evasive techniques or visualizing the mechanics of the distribution-matching loss could bolster understanding.

3. **Further Exploration of Generalization**: Providing insights or hypotheses about how well the proposed methods might adapt to other domains or types of models could stimulate further research and outreach.

#### Conclusion
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of adversarial machine learning, particularly in understanding the complexities of trojan detection. By revealing the evasive nature of trojan attacks using DNNs, it raises important considerations for the development of future detection mechanisms and defenses. Addressing the outlined weaknesses could enhance the impact and clarity of the work. I recommend this paper for acceptance, with the caveat of considering the suggested revisions.
