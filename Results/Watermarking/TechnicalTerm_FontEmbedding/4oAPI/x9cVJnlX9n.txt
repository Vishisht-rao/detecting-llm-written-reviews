Title: Risk-Controlling Model Selection via Guided Bayesian Optimization

Summary:
The paper focuses on addressing the challenge of selecting hyperparameter configurations that satisfy user-defined constraints on various risk metrics while optimizing other conflicting performance metrics. The authors propose a novel approach combining Bayesian Optimization (BO) with rigorously defined risk-controlling statistical procedures. The central idea is to guide the BO process towards regions of the search space where configurations are likely to be both efficient and satisfy the predefined risk constraints. This method involves defining a "region of interest" in the objective space, identifying Pareto optimal solutions within this region, and then validating the selected solutions statistically to ensure they meet risk constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated across several tasks, including fairness, robustness, generative modeling, and model efficiency.

Strengths:
1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The combination of Bayesian Optimization with statistical risk control is novel and addresses a critical need in practical machine learning applications: ensuring models are not only high-performing but also adhere to specific risk constraints such as fairness and robustness.

2. **Comprehensive Framework**: The framework is versatile and can be applied to different types of models and hyperparameters, making it broadly applicable to a variety of machine learning tasks.

3. **Methodological Clarity**: The paper provides a clear explanation and mathematical formulation of the problem, including the definition of the region of interest and the use of Pareto optimality in BO.

4. **Empirical Validation**: The results across multiple scenarios show the effectiveness of the method in both achieving risk constraints and optimizing other objectives, indicating strong empirical support for the proposed approach.

Weaknesses:
1. **Complexity and Accessibility**: The methodology, involving Bayesian Optimization and statistical testing, might be complex for practitioners without a strong background in these areas. It could benefit from more intuitive explanations or visual aids to enhance understanding.

2. **Computational Cost**: Although the proposed method is designed to be more computationally efficient than existing methods, the process of statistical validation, especially under multiple objectives and constraints, could still be computationally demanding. The paper could expand on the scalability aspects and resource requirements.

3. **Selection of Hyperparameters in Practice**: The paper does not provide explicit guidance on how the values of certain parameters, such as the hypervolume reference points or the BO acquisition function, were selected. Detailing these choices could be valuable for replicating the results in practical applications.

4. **Limited Discussion on Limitations and Weaknesses**: While the approach is comprehensive, the paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion on its limitations or potential weaknesses, such as how it handles non-stationarity or distribution shifts in data.

5. **Application to Weak Supervision**: Although the paper demonstrates wide applicability, it does not explicitly discuss scenarios involving "weak supervised learning" where labels might be noisy or imperfect. A discussion on extending this method to such contexts would be valuable.

Conclusion:
The paper presents a significant advancement in hyperparameter optimization by integrating Bayesian Optimization with risk-controlling statistical tests. It offers a compelling solution to the challenge of model selection under multiple constraints, relevant for real-world deployments of machine learning models. Despite some concerns about complexity and computational demands, the approach is well-positioned to be valuable for researchers and practitioners interested in optimizing model performance while adhering to critical risk constraints. Further exploration of its scalability and application in "weak supervised learning" contexts could enhance its practical impact.
