**Review: "A Discretization Framework for Robust Contextual Stochastic Optimization"**

**Summary:**

The paper presents a new discretization framework for addressing robust contextual stochastic optimization problems. This approach is designed to tackle optimization issues where parameters are uncertain and context-dependent, aiming to provide robust solutions under worst-case scenarios. The authors propose an innovative method that combines the learning stage with an understanding of the downstream optimization task. Their approach discretizes the feasible region into subsets, approximating the objective function within each subset. The subsequent optimization problem integrates these approximations to prescribe decisions. Their method provides theoretical guarantees on the underlying regret and demonstrates robustness in various computational experiments compared to existing approaches.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Methodology:** The novelty of discretizing the feasible region to handle robust optimization with uncertain parameters is a significant contribution. This provides a fresh approach compared to traditional methodologies that may rely heavily on assumptions about the distribution or structure of data.

2. **Theoretical Guarantees:** The paper offers rigor through theoretical guarantees, providing bounds on expected regret. This is crucial for validating the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method under varying conditions.

3. **Practical Experimentation:** The experiments are well-executed, including real-world scenarios such as electricity generation and inventory allocation. The results demonstrate competitive performance with notable improvements in robustness metrics, particularly in worst-case scenarios.

4. **Flexibility:** The method's flexibility to be applied across different classes of optimization problems (linear, nonlinear, discrete) without needing to construct explicit uncertainty sets is valuable for broad applications.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity and Scalability:** The paper briefly touches on choosing the parameter \( \epsilon \) for feasible set discretization but does not deeply address the computational complexity or scalability when this parameter grows large or when applied to high-dimensional feasible spaces.

2. **Comparison with Advanced Techniques:** While the paper includes several baselines, it would benefit from a deeper comparison with recent advancements in "weak supervised learning" and Bayesian optimization, as these can be relevant in context-driven decision-making under uncertainty.

3. **Clarity in Explanation:** Some sections, particularly those detailing the mathematical formulations, could be clearer. For instance, more intuitive explanations or diagrams could help clarify complex equations and algorithms for a broader audience.

4. **Limited Discussion on Real-World Constraints:** While practical experiments are included, the discussion on how real-world constraints (e.g., regulatory, operational) might interact with this framework is limited. This can be crucial for practitioners looking to apply these methods.

**Additional Comments:**

- **Interpretability:** Providing insights into how the discretization process affects decision-making could enhance the interpretability of results. For example, understanding how the method trades off between robustness and performance across different problem settings would be valuable.

- **Sensitivity Analysis:** Including a sensitivity analysis of key parameters, such as the robustness threshold \( \epsilon \), could provide further insights into the method's reliability under different assumptions and settings.

Overall, the paper makes a solid contribution to the field of robust contextual stochastic optimization and opens up interesting avenues for future research, especially in areas integrating advanced machine learning techniques. The high potential for practical implementation and theoretical depth makes it a worthwhile read for those interested in optimization under uncertainty.**Review of "A Discretization Framework for Robust Contextual Stochastic Optimization"**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces a novel framework for tackling contextual stochastic optimization problems, characterized by uncertain parameters that depend on context-specific distributions. The authors propose a method that combines the learning phase directly with the optimization task, discretizing the feasible decision space and aligning subset areas with deterministic approximations of the uncertain objective function. The method aims to optimize for robust decisions that minimize regret against an uncertain distribution of outcomes. Additionally, the authors provide theoretical guarantees related to regret and stability and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach using computational experiments on real-world optimization problems, such as electricity generation and inventory management.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty and Relevance:** The novel method of discretizing the feasible decision space in contextual stochastic optimization is relevant and timely, given the increasing number of contexts where decision-making under uncertainty is required.
   
2. **Theoretical Contributions:** The paper provides theoretical guarantees, including a bound on the expected regret and a stability result concerning the perturbation of data, which solidifies the robustness claims of their approach.

3. **Practical Implications:** The empirical evaluations signify substantial improvements in the worst-case cost, underscoring the practical applicability of the method across a spectrum of optimization tasks.

4. **Comparative Analysis:** By contrasting their approach with various existing robust and end-to-end optimization techniques, the authors paint a clear picture of where their method stands, especially in terms of robustness in adverse scenarios, showing up to 20 times lower worst-case costs in some applications.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Clarity and Readability:** While the technical content is substantial, certain sections of the paper, particularly involving the mathematical formulations, could be made more accessible with detailed explanations and illustrations.

2. **Assumptions:** Some of the assumptions, particularly those ensuring bi-Lipschitz conditions and bounded regret, might limit the generality of the proposed method. It would be advantageous to discuss the impact and practical implications of relaxing these assumptions.

3. **"Weak Supervised Learning" Aspect:** The method implicitly relies on "weak supervised learning" in mapping decisions to subsets of feasible regions using context data, but the paper could benefit from a more explicit treatment of this aspect, especially since the method requires accurate estimates of subset membership probabilities.

4. **Computational Complexity:** While the authors propose a promising method, a more detailed discussion regarding the computational complexity and scalability of the approach would be crucial, given real-world scenarios often involve high-dimensional data and large-scale optimization problems.

5. **Experimentation Scope:** Although the empirical results are impressive, expanding the experimentation to other problem domains, potentially with more complex distributions, would strengthen the generality claims of the proposed framework.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. **Detailed Examples and Illustrations:** Include more visualizations or examples, especially to illustrate the discretization process and how it enhances the alignment of the predicted solutions with true optimal solutions across scenarios.
   
2. **Explicit Discussion on "Weak Supervised Learning":** Integrate a discussion on how this method relates to "weak supervised learning" paradigms and the impact of learning model selection on final performance.

3. **Complexity Analysis:** Provide an analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method and discuss potential approaches to mitigate scalability issues.

4. **Feature Space Considerations:** Discuss potential limitations in the model capacity and suggest methods for handling high-dimensional data effectively.

5. **Extended Experimentation and Ablation Studies:** Further experimentation that explores varying data distributions and systematic ablation studies that dissect the contributions of different components in the method could offer deeper insight into the robustness and versatility of the approach.

**Overall Assessment:**
This paper makes a notable contribution to the field of contextual stochastic optimization by introducing a robust framework combining novel discretization techniques and theoretical insights. Despite its few areas for improvement, particularly in clarity and scalability discussions, this paper is a valuable addition and worthy of consideration for presentation at ICLR 2024.
