OUTPUT:
Here's my review of the paper "One-shot Empirical Privacy Estimation for Federated Learning":

This paper presents a novel approach for empirically estimating privacy loss in federated learning systems through a "one-shot" method that can be performed during the actual model training process. The key innovation is using randomly generated "canary" clients whose updates are designed to be orthogonal to real client updates, allowing measurement of information leakage through the angle between canary updates and the final model parameters.

Strengths:
1. The proposed method addresses important practical limitations of existing privacy auditing approaches, particularly the need for multiple training runs and specific knowledge of model architecture/data.

2. The theoretical analysis is thorough, with clear proofs showing that the method provides provably correct estimates for the Gaussian mechanism in high dimensions.

3. The experimental validation is comprehensive, testing both the final-model-only and all-iterates threat models across different datasets and privacy settings.

4. The method is highly practical and efficient since it can be performed during the actual training run without significantly impacting model performance.

Weaknesses:
1. While the paper shows the method works well empirically, there could be more theoretical analysis of why random canaries provide good privacy estimates in the general federated learning case beyond just the Gaussian mechanism.

2. The assumption that model dimensionality needs to be "high enough" could be explored more precisely - what exactly constitutes "high enough" in practice?

Innovation:
The paper presents a truly novel approach that fundamentally changes how privacy auditing can be done in federated learning systems. Rather than requiring many training runs or complex attack simulations, it provides a simple yet theoretically grounded way to estimate privacy loss during normal training.

Impact:
This work could have significant practical impact by making privacy auditing much more feasible in real-world federated learning deployments. The ability to continuously monitor privacy loss during training without extra overhead is particularly valuable.

The paper is well-written and the methodology is clearly explained. The theoretical foundations are sound and the experimental validation is thorough. While there are some areas that could benefit from deeper analysis, overall this represents an important contribution to privacy-preserving federated learning.

Note: The paper doesn't specifically discuss "weak supervised learning", but its approach could potentially be extended to such settings in future work.Here's my review of the paper "One-shot Empirical Privacy Estimation for Federated Learning":

This paper presents a novel approach for estimating privacy guarantees in federated learning (FL) systems through a single training run, addressing significant practical challenges in privacy auditing. The key innovation is the use of random "canary" clients that allow privacy loss estimation without requiring multiple training runs or specific knowledge about the model architecture or task.

Strengths:
1. The method is highly practical, requiring only a single training run rather than thousands of runs as needed by previous approaches. This is particularly valuable for FL systems where training is computationally expensive.

2. The approach is model and task agnostic, making it widely applicable across different FL applications without modification.

3. The paper provides strong theoretical foundations, including proofs of asymptotic correctness for the Gaussian mechanism case.

4. The experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness on real-world FL benchmarks (Stackoverflow and EMNIST datasets).

5. The paper thoroughly compares different threat models (access to all iterates vs. final model only) and explores how privacy guarantees change with different client participation patterns.

Weaknesses:
1. While the method performs well empirically, there isn't a formal proof that the estimated ε provides a strict bound on privacy loss.

2. The assumption that randomly sampled canaries will be orthogonal to real updates in high dimensions could benefit from more theoretical analysis.

3. The paper could provide more guidance on selecting the number of canary clients for different scenarios.

Impact and Innovation:
The paper makes a significant contribution to practical privacy estimation in FL systems. The one-shot approach represents a major improvement over existing methods that require multiple training runs or make strong assumptions about the adversary's knowledge. The method's ability to work without specific knowledge of the model or task makes it particularly valuable for large-scale FL deployments.

Technical Soundness:
The theoretical analysis is rigorous, particularly in proving the asymptotic correctness for the Gaussian mechanism case. The experimental methodology is thorough, testing the approach across different datasets, noise levels, and threat models.

Presentation:
The paper is well-written and clearly structured. The technical content is accessible while maintaining rigor. The figures effectively illustrate the method's performance and characteristics.

Future Directions:
The paper opens interesting directions for future research, including:
- Formal analysis of conditions under which the estimated ε provides privacy bounds
- Extensions to other privacy mechanisms beyond Gaussian noise
- Applications to "weak supervised learning" scenarios

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes both theoretical and practical contributions to privacy estimation in federated learning. The one-shot approach addresses real practical needs while maintaining theoretical rigor.

Recommendation: Accept. The paper presents significant innovations that advance the field of privacy estimation for federated learning systems.
