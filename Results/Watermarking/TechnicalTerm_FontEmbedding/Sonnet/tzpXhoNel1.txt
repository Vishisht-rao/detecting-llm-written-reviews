2. The empirical results demonstrate strong performance on:
- Synthetic datasets with various group symmetries (O(5), O(3), O(1,3))
- Image classification using MLP-mixers
- N-body dynamics prediction using MPNNs 
- PDE solving using Fourier Neural Operators

3. The authors provide theoretical analysis including proofs of the architecture's universality properties.

4. The work introduces an innovative use of second-order tensor representations for equivariant image classification that outperforms existing methods.

Weaknesses:
1. While the paper demonstrates improved computational efficiency compared to EMLPs, a more detailed theoretical analysis of the computational complexity would strengthen the claims.

2. The experiments could benefit from additional ablation studies to better understand the contribution of different components of the architecture.

3. The comparison with other recent equivariant architectures could be more comprehensive.

Technical Innovation:
The key technical innovation lies in the simple yet effective approach of using tensor representations in hidden layers along with appropriate mixing of representations. This provides a more scalable alternative to existing methods while maintaining equivariance guarantees.
