OUTPUT:
Here is my review of the paper "Risk-Controlling Model Selection via Guided Bayesian Optimization":

This paper presents a novel approach combining Bayesian Optimization (BO) with statistical testing procedures to select model configurations that satisfy multiple risk constraints while optimizing other performance metrics. The key contribution is introducing a "region of interest" concept to focus the BO search on configurations likely to be both valid and efficient.

Strengths:
1. The paper addresses an important practical problem of selecting model configurations that provide statistical guarantees on multiple risk constraints.

2. The proposed method is theoretically well-grounded, combining rigorous statistical testing with efficient BO-based search.

3. The approach is demonstrated on diverse and relevant applications including fairness, robustness, VAE optimization, and model compression.

4. The experimental results show clear advantages over baseline methods, particularly in achieving tighter and more stable control across different conditions.

5. The paper is well-written and structured, with clear explanations of technical concepts and detailed empirical validation.

Weaknesses:
1. While the method shows good results with small optimization budgets (N=10-50), scalability to higher dimensional configuration spaces could be better discussed.

2. The sensitivity analysis of the δ' parameter (controlling region of interest width) could be more comprehensive.

3. The computational overhead of the proposed method compared to simpler approaches is not extensively analyzed.

Suggestions for improvement:
1. Include more discussion on computational complexity and overhead.

2. Expand the analysis of how the method performs as the dimensionality of the configuration space increases.

3. Consider adding comparisons to other statistical testing frameworks beyond Pareto Testing.

4. Provide more guidance on selecting appropriate bounds α based on initial configuration pools.

Overall Assessment:
This is a strong paper that makes both theoretical and practical contributions to the important problem of risk-controlled model selection. The proposed method effectively combines optimization and statistical testing in a novel way, with compelling empirical results across multiple applications. The paper would be a valuable addition to the ICLR program.

The main strengths are the theoretical soundness, practical applicability, and comprehensive empirical validation. While there are some areas that could be expanded, these do not significantly detract from the paper's contributions.
