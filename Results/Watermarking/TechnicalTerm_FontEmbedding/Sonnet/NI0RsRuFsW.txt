Here's my review of the paper "How Hard is Trojan Detection in DNNs? Fooling Detectors with Evasive Trojans":

This paper presents an important investigation into the vulnerability of trojan detection methods for deep neural networks. The authors develop a novel approach for creating "evasive trojans" that are significantly harder to detect while maintaining high attack success rates.

Key Strengths:
1. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors conduct extensive experiments across multiple datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, GTSRB) and evaluate against 8 different detection methods, providing robust evidence for their claims.

2. Novel Technical Approach: The proposed method combines several innovative components including distribution matching loss inspired by Wasserstein distance, specificity loss, and randomization loss to create more evasive trojans.

3. Surprising Findings: The discovery that their evasive trojans are not only harder to detect but also more difficult to reverse-engineer (without explicitly optimizing for this) is an important and concerning result for the field.

4. Rigorous Methodology: The authors employ a white-box threat model that gives defenders full access to training sets, making their results more meaningful and robust.

Limitations:
1. The paper could benefit from more theoretical analysis of why the proposed method works, particularly regarding the unexpected difficulty in reverse-engineering.

2. While the empirical results are strong, there could be more discussion about potential defensive countermeasures.

3. The scope of experiments focuses mainly on image classification tasks - additional domains could strengthen the findings.

Research Impact:
This work makes several important contributions:
- Demonstrates fundamental limitations in current trojan detection approaches
- Provides a general framework for creating evasive trojans
- Highlights the need for more robust monitoring mechanisms
- Raises important questions about the offense-defense balance in neural network security

The methodology is sound and the extensive experimental validation (over 6,000 neural networks trained) provides strong support for the claims. The work has important implications for the security and trustworthiness of deployed neural networks.

Future Directions:
The paper opens up several interesting research directions including:
- Development of more robust detection methods
- Theoretical understanding of trojan evasion
- Extension to other domains beyond computer vision
- Investigation of potential defensive strategies

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes valuable contributions to our understanding of neural network security and trojan detection. The findings should encourage the community to develop more robust monitoring mechanisms for hidden functionality in neural networks.

The paper would fit well in a top-tier conference like ICLR given its technical depth, thorough evaluation, and important implications for the field. While it doesn't explicitly address "weak supervised learning", its findings have broader implications for neural network reliability and security.

Score: 8/10Here's my review of the paper "How Hard is Trojan Detection in DNNs? Fooling Detectors with Evasive Trojans":

This paper presents an important investigation into the vulnerability of trojan detection methods for deep neural networks. The authors develop a novel approach for creating "evasive trojans" that can bypass current detection methods while maintaining high attack success rates.

Strengths:

1. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors conduct extensive experiments across multiple datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, GTSRB) and evaluate their method against 8 different detection approaches, including both traditional and state-of-the-art detectors.

2. Novel Methodology: The proposed method introduces several innovative components:
- A distribution matching loss inspired by Wasserstein distance
- A specificity loss to prevent unintended trigger activation
- A randomization loss to avoid emergent coordination

3. Rigorous Testing: The study employs a white-box threat model and evaluates over 6,000 neural networks, providing strong empirical evidence for their findings.

4. Unexpected Insights: The discovery that evasive trojans are not only harder to detect but also more difficult to reverse-engineer (despite not being explicitly designed for this) is a significant and concerning finding.

Weaknesses:

1. Limited Scope: The paper focuses primarily on image classification tasks and might benefit from exploring other domains or architectures.

2. Computational Resources: The approach requires training large numbers of networks, which may be computationally intensive and less practical for real-world applications.

3. Defense Mechanisms: While the paper demonstrates the vulnerability of existing detection methods, it could provide more discussion on potential countermeasures or defensive strategies.

Impact and Significance:
This work makes several important contributions to the field of AI security:
- Demonstrates fundamental limitations in current trojan detection methods
- Provides insights into the relationship between detectability and reverse-engineering
- Highlights the need for more robust monitoring mechanisms

The paper effectively argues for a paradigm shift in trojan detection research toward constructive adversarial development, where increasingly evasive trojans help identify and address detector limitations.

Future Directions:
The work opens several interesting research directions, including:
- Development of more robust detection methods
- Investigation of the relationship between evasiveness and reverse-engineering difficulty
- Extension to other domains and network architectures

In conclusion, this is a well-executed study that makes significant contributions to our understanding of trojan detection challenges in deep neural networks. The findings have important implications for the development of secure AI systems and highlight critical areas for future research.
