OUTPUT:
This paper addresses a critical issue in adversarial training (AT): the use of surrogate losses (like cross-entropy) in place of the discontinuous 0-1 loss for computational tractability. While common practice, the authors argue this substitution creates a fundamental flaw, leading to weak attackers and ineffective defenses.  They demonstrate how maximizing a surrogate loss doesn't guarantee an increase in classification error, resulting in suboptimal adversarial examples.  Similarly, training against these weak examples doesn't guarantee improved robustness, and contributes to issues like robust overfitting.

To remedy this, the paper proposes a novel non-zero-sum bilevel formulation of AT. The attacker maximizes a continuous reformulation of the classification error based on the negative margin, while the defender minimizes an upper bound (like cross-entropy) on the *perturbed* classification error. This decoupling of objectives, they argue, preserves optimality guarantees while yielding a more robust model.

Based on this formulation, they introduce a new attack algorithm called BETA (Best Targeted Attack) and a corresponding training algorithm, BETA-AT.  Empirically, they demonstrate on CIFAR-10 that BETA-AT achieves competitive robustness compared to existing methods, and importantly, does *not* exhibit robust overfitting.  Furthermore, they show that BETA, as an attack, matches the performance of the state-of-the-art AutoAttack, despite being significantly simpler and faster, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed negative margin objective.

**Strengths:**

* **Identifies a key weakness:** The paper clearly articulates the limitations of using surrogate losses in AT, providing a strong theoretical motivation for their proposed approach.
* **Elegant solution:** The non-zero-sum bilevel formulation is a natural and principled way to address the identified weakness.
* **Strong empirical results:** BETA-AT shows competitive robustness and eliminates robust overfitting. BETA, as an attack, matches AutoAttack's performance with less complexity.
* **Well-written and clear:** The paper is well-organized and clearly explains the problem and proposed solution.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited scope of experiments:** While the CIFAR-10 experiments are compelling, evaluating the approach on larger datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and other architectures would strengthen the claims.
* **Computational cost of BETA-AT:** The paper acknowledges the increased computational cost of BETA-AT compared to traditional methods.  Exploring strategies to mitigate this cost would be beneficial.
* **Lack of theoretical analysis for BETA-AT:**  While the paper provides theoretical justification for the non-zero-sum formulation, it lacks a formal analysis of BETA-AT's convergence properties or robustness guarantees.


**Overall:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of adversarial training by identifying a fundamental limitation of current practices and proposing a principled solution. The empirical results are promising and the theoretical arguments are convincing. Further investigation on larger datasets and exploration of computational efficiency would further solidify the impact of this work.  The introduction of BETA as a simple yet effective attack is also a notable contribution.  This paper is well worth reading for researchers working on adversarial robustness.
