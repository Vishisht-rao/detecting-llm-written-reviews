This paper investigates the challenging problem of Trojan detection in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), focusing on enhancing the "evasive" nature of Trojans to bypass existing detection methods. The authors propose a novel method to create these evasive Trojans, employing techniques like distribution matching loss (inspired by Wasserstein distance), specificity loss, and a randomization loss. The key strength lies in adopting a white-box threat model, providing the detectors full access to the training data of evasive Trojans, thus ensuring a more robust evaluation.

The experimental results are compelling.  Across a wide range of datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, GTSRB) and established detection methods (including Neural Cleanse, ABS, K-Arm, and meta-network detectors), the evasive Trojans demonstrate a significant reduction in detection performance, sometimes even to chance levels.  Furthermore, a surprising and concerning finding is the increased difficulty in reverse-engineering these evasive Trojans, despite not being explicitly designed for this property. This raises crucial questions about the current offense-defense balance in Trojan detection.

The paper is well-written and technically sound. The methodology is clearly explained, and the experiments are comprehensive.  The ablation studies effectively demonstrate the contributions of different components of their proposed method. The unexpected finding regarding reverse-engineering adds significant value and opens up new research directions.

However, some aspects could be further explored.  The authors could provide more details on the computational cost of their method, particularly the distribution matching component.  A discussion on the potential limitations and the generalizability of their approach to other types of Trojan attacks and network architectures would also be beneficial.  Finally, exploring potential countermeasures against these evasive Trojans would strengthen the paper's impact.

Despite these minor points, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of Trojan detection. It highlights the potential for creating highly evasive Trojans and underscores the need for developing more robust detection and monitoring mechanisms.  The surprising results related to reverse-engineering are particularly concerning and deserve further investigation.  This work has the potential to significantly influence future research in this critical area of DNN security.
