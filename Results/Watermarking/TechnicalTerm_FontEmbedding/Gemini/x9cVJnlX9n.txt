OUTPUT:
This paper proposes a novel method for risk-controlling model selection using guided Bayesian Optimization (BO).  The key innovation lies in defining a "region of interest" within the objective space, effectively focusing the BO search on configurations likely to satisfy user-defined risk thresholds while optimizing other conflicting metrics. This targeted approach addresses limitations of existing methods like Learn Then Test (LTT) and Pareto Testing, which can be computationally expensive or explore irrelevant configurations.

The paper is well-written and clearly motivated. The problem formulation is well-defined, and the proposed solution is technically sound. The introduction of the region of interest is a significant contribution, directly linking the optimization process to the downstream statistical testing.  The adjusted BO procedure, using a modified hypervolume improvement acquisition function, effectively targets this region. The subsequent use of multiple hypothesis testing provides statistical guarantees on the selected configuration.

The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method across diverse tasks, including fairness, robustness, generative modeling (VAEs), and model compression. The comparisons to baseline methods, including uniform/random search, standard multi-objective BO, and Pareto Testing, clearly showcase the advantages of the guided approach.  The ablation studies further strengthen the analysis by investigating the impact of different components of the method.

Strengths:

* **Novelty:** The region of interest concept is a valuable contribution.
* **Sound Methodology:**  The proposed approach is well-grounded in theory and practice.
* **Strong Empirical Results:** The experiments convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness across various tasks.
* **Clear Presentation:** The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:

* **Limited Theoretical Analysis:** While the method is well-motivated, a more formal theoretical analysis of its properties (e.g., convergence, optimality) would strengthen the paper.
* **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters:** While the experiments suggest robustness to the  Î´' hyperparameter, further investigation into its impact and potential automatic tuning strategies would be beneficial.
* **Scalability to Higher Dimensions:**  The experiments primarily focus on lower-dimensional hyperparameter spaces.  Exploring the scalability of the method to higher dimensions would be an interesting future direction.


Overall, this paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of risk-controlling model selection. The proposed method is novel, well-motivated, and empirically validated. Addressing the minor weaknesses mentioned above would further enhance the paper's impact.  It is a strong candidate for acceptance at ICLR 2024.
