OUTPUT:
This paper presents a novel discretization framework for robust contextual stochastic optimization.  The authors tackle the challenge of making optimal decisions under uncertainty where the distribution of uncertain parameters is unknown and context-dependent. The key innovation lies in combining the learning and optimization stages by discretizing the feasible region and maximizing the likelihood of the cost falling below a user-defined threshold.

**Strengths:**

* **Novel Approach:** The discretization approach offers a fresh perspective on contextual stochastic optimization. It directly incorporates robustness into the decision-making process, addressing a critical limitation of traditional predict-then-optimize methods and many end-to-end learning approaches.
* **Data-Driven and Distribution-Free:** The method is data-driven and does not require any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the uncertain parameters, making it applicable to a wide range of real-world scenarios.
* **Theoretical Guarantees:** The paper provides theoretical bounds on the regret of the proposed method, enhancing its credibility and offering insights into its performance characteristics. The stability analysis under data perturbations further strengthens the theoretical foundation.
* **Strong Empirical Performance:** The experimental results across diverse applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. The improvement in robustness, particularly in the worst-case scenarios, is noteworthy. The electricity generation example showcases a significant reduction in worst-case costs compared to existing methods.
* **Clear Presentation:** The paper is well-written and clearly explains the proposed method, its theoretical underpinnings, and the experimental setup. The illustrative figures and detailed discussion of parameter choices are helpful.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Computational Cost:** While the paper addresses tractability improvements, the computational cost, particularly for large-scale problems or complex feasible regions, could still be a concern.  A more in-depth discussion of the computational complexity and scalability would be beneficial.
* **Choice of €:** The discretization parameter € plays a crucial role in the method's performance. The paper offers guidance on its selection but acknowledges that it's a case-by-case process. A more systematic or adaptive approach for determining € could enhance the method's practicality.
* **Limited Discussion of Uncertainty Set Methods:** While the paper compares against some robust optimization techniques, a more extensive discussion of how the discretization framework relates to, and potentially improves upon, traditional uncertainty set methods would be valuable.
* **Future Directions:** The paper mentions future directions, such as considering uncertainty in constraints.  Expanding on these directions, perhaps with preliminary results or theoretical analysis, would add further value.


**Overall:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of contextual stochastic optimization. The discretization framework is novel, theoretically sound, and empirically effective, particularly for achieving robustness. Addressing the weaknesses mentioned above, specifically regarding computational cost and parameter selection, would further strengthen the paper and broaden its impact.  The work opens up promising avenues for future research in robust decision-making under uncertainty.
