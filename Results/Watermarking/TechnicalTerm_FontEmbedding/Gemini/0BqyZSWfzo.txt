This paper presents a novel "one-shot" approach to empirically estimate privacy loss in federated learning (FL), addressing significant shortcomings of existing methods.  Traditional privacy auditing techniques require retraining the model numerous times, often rely on knowledge of the model architecture or dataset, and grant unrealistic power to the adversary.  This new method overcomes these limitations by efficiently estimating privacy loss during a *single* training run, without prior knowledge of the model or data, and under more realistic adversarial assumptions.

The core idea involves inserting multiple "canary" clients with random model updates into the FL protocol. By analyzing the cosine similarity between these canary updates and the final model (or intermediate updates for a stronger adversary), the method estimates the algorithm's tendency to memorize updates.  This approach is theoretically grounded, with provable correctness for the Gaussian mechanism in high dimensions.

The experimental results on benchmark datasets (Stackoverflow and EMNIST) are promising.  They show that the method accurately recovers the true privacy loss for the Gaussian mechanism. In FL scenarios, the estimated privacy loss is far lower when only the final model is released compared to when all intermediate updates are available, reinforcing the practical observation that releasing only the final model improves privacy.  The flexibility of the method is also demonstrated by its ability to estimate privacy under different client participation patterns.

Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of privacy-preserving FL.  The one-shot approach significantly reduces the computational overhead of privacy estimation, making it practical for real-world deployments.  The method's model and dataset agnosticism further enhances its applicability. While not providing a formal privacy bound, the proposed metric offers a practical and efficient way to assess and compare privacy leakage under various scenarios.  Future work on formally relating the metric to theoretical privacy bounds would further strengthen its value.
