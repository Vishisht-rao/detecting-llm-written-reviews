**Review of "DISCOVERING ENVIRONMENTS WITH XRM" for ICLR 2024**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces *CROSS-RISKMINIMIZATION (XRM)*, a novel algorithm designed to automatically discover environments critical for domain generalization (DG) without relying on human-annotated environment labels. XRM addresses the limitations of existing methods that depend on environment annotations by training twin networks on random halves of the training data. These networks imitate confident held-out mistakes from each other, fostering an "echo-chamber" effect that emphasizes spurious correlations while preserving invariant features. The discovered environments are then used to train DG algorithms, achieving oracle-like worst-group accuracy across various benchmarks. The method ensures robust AI system performance across different applications by eliminating the need for resource-intensive human annotations and mitigating perceptual biases inherent in manual labeling.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach:** XRM presents a unique methodology for environment discovery by leveraging twin networks and label flipping, which diverges from traditional methods that require precise hyperparameter tuning and early-stopping based on human-annotated validation sets.

2. **Elimination of Human Annotations:** By removing the dependency on human-annotated environments, XRM significantly reduces the resource burden and potential biases introduced by manual labeling, making DG more scalable and objective.

3. **Empirical Validation:** The paper provides comprehensive experimental results across six standard datasets, including both image and natural language benchmarks. XRM consistently matches or surpasses oracle performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in various scenarios.

4. **Efficiency:** Compared to other environment discovery methods like Learning to Split (LS), XRM offers substantial computational efficiency. For instance, on the Waterbirds dataset, XRM completes in minutes versus hours required by LS, highlighting its practicality for large-scale applications.

5. **Clarity and Detail:** The methodology is thoroughly explained with clear algorithmic steps, pseudocode, and supplementary PyTorch implementation details. The inclusion of visualizations and ablation studies further elucidates XRM's operational dynamics and robustness.

6. **Contribution to "Weak Supervised Learning":** XRM contributes to the broader field of "weak supervised learning" by demonstrating how minimal supervision (random data splits) can effectively guide DG algorithms to discover meaningful environments.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Theoretical Foundations:** While the empirical results are compelling, the theoretical underpinnings of why XRM effectively isolates spurious correlations and preserves invariances are not fully explored. A deeper theoretical analysis would enhance the understanding and credibility of the proposed method.

2. **Limited Exploration of Failure Cases:** Although the paper acknowledges potential limitations related to the invariance principle and causal structures, it could benefit from a more extensive exploration of scenarios where XRM might struggle, such as highly entangled spurious and invariant features or environments that do not align well with the echo-chamber mechanism.

3. **Comparison Scope:** The comparison with other environment discovery methods is somewhat limited. Including a broader range of contemporary approaches, especially those emerging in the realm of "weak supervised learning," would provide a more holistic view of XRM's relative performance and advantages.

4. **Scalability to Complex Environments:** The datasets used, while standard, primarily involve binary or clearly separable environments. It remains unclear how XRM performs in more complex environments with multiple spurious factors or continuous environment variables.

**Questions/Concerns:**

1. **Sensitivity to Initial Data Splits:** How sensitive is XRM to the initial random splitting of training data into held-in and held-out sets? Does the performance vary significantly with different random seeds?

2. **Hyperparameter Robustness:** While XRM provides a recipe for hyperparameter tuning based on label flipping, how robust is this method across diverse datasets and DG algorithms? Are there scenarios where the flip-based criterion might not correlate well with downstream performance?

3. **Extension to Multi-Class and Multi-Environment Scenarios:** How does XRM scale to multi-class classification tasks or scenarios with more than two environments? Are there inherent limitations or necessary modifications to handle such complexities?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Enhance Theoretical Insights:** Incorporate a more detailed theoretical analysis explaining why and under what conditions XRM successfully isolates spurious correlations and preserves invariant features. This could involve formalizing the relationship between label flipping and environment discovery.

2. **Broaden Experimental Evaluation:** Extend experiments to include datasets with more complex environment structures, such as multi-class classifications or environments influenced by multiple spurious attributes. Additionally, assess performance in real-world applications beyond standard benchmarks.

3. **Expand Comparative Analysis:** Include comparisons with a wider array of environment discovery methods, particularly those within the "weak supervised learning" framework, to better position XRM within the current research landscape.

4. **Investigate Scalability:** Explore the scalability of XRM in terms of computational resources and performance when applied to larger datasets or models with higher complexity. Providing insights into memory and time requirements would be beneficial.

5. **Provide Failure Case Analyses:** Present detailed analyses of scenarios where XRM fails or underperforms, offering insights into potential improvements or adjustments needed to handle such cases effectively.

**Overall Evaluation:**
The paper presents a significant advancement in the field of domain generalization by introducing XRM, which effectively automates environment discovery without human annotations. The method's ability to achieve oracle-like performance across multiple benchmarks underscores its potential impact. While the empirical results are strong, the paper would benefit from a deeper theoretical exploration and broader experimental evaluations to fully establish XRM's robustness and generalizability. Nevertheless, XRM represents a valuable contribution to "weak supervised learning" and robust AI system development.

**Recommendation:** **Accept with minor revisions.**
