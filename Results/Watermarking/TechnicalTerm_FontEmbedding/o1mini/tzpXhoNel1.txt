**Review of "GREPSNET: A SIMPLE EQUIVARIANT NETWORK FOR ARBITRARY MATRIX GROUPS"**

**Summary:**

The paper introduces **GRepsNet**, a novel neural network architecture designed to achieve group equivariance for arbitrary matrix groups efficiently. Building upon prior work like Equivariant MLPs (EMLPs) by Finzi et al. (2021), which struggles with scalability, GRepsNet employs tensor representations of various orders alongside strategic mixing techniques to construct expressive and scalable equivariant networks. The authors validate their approach through a series of experiments across multiple domains, including synthetic regression tasks, image classification with MLP-Mixers, N-body dynamics prediction using message passing neural networks (MPNNs), and solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs). Additionally, the paper explores the benefits of higher-order tensor representations (T₂) for "weak supervised learning," demonstrating superior performance over existing methods like equitune.

**Strengths:**

1. **Generality and Flexibility:** GRepsNet is designed to handle arbitrary matrix groups, extending beyond the limitations of specialized architectures such as vector neurons restricted to SO(3). This broad applicability is a significant advancement, enabling the framework to be utilized across diverse domains and group symmetries.

2. **Scalability:** A primary contribution of GRepsNet is its computational efficiency compared to EMLPs. The architecture maintains performance without incurring the high computational costs associated with EMLPs, making it suitable for larger datasets and more complex tasks.

3. **Comprehensive Empirical Validation:** The authors provide extensive experimental results across various tasks and domains, demonstrating that GRepsNet not only competes with but often outperforms existing equivariant and non-equivariant models. The inclusion of both synthetic and real-world datasets strengthens the validity of their claims.

4. **Innovative Use of Tensor Representations:** The exploration and application of higher-order tensor representations (T₂) for "weak supervised learning" and other tasks are novel. This approach highlights the potential for richer feature representations to enhance model performance beyond first-order tensors (T₁).

5. **Theoretical Foundations:** The paper includes proofs of equivariance for the GRepsNet architecture and discusses its universal approximation capabilities for invariant scalar and equivariant vector functions. This theoretical grounding provides a solid basis for the empirical results presented.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Discussion on "Weak Supervised Learning":** While the inclusion of the term "weak supervised learning" is requested, the paper does not explicitly address this area. If GRepsNet is intended to benefit "weak supervised learning" scenarios, the authors should elaborate on how group equivariance enhances performance under such conditions.

2. **Complexity of Tensor Operations:** Although GRepsNet is presented as a simple and scalable architecture, the use of multiple tensor representations and their conversions might introduce implementation complexity. More detailed guidelines, pseudo-code, or implementation examples would aid researchers and practitioners in adopting the framework.

3. **Comparisons with Broader Range of Models:** The experiments primarily compare GRepsNet with EMLPs and standard non-equivariant models. Including comparisons with a wider array of state-of-the-art equivariant architectures, such as SE(3)-Transformers or other recent models, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of GRepsNet's performance.

4. **Lack of Ablation Studies:** The paper could benefit from ablation studies that isolate the impact of different components within GRepsNet, such as varying the orders of tensor representations or different mixing strategies. This would offer deeper insights into which aspects of the architecture contribute most significantly to its performance.

5. **Practical Limitations:** While GRepsNet scales better than EMLPs, the paper does not thoroughly discuss its limitations when dealing with extremely large groups or very high-dimensional data. Addressing potential bottlenecks or outlining future directions to overcome these challenges would enhance the paper's practical relevance.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Elaborate on "Weak Supervised Learning":** If GRepsNet offers advantages in "weak supervised learning" scenarios, the authors should explicitly discuss this connection. Including experiments that showcase its performance in contexts with limited labeled data or noisy annotations would strengthen the paper's contributions.

2. **Provide Implementation Details:** Including more detailed implementation guidelines, such as pseudo-code, architectural diagrams, or links to code repositories, would make GRepsNet more accessible to the research community and facilitate reproducibility.

3. **Expand Comparative Analysis:** Incorporate experiments that compare GRepsNet with a broader set of equivariant models, including the latest advancements. This would position GRepsNet more clearly within the existing landscape and highlight its unique advantages.

4. **Conduct Ablation Studies:** Perform systematic ablation studies to determine the impact of different tensor orders, mixing mechanisms, and layer configurations. This analysis would provide valuable insights into the architecture's strengths and inform future improvements.

5. **Discuss Scalability Limits:** Address potential scalability limits of GRepsNet, especially concerning very large or complex groups and high-dimensional data. Providing strategies or proposing future research directions to mitigate these limitations would enhance the paper's practical applicability.

**Conclusion:**

"GREPSNET: A SIMPLE EQUIVARIANT NETWORK FOR ARBITRARY MATRIX GROUPS" presents a significant advancement in the design of scalable and general group equivariant neural networks. GRepsNet's ability to maintain computational efficiency while achieving competitive performance across diverse tasks underscores its potential as a versatile tool in equivariant deep learning. Addressing the identified weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements would further solidify the paper's contributions and impact.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend **accepting** this paper for publication, provided that the authors address the aforementioned weaknesses and consider the suggested improvements to enhance the clarity, comprehensiveness, and applicability of their work.
