**Review of "You Only Look at Screens: Multimodal Chain-of-Action Agents"**

*Summary:*
The paper presents **Auto-UI**, a novel multimodal autonomous agent designed for user interface (UI) control without relying on environment parsing or application-specific APIs. By directly interacting with UI screens, Auto-UI circumvents common limitations associated with inference inefficiency and error propagation found in existing sandbox-based approaches. The authors introduce a **chain-of-action** technique that leverages historical actions and future action plans to enhance decision-making. Evaluated on the AITW benchmark with 30K unique instructions across various multi-step tasks, Auto-UI achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 90% action type prediction accuracy and a 74% overall action success rate. Additionally, Auto-UI demonstrates remarkable computational efficiency, executing actions in under one second with significantly lower GPU memory usage compared to models like Llama 2.

*Strengths:*

1. **Innovative Approach:** Auto-UI's direct interaction with UI screens represents a significant shift from traditional methods that depend on textual environment parsing. This approach not only reduces inference time but also minimizes the risk of information loss and error propagation inherent in parsing steps.

2. **Chain-of-Action Technique:** The introduction of a chain-of-action mechanism, which incorporates both previous actions and future plans, provides a robust framework for action prediction. This technique enhances the agent's ability to maintain context and make informed decisions across multi-step tasks.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The evaluation on the AITW benchmark is thorough, covering diverse tasks like application operation, web searching, and shopping. The inclusion of multiple subsets ensures that the model's generalization capabilities are rigorously tested.

4. **Performance Metrics:** Achieving a 90% accuracy in action type prediction and a 74% success rate is commendable, especially given the model's computational efficiency. The ablation studies further substantiate the contributions of the chain-of-action and coordinate normalization components.

5. **Efficiency:** Auto-UI's ability to perform actions in under one second with significantly reduced GPU memory requirements (less than 10GB) is a notable advantage, making it more feasible for real-world deployments compared to larger models.

*Areas for Improvement:*

1. **Inclusion of "Weak Supervised Learning":** While the paper highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of Auto-UI, it would benefit from a discussion on how **"weak supervised learning"** techniques could further enhance the model's performance or simplify the training process. Integrating this term could provide insights into potential future directions or alternative methodologies.

2. **Handling Data Imbalance:** The authors acknowledge that Auto-UI unified performs relatively inferior on certain subsets due to data imbalance. Future work could explore methods to mitigate this issue, possibly through advanced data augmentation or balancing techniques, to further improve performance across all domains.

3. **Comparison with More Baselines:** While the paper compares Auto-UI with several strong baselines, including LLMs and specialized UI agents, incorporating comparisons with other multimodal models or recent advancements in autonomous agents could provide a more comprehensive benchmarking.

4. **User Interaction Scenarios:** Extending the evaluation to include more dynamic user interaction scenarios, such as handling unexpected UI changes or multitasking, would demonstrate the model's robustness and adaptability in more complex environments.

*Conclusion:*
"You Only Look at Screens: Multimodal Chain-of-Action Agents" introduces a groundbreaking approach to autonomous UI control by eliminating the dependency on environment parsing and application-specific APIs. Auto-UI's integration of multimodal inputs and the chain-of-action technique results in superior performance and efficiency. Despite minor areas for enhancement, the paper makes significant contributions to the field of intelligent agents and paves the way for more adaptable and resource-efficient UI control systems. The inclusion of concepts like **"weak supervised learning"** could further enrich the discussion and highlight additional avenues for future research.
