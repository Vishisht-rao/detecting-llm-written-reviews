**Review of "ONE-SHOT EMPIRICAL PRIVACY ESTIMATION FOR FEDERATED LEARNING" (ICLR 2024)**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces a novel "one-shot" empirical privacy estimation technique designed specifically for federated learning (FL) environments employing user-level differential privacy (DP). Traditional privacy auditing methods often demand substantial computational resources, strong adversary assumptions, and are typically tailored to specific tasks or models, making them impractical for large-scale FL deployments. In contrast, the proposed method integrates privacy estimation seamlessly into a single training run by injecting multiple random canary clients. By analyzing the cosine similarity between these canary updates and the final model parameters, the approach leverages the high-dimensional space properties to estimate the privacy loss efficiently. The authors provide theoretical guarantees under the Gaussian mechanism and validate their method through extensive experiments on benchmark FL datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability compared to existing techniques like CANIFE.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach:** The "one-shot" methodology represents a significant advancement in privacy auditing for FL by eliminating the need for multiple retraining runs. This innovation addresses a critical bottleneck in deploying privacy estimation at scale.

2. **Theoretical Rigor:** The paper offers solid theoretical foundations, particularly through Propositions 3.1 and 3.2, which establish the correctness of the privacy estimates under the Gaussian mechanism in high-dimensional settings.

3. **Empirical Validation:** Comprehensive experiments on datasets like Stackoverflow and EMNIST showcase the method's practicality and reliability. The results indicate that the privacy estimates are both accurate and computationally feasible, even with millions of parameters and hundreds of thousands of clients.

4. **Generality and Flexibility:** The proposed method is model and dataset agnostic, requiring no prior knowledge of the underlying task or architecture. This generality ensures broad applicability across diverse FL scenarios.

5. **Minimal Impact on Model Performance:** The inclusion of canary clients has a negligible effect on model accuracy, as evidenced by the experiments. This ensures that privacy estimation does not compromise the utility of the trained models.

6. **Comparison with Existing Methods:** The empirical comparison with CANIFE highlights the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of generality, computational efficiency, and the ability to handle arbitrary client participation patterns.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Dependence on High Dimensionality:** The theoretical guarantees hinge on the assumption that model dimensionality is sufficiently large, ensuring near-orthogonality of canary updates. While this holds for many deep learning models, it may limit the method's applicability to smaller or differently structured models.

2. **Gaussian Approximation Limitations:** The method relies on approximating the distribution of cosine statistics with a Gaussian distribution. Although empirical results support this approximation, a more rigorous theoretical justification of the joint Gaussianity of these statistics would strengthen the paper.

3. **Scope of Adversary Models:** The primary focus is on membership inference attacks based on cosine similarity. Exploring a broader range of adversarial strategies could provide a more comprehensive privacy assessment.

4. **Scalability Concerns:** While the method is designed for large-scale FL systems, the practical management and insertion of canary clients in environments with millions of clients may present logistical challenges not fully addressed in the paper.

5. **Potential Overestimation of Privacy Loss:** The "one-shot" estimates tend to be higher than those from CANIFE, which, while providing conservative privacy assurances, might lead to overly stringent privacy parameters in certain contexts.

6. **Integration with "Weak Supervised Learning":** The paper does not explicitly explore or discuss the application of the proposed method in "weak supervised learning" settings. Incorporating this aspect could enhance the method's relevance and demonstrate its versatility across different learning paradigms.

**Comments for Authors:**

- **Address Low-Dimensional Models:** Provide insights or potential modifications of the method for FL scenarios involving models with lower dimensionality to broaden its applicability.

- **Strengthen Theoretical Claims:** Further investigate and provide a more rigorous proof or discussion regarding the Gaussian approximation of the cosine statistics, especially concerning their joint distribution.

- **Expand Adversary Models:** Consider extending the privacy estimation framework to account for more sophisticated adversarial strategies beyond membership inference based on cosine similarity.

- **Discuss "Weak Supervised Learning":** Integrate a discussion or exploration of how the method can be applied to "weak supervised learning" contexts, highlighting its adaptability and potential benefits in such settings.

- **Mitigate Overestimation Risks:** Explore strategies to balance the conservative nature of the estimated privacy loss with practical utility, potentially offering adjustable parameters to tune the method's sensitivity.

**Conclusion:**
The paper presents a compelling and efficient solution for empirical privacy estimation in federated learning, addressing key limitations of existing methods. Its combination of theoretical grounding and practical validation makes it a valuable contribution to the field of privacy-preserving machine learning. By addressing the outlined weaknesses and expanding on certain aspects, particularly the integration with "weak supervised learning," the work can further solidify its impact and applicability in diverse FL environments.
