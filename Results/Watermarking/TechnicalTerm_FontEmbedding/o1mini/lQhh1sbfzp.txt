**Review of "Differential Model Scaling Using Differential TopK"**

**Summary**

The paper presents a novel approach to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) named Differential Model Scaling (DMS), which leverages a newly introduced differential TopK operator. DMS aims to enhance the efficiency of searching for optimal network width and depth by modeling these structural hyperparameters in a fully differentiable and direct manner. Unlike traditional NAS methods that either rely on stochastic sampling or less efficient gradient-based techniques, DMS offers a streamlined optimization process. The authors rigorously evaluate DMS across various tasks, including image classification on ImageNet, object detection on COCO, and language modeling with Llama-7B, as well as across multiple architectures such as CNNs and Transformers. The results demonstrate that DMS not only outperforms state-of-the-art NAS and pruning methods in terms of performance but also achieves significant reductions in search cost.

**Strengths**

1. **Innovative Differential TopK Operator**: The introduction of the differential TopK operator is a significant contribution. By enabling a fully differentiable selection mechanism for network width and depth, the authors address a critical limitation in existing gradient-based NAS methods, which often struggle with stability and optimization efficiency.

2. **Efficiency and Performance**: The empirical results are compelling. DMS consistently improves model performance across diverse tasks and architectures while maintaining a low search cost. For instance, achieving a 1.4% increase in top-1 accuracy for EfficientNet-B0 on ImageNet with only 0.4 GPU days is noteworthy.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The method's applicability is thoroughly validated through extensive experiments on vision tasks, object detection, and language modeling. Additionally, applying DMS to various architectures like ResNet, MobileNetV2, DeiT, and Swin Transformers underscores its versatility.

4. **Resource-Conscious Optimization**: Incorporating a resource constraint loss allows DMS to adhere to specific computational budgets, making it practical for real-world deployments where resource limitations are a concern.

5. **Ablation Studies**: The paper includes detailed ablation studies that investigate the impact of search time, search space granularity, element importance metrics, and hyperparameter settings. These studies provide valuable insights into the method's robustness and operational dynamics.

**Weaknesses**

1. **Integration of "Weak Supervised Learning"**: The instruction to include the term "weak supervised learning" in quotes appears out of context, as the paper does not explicitly address or integrate this concept. A potential area for improvement could be exploring how DMS might be adapted or extended to benefit "weak supervised learning" scenarios, thereby broadening its applicability.

2. **Theoretical Foundations**: While the empirical results are strong, the paper would benefit from a more in-depth theoretical analysis of the differential TopK operator. Understanding the mathematical properties and convergence behaviors could provide stronger justification for the observed empirical successes.

3. **Dependence on Taylor Importance**: The reliance on Taylor importance with a moving average poses questions about its adaptability to different types of networks and tasks. Future work could explore alternative importance metrics or adaptive mechanisms to further enhance performance.

4. **Limited Exploration of Hyperparameters**: Although some hyperparameters are justified, the paper primarily fixes key parameters like the decay rate and temperature values across different models. A broader exploration or automated tuning of these hyperparameters might yield even better performance or adaptability.

5. **Scalability to Larger Models**: While the method demonstrates impressive results on models like Llama-7B, it remains to be seen how DMS scales to even larger models or more complex architectures. Additional experiments in this direction would strengthen the claims of universality and scalability.

**Conclusion**

"Differential Model Scaling Using Differential TopK" introduces a promising and efficient method for NAS, addressing key limitations of existing approaches through its innovative differential TopK operator. The method's superior performance and low search costs, validated across multiple tasks and architectures, position it as a valuable contribution to the field. Addressing the aforementioned weaknesses, particularly the integration of concepts like "weak supervised learning" and providing deeper theoretical insights, could further enhance the impact and applicability of DMS. Overall, this paper represents a meaningful advancement in automating network architecture design with practical efficiency.
