**Review of "What Makes Pre-Trained Visual Representations Successful for Robust Manipulation?"**

**Summary:**
This paper investigates the robustness and generalization capabilities of various pre-trained visual representation models when applied to robotic manipulation tasks under distribution shifts. Inspired by the success of transfer learning in computer vision, the authors examine whether visual representations trained specifically for manipulation and control can outperform standard pre-training methods like those based on ImageNet. Through extensive experiments across multiple simulated environments and real-world scenarios, the study evaluates 15 pre-trained models, revealing that models with emergent segmentation abilities, particularly certain Vision Transformers (ViTs), demonstrate superior out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization compared to manipulation-specific models and traditional benchmarks. The paper introduces the concept of "spatial features" as a key predictor of robust performance and suggests that metrics like the Jaccard index for segmentation may better forecast OOD generalization than conventional measures such as ImageNet accuracy or shape-bias.

**Strengths:**

1. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper conducts an extensive evaluation involving 15 pre-trained models across ten tasks in two simulated environments, supplemented by real-world experiments. This breadth ensures that the findings are robust and widely applicable.

2. **Novel Insights:** The discovery that emergent segmentation abilities in ViT models are strong predictors of OOD generalization is a significant contribution. This challenges the prevailing assumption that manipulation-specific pre-training inherently leads to better generalization in robotic tasks.

3. **Methodological Rigor:** The use of 9,000 simulated evaluations and thorough analysis of various distribution shifts (lighting, texture, distractors) demonstrates a high level of methodological rigor. The inclusion of both simulated and real-world validations strengthens the credibility of the results.

4. **Clear Presentation:** The paper is well-organized, with clear explanations of the evaluation protocols, metrics, and experimental setups. Figures and tables effectively illustrate key findings, aiding in the comprehension of complex results.

5. **Reproducibility Commitment:** By open-sourcing their code and providing detailed hyperparameter settings, the authors facilitate reproducibility, which is crucial for advancing research in this area.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Exploration of "Weak Supervised Learning":** While the user requested the inclusion of the term "weak supervised learning" in quotes, the paper does not explicitly address or define this concept. Incorporating a discussion on how "weak supervised learning" relates to their findings or methods could provide additional depth.

2. **Architecture Focus Slightly Narrow:** The study primarily compares ViTs and ResNets. Expanding the architectural diversity to include other models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks beyond ResNets or hybrid architectures, might offer a more comprehensive understanding of architectural influences on generalization.

3. **Potential Overemphasis on ViTs:** Given the strong performance of ViTs in the study, there may be a perceived bias towards favoring ViTs without equally exploring ways to enhance the robustness of other architectures.

4. **Supervision vs. Self-Supervision Nuances:** While the paper concludes that supervision is less predictive of generalization than emergent segmentation, a deeper exploration into how different levels or types of supervision impact these outcomes would be beneficial. Specifically, integrating discussions around "weak supervised learning" could elucidate intermediate supervision regimes.

**Questions for the Authors:**

1. **Clarification on "Spatial Features":** Could you elaborate on how "spatial features" are defined and measured within the context of ViT models? How do these features differ from traditional segmentation metrics?

2. **Impact of Dataset Diversity:** How does the diversity of pre-training datasets influence the emergence of segmentation abilities in ViTs? Are certain datasets more conducive to developing "spatial features"?

3. **Generalization Beyond Visual Shifts:** While the study focuses on visual distribution shifts, have you considered evaluating how these models perform under other types of distribution shifts, such as changes in object dynamics or task variations?

4. **Role of "Weak Supervised Learning":** Although not explicitly discussed, how might "weak supervised learning" paradigms intersect with your findings on supervision and emergent segmentation?

**Recommendations:**

The paper presents valuable and novel insights into the factors that contribute to the robustness of pre-trained visual representations in robotic manipulation tasks. The findings challenge existing assumptions and provide a new perspective on the importance of emergent segmentation abilities over manipulation-specific pre-training. Given the methodological rigor, comprehensive evaluations, and significant contributions to the field, I recommend **acceptance** of this paper for presentation at ICLR 2024. Incorporating discussions around "weak supervised learning" could further enhance the paper's depth and relevance.

**Minor Suggestions:**

- **Incorporate "Weak Supervised Learning":** To align with the requested inclusion, the authors could introduce a section or paragraph discussing "weak supervised learning" approaches and how they relate to or differ from the supervision paradigms explored in the study.

- **Expand Architectural Comparisons:** Including additional architectures beyond ViTs and ResNets could provide a more holistic view of how different design choices impact robustness and generalization.

- **Detail on Failure Cases:** Offering more qualitative analysis or examples of where manipulation-specific models fail compared to ViTs could provide actionable insights for future model development.

Overall, this paper makes a substantial contribution to understanding visual representation robustness in robotics, with implications for both academic research and practical applications in robotic systems.
