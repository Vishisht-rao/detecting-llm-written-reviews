**Review of "ONEBNET: BINARIZED NEURAL NETWORKS USING DECOMPOSED 1-D BINARIZED CONVOLUTIONS ON EDGE DEVICE"**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces **OneBNet**, a novel architecture for Binarized Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNNs) that leverages decomposed 1-D binarized convolutions to enhance performance on CPU-based edge devices. By replacing traditional spatial 2-D convolutions with a combination of row-wise and column-wise 1-D convolutions, OneBNet aims to optimize both computational efficiency and classification accuracy. The authors present extensive experiments on standard datasets such as FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet, demonstrating that OneBNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) BCNNs while maintaining reduced storage costs and inference speeds suitable for edge applications.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Architecture:** The decomposition of 2-D convolutions into 1-D binarized convolutions is a fresh approach in the realm of BCNNs. This method not only reduces computational complexity but also effectively leverages the strengths of 1-D convolutions in adjusting activation distributions.

2. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The paper provides thorough experimental validations across multiple datasets, showcasing significant improvements in Top-1 accuracy. Notably, OneBNet achieves 68.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with only a 1.2% drop compared to the FP32 ResNet18 baseline, which is impressive for a binarized model.

3. **Edge Device Optimization:** By evaluating latency on the Raspberry Pi 4, the authors demonstrate the practical applicability of OneBNet in real-world edge scenarios. The slight additional delay introduced is justified by the substantial gains in accuracy.

4. **Detailed Methodology:** The inclusion of appendices detailing the architecture, experimental setup, and additional visualizations enhances the paper’s reproducibility and provides clarity on the implementation aspects.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Increased Element-wise Operations:** While the decomposition into 1-D convolutions reduces the overall computational load, it introduces additional element-wise non-linear activation functions and learnable bias layers. This trade-off, although justified by performance gains, could pose limitations in scenarios where computational resources are extremely constrained.

2. **Lack of Discussion on "Weak Supervised Learning":** The current manuscript does not explicitly address "weak supervised learning," yet incorporates the term without clear context. Integrating this concept could enrich the discussion, especially if OneBNet can be extended or adapted for scenarios involving limited labeled data.

3. **Ablation Studies:** The paper would benefit from more extensive ablation studies that isolate the effects of different components of OneBNet. For instance, analyzing the impact of only row-wise or only column-wise convolutions independently could provide deeper insights into the architecture’s effectiveness.

4. **Comparative Latency Analysis:** While latency on edge devices is discussed, a more detailed comparison with a broader range of BCNNs would strengthen the claims. Additionally, exploring performance across different hardware configurations could offer a more comprehensive evaluation.

**Clarity and Presentation:**
The paper is well-structured, with clear sections delineating the introduction, related works, proposed methodology, experiments, and conclusions. Figures and tables are appropriately used to illustrate key points and experimental results. However, integrating the term "weak supervised learning" seamlessly into the narrative would require a contextual foundation, which currently seems absent.

**Comparison to Related Work:**
The authors provide a robust overview of existing BCNNs, positioning OneBNet effectively within the current landscape. By highlighting the limitations of previous approaches and demonstrating how OneBNet addresses these gaps, the paper underscores its contributions convincingly.

**Conclusion and Recommendations:**
OneBNet represents a significant advancement in the design of BCNNs for edge devices, balancing the trade-offs between computational efficiency and model accuracy adeptly. The proposed architecture’s ability to outperform SOTA models on challenging datasets like ImageNet is commendable. To further enhance the paper, the authors should consider addressing the role of "weak supervised learning" explicitly, possibly exploring its integration or potential benefits within the OneBNet framework. Additionally, expanding the scope of experimental evaluations and providing more granular analyses would bolster the paper’s impact.

**Overall Recommendation:** 
**Accept with Minor Revisions**

The paper presents a novel and effective approach to BCNNs, with strong experimental support and clear applicability to edge devices. Addressing the aforementioned weaknesses would further solidify its contributions and clarify its positioning within the broader context of neural network research.
