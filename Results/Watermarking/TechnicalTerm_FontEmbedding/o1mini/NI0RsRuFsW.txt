**Review of "How Hard Is Trojan Detection in DNNs? Fooling Detectors with Evasive Trojans"**

**Summary:**
The paper titled "How Hard Is Trojan Detection in DNNs? Fooling Detectors with Evasive Trojans" presents a novel approach to enhancing the stealthiness of trojan attacks in deep neural networks (DNNs). The authors introduce a method that employs a distribution matching loss inspired by the 1-Wasserstein distance, complemented by specificity and randomization losses, to create "evasive trojans." These trojans are designed to significantly reduce the effectiveness of a wide range of existing detection mechanisms across multiple datasets while maintaining high attack success rates. Extensive experiments involving over 6,000 neural networks across datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and GTSRB demonstrate the method's efficacy. Additionally, the study reveals that these evasive trojans are unexpectedly more challenging to reverse-engineer, highlighting deeper vulnerabilities in current trojan detection and mitigation strategies.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Methodology:** The proposed approach for crafting evasive trojans is both creative and methodologically sound. By integrating distribution matching with specificity and randomization losses, the authors address multiple facets of evasion, making the trojans robust against diverse detection techniques.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper conducts extensive experiments, training over 6,000 neural networks and evaluating them against eight different detectors. This breadth ensures that the findings are robust and generalizable across various scenarios and detection methods.

3. **Robustness Across Datasets and Attacks:** The method's effectiveness is demonstrated across multiple datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, GTSRB) and attack types (Patch and Blended attacks). This versatility underscores the practical applicability of the approach.

4. **Surprising Insight on Reverse Engineering:** The discovery that evasive trojans are harder to reverse-engineer than standard trojans is both unexpected and significant. This insight adds a new dimension to the understanding of trojan vulnerabilities and challenges existing defense mechanisms.

5. **Reproducibility Commitment:** The authors mention the availability of experiment code and models (anonymized for review), promoting transparency and enabling future research to build upon their work.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Exploration of "Weak Supervised Learning":** While the user requested the inclusion of the term "weak supervised learning" in the review, the paper does not explicitly address or incorporate weak supervised learning techniques. Exploring connections or distinctions between their method and weak supervised learning could provide additional depth to the analysis.

2. **Dependence on Specific Metrics:** The primary evaluation metric used is AUROC, which, while standard, may not capture all nuances of detection performance. Incorporating additional metrics or qualitative assessments could offer a more holistic view of the method's effectiveness.

3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The paper outlines various hyperparameters for different datasets and attack types. However, a more detailed analysis of how sensitive the results are to these hyperparameter choices would enhance the understanding of the method's robustness and ease of adoption.

4. **Comparison with Emerging Attacks:** Although the paper compares its method against established detectors, it could benefit from a comparison with the latest evasion techniques in the literature to position its contributions more clearly within the current research landscape.

5. **Scope of Network Architectures:** The focus is primarily on classification networks. Extending the evaluation to other network architectures, such as regression or generative models, could broaden the applicability and impact of the findings.

**Recommendation:**
The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of neural network security by introducing a method that effectively creates evasive trojans resistant to a wide array of detection mechanisms. The comprehensive experimental evaluation and the novel insight into the difficulties of reverse-engineering these trojans are particularly noteworthy. To further strengthen the paper, the authors could explore connections to "weak supervised learning" techniques, provide a deeper analysis of hyperparameter sensitivities, and expand comparisons to include the latest evasion methods. Addressing these areas would enhance the clarity and depth of the study, making it a more robust reference for future research in trojan detection and mitigation.

**Overall Evaluation:**
The paper is well-executed, with innovative methodologies and thorough evaluations that advance the understanding of trojan evasion in deep neural networks. It is recommended for acceptance, contingent upon minor revisions to address the highlighted weaknesses.
