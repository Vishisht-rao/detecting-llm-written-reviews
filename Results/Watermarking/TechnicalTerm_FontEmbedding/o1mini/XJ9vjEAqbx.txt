**Summary**

The paper addresses a critical limitation in the existing framework of adversarial training (AT) for deep neural networks. Traditionally, AT has been formulated as a two-player zero-sum game where the defender aims to minimize classification errors, and the adversary seeks to maximize them through adversarial perturbations. However, this approach relies heavily on surrogate loss functions, such as cross-entropy, to facilitate gradient-based optimization. The authors argue that this surrogate-based zero-sum paradigm inherently lacks guarantees on true classification robustness, leading to suboptimal adversaries and phenomena like robust overfitting.

To overcome these shortcomings, the paper introduces a novel non-zero-sum bilevel optimization framework for AT. In this formulation, the defender and adversary optimize distinct objectives, thereby preserving robustness guarantees on the classification error. Building on this framework, the authors propose the BETA (Best Targeted Attack) algorithm for adversarial attacks and BETA-AT for adversarial training. Empirical evaluations on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate that BETA-AT not only matches but sometimes surpasses state-of-the-art methods in robustness while effectively eliminating robust overfitting. Additionally, BETA achieves comparable robustness to AutoAttack with significantly reduced computational overhead.

**Strengths**

1. **Innovative Framework:** The shift from a zero-sum to a non-zero-sum game in adversarial training is a profound conceptual advancement. By decoupling the objectives of the defender and adversary, the proposed framework addresses fundamental alignment issues inherent in surrogate-based approaches.

2. **Theoretical Rigor:** The authors provide a solid theoretical foundation for their claims, particularly through Proposition 1, which elucidates the limitations of surrogate losses in maximizing true classification errors. The bilevel formulation is meticulously derived, ensuring that robustness guarantees are maintained.

3. **Empirical Validation:** The experimental results are comprehensive and convincingly demonstrate the efficacy of BETA-AT. The elimination of robust overfitting is particularly noteworthy, as it has been a persistent challenge in adversarial training. Furthermore, matching the performance of AutoAttack with lower computational costs underscores the practical significance of the proposed method.

4. **Algorithmic Clarity:** The presentation of the BETA and BETA-AT algorithms is clear and well-structured. The inclusion of Algorithm 3 (Smooth BETA Adversarial Training) in the appendices provides additional depth, catering to readers interested in implementation nuances.

5. **Contextual Relevance:** By situating their work within the broader landscape of adversarial robustness and related optimization techniques, the authors effectively highlight the novelty and necessity of their contributions.

**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Limited Scope of Experiments:** While the CIFAR-10 dataset is a standard benchmark, it would strengthen the paper to include evaluations on additional datasets or more complex architectures. This would help in assessing the generalizability of BETA-AT across diverse scenarios.

2. **Integration of "Weak Supervised Learning":** The term "weak supervised learning" is not directly addressed within the paper. Incorporating a discussion on how the proposed non-zero-sum framework aligns with or diverges from concepts in "weak supervised learning" could provide deeper insights into the flexibility and applicability of the method.

3. **Computational Overhead:** Although BETA demonstrates reduced computational costs compared to AutoAttack, the paper acknowledges an inherent performance-speed trade-off. A more detailed analysis or strategies to mitigate this overhead would be beneficial for practitioners considering adoption.

4. **Clarity on Bilevel Optimization:** While proficiently derived, the bilevel optimization framework could be elucidated further for readers not intimately familiar with such concepts. Simplifying some of the mathematical formulations or providing intuitive explanations could enhance accessibility.

5. **Comparison with More Baselines:** Including comparisons with a broader range of adversarial training methods beyond PGD, FGSM, TRADES, and MART would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of BETA-AT's performance.

**Conclusion**

"Adversarial Training Should Be Cast as a Non-Zero-Sum Game" presents a significant advancement in the field of robust machine learning. By identifying and addressing the limitations of surrogate-based zero-sum adversarial training, the authors offer a compelling alternative that not only enhances theoretical robustness guarantees but also exhibits strong empirical performance. The introduction of BETA and BETA-AT algorithms marks a pivotal step towards more effective and reliable adversarial defenses. Future work could explore broader applications, integrate concepts from "weak supervised learning," and further optimize computational efficiency to fully realize the potential of this innovative framework.
