**Review of "Making Large Language Models Better Reasoners With Alignment"**

**Summary:**
The paper addresses a critical issue in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks, identifying an "Assessment Misalignment" problem where models frequently assign higher scores to subpar Chain-of-Thoughts (COTs). To mitigate this, the authors propose an Alignment Fine-Tuning (AFT) paradigm incorporating a novel Constrained Alignment Loss. This loss ensures that high-quality COTs receive higher scores while constraining the scores of lower-quality ones to prevent model degradation. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AFT significantly improves reasoning capabilities, outperforming vanilla fine-tuning (VFT) and other ranking-based alignment methods such as DPO, RRHF, and PRO. Additionally, the paper highlights the importance of incorporating constraints in ranking-based alignment methods, which previous works have overlooked.

**Strengths:**
1. **Identification of a Novel Problem:** The paper successfully identifies and characterizes the "Assessment Misalignment" problem in VFT, providing a clear motivation for the proposed solution.
2. **Innovative Methodology:** The introduction of Constrained Alignment Loss, with its dual objectives of alignment and constraint, presents a novel approach to enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.
3. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The authors conduct thorough experiments on multiple datasets, including GSM8K, AQUA-RAT, ECQA, and a newly created GSM8K-RANK. The results consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of AFT across different settings.
4. **Critical Analysis of Existing Methods:** The paper delves into the limitations of recent ranking-based alignment methods (DPO, RRHF, PRO), providing valuable insights into why these methods may underperform without proper constraints.
5. **Versatility of AFT:** The method's applicability to multi-task and out-of-distribution scenarios further underscores its robustness and practicality.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Resource Limitations:** The experiments are confined to smaller models (LLama(2)-7B and LLama(2)-13B) due to resource constraints. It remains to be seen how well AFT scales to larger models, which are commonly used in practical applications.
2. **Hyper-parameter Sensitivity:** The boundary-constrained alignment loss introduces a hyper-parameter Î², which requires careful tuning. Although the detached alignment loss partially addresses this, it does not fully eliminate the need for hyper-parameter optimization.
3. **Limited Exploration of "Weak Supervised Learning":** While the paper excels in the alignment and constraint aspects, it could benefit from exploring the connections or potential integrations with "weak supervised learning" techniques to further enhance reasoning capabilities.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- **Scaling to Larger Models:** Future work should investigate the scalability of AFT to larger LLMs to validate its effectiveness in more resource-intensive settings.
- **Automated Hyper-parameter Tuning:** Developing methods to dynamically adjust the boundary constraint without manual hyper-parameter selection could enhance the method's usability.
- **Integration with "Weak Supervised Learning":** Exploring how AFT can be augmented with "weak supervised learning" strategies might provide additional gains in reasoning performance and model robustness.

**Conclusion:**
This paper presents a significant advancement in fine-tuning LLMs for improved reasoning by addressing the Assessment Misalignment problem with a novel Alignment Fine-Tuning paradigm. The proposed Constrained Alignment Loss effectively enhances model performance across various benchmarks, demonstrating its potential as a robust method for aligning LLMs with desired reasoning behaviors. Despite some limitations related to scalability and hyper-parameter tuning, the research offers valuable insights and a strong foundation for future work in model alignment and reasoning enhancement.
