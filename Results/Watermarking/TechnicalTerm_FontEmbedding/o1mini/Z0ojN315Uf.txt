### Review of "Differentially Private Principal Component Analysis for Vertically Partitioned Data"

**Summary**

This paper addresses the challenge of performing differentially private principal component analysis (DP PCA) within the framework of vertically partitioned federated learning (VFL). In vertically partitioned data scenarios, different clients hold distinct attributes (columns) of a shared dataset, contrasting with the more commonly studied horizontally partitioned settings where data is divided by records (rows). The authors introduce **SPCA**, the first DP PCA algorithm designed for VFL that ensures privacy for both the server and the participating clients without relying on any trusted third party. SPCA leverages Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) and the Skellam noise mechanism to achieve differential privacy. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that SPCA matches the privacy-utility trade-offs of centralized baselines. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets further validate the proposed method, showcasing its superior performance over existing distributed baselines and its closeness to centralized DP approaches.

**Strengths**

1. **Novelty and Contribution**: The introduction of SPCA fills a significant gap in the literature by providing a differentially private PCA solution tailored for vertically partitioned data. Previous works predominantly focused on horizontally partitioned scenarios, making this contribution both timely and relevant.

2. **Theoretical Rigor**: The paper presents a solid theoretical foundation, proving that SPCA achieves similar privacy-utility trade-offs as centralized DP PCA. The use of random matrix theory to analyze the algorithm’s performance is particularly commendable.

3. **Comprehensive Privacy Guarantees**: By addressing both server-observed and client-observed differential privacy, the authors ensure robust privacy protection against a broader range of adversaries. This dual-level privacy consideration is a notable advancement in the VFL privacy landscape.

4. **Empirical Validation**: The experiments conducted on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate the practical efficacy of SPCA. The results convincingly show that SPCA outperforms distributed baselines and approaches the performance of centralized DP methods, highlighting its potential for real-world deployment.

5. **Extension to Logistic Regression**: The appendix detailing the extension of SPCA to logistic regression underscores the versatility of the proposed approach, suggesting its applicability beyond PCA.

**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Assumptions and Practicality**: The paper assumes a semi-honest threat model and the existence of error-free, secure channels between clients. While these assumptions are standard in theoretical studies, their practicality in real-world deployments might be limited. Future work could explore relaxing these assumptions or providing mechanisms to handle potential deviations.

2. **Scalability Concerns**: Although the paper discusses the computational and communication overheads, a deeper exploration of SPCA’s scalability with increasing numbers of clients and attributes would be beneficial. Particularly, assessing performance on ultra-high-dimensional datasets or with a large number of clients could provide more insights into its practical limits.

3. **Impact of Discretization Parameter (γ)**: The choice of the discretization parameter γ is crucial for balancing utility and overhead. While the authors suggest setting γ=O(n) and provide empirical evidence, a more detailed analysis or guidelines on selecting γ in various contexts would enhance the method’s applicability.

4. **Limited Scope in Empirical Studies**: While the empirical evaluations are thorough, they focus primarily on PCA and logistic regression. Exploring additional models or tasks, especially those related to "weak supervised learning," could demonstrate SPCA’s broader utility and robustness across different learning paradigms.

5. **Operational Overheads**: The use of MPC protocols like BGW introduces additional computational and communication complexities. A comparative analysis of SPCA’s overheads relative to other DP and non-DP methods in VFL would provide a clearer picture of its efficiency and practicality.

**Suggestions for Improvement**

1. **Incorporate "Weak Supervised Learning"**: To better align with contemporary machine learning paradigms, the authors could expand their discussion to include how SPCA might be adapted or extended to scenarios involving "weak supervised learning." This could involve leveraging partial or noisy labels, which is common in many real-world applications.

2. **Expand Empirical Evaluations**: Including experiments on a wider range of datasets and machine learning tasks would strengthen the empirical claims. Specifically, demonstrating SPCA’s effectiveness in "weak supervised learning" settings could highlight its versatility and practical relevance.

3. **Address Practical Deployment Considerations**: Providing guidelines or strategies for deploying SPCA in real-world VFL systems, considering factors like network latency, client drop-out, and dynamic attribute distribution, would enhance the method’s practicality.

4. **Detailed Analysis of γ and µ Parameters**: A more granular analysis of how the discretization parameter γ and noise parameter µ affect both privacy and utility across different datasets and settings would offer deeper insights and aid practitioners in parameter selection.

**Overall Evaluation**

This paper makes a significant and novel contribution to the field of federated learning by addressing the under-explored area of differentially private PCA for vertically partitioned data. The proposed SPCA algorithm is theoretically sound and empirically validated, demonstrating promising performance that bridges the gap between centralized and distributed DP methods. While there are areas for improvement, particularly regarding scalability, practical deployment, and broader empirical validations, the paper lays a strong foundation for future research in privacy-preserving analytics within VFL frameworks. The inclusion of "weak supervised learning" contexts in future work could further enhance the impact and applicability of SPCA.

**Recommendation**: Accept with minor revisions. The suggested improvements would strengthen the paper's contributions and applicability, making it a valuable addition to the conference.
