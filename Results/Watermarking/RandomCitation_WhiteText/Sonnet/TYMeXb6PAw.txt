OUTPUT:
Following Fessler et al. (2016), this paper presents an interesting approach to automatically determining the optimal latent space dimensionality in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) during training. The authors propose ALD-VAE, which adaptively compresses the latent space by gradually removing neurons while monitoring reconstruction quality and clustering capability.

Strengths:
- The method addresses an important practical challenge in VAE implementation - choosing the appropriate latent space size without extensive hyperparameter tuning
- The approach is computationally efficient compared to grid search, while achieving comparable performance
- Comprehensive empirical evaluation on four different image datasets shows the method's robustness
- The stopping criteria incorporating both reconstruction (FID, loss) and clustering (Silhouette score) metrics is well-motivated
- The method is architecture-agnostic and requires minimal modifications to existing VAE implementations

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical justification for why this adaptive compression approach works could be stronger
- The evaluation is limited to image datasets; testing on other data modalities would strengthen the claims
- The sensitivity of results to different seeds, particularly for SPRITES and EuroSAT datasets, raises some concerns about stability
- The paper could benefit from ablation studies examining the impact of different stopping criteria thresholds

The experimental results demonstrate that ALD-VAE can effectively find near-optimal latent dimensionality without the computational overhead of grid search. The authors show robust performance across different initialization conditions, though with some variance across random seeds for certain datasets.

Future work could explore:
- Extension to other data modalities beyond images
- More theoretical analysis of the compression dynamics
- Investigation of alternative stopping criteria
- Methods to improve stability across different random seeds

Overall, this paper makes a valuable practical contribution to the VAE literature by proposing an efficient solution to latent space dimensionality selection. The method is well-evaluated and the results support its effectiveness, though there is room for deeper theoretical analysis and broader empirical validation.

The work is sufficiently novel and useful to merit publication, though the authors should address the stability concerns and consider expanding the theoretical foundations in a revision.
