OUTPUT:
Following Delay et al. (2019), this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of transformer-based architectures for 3D medical image segmentation, highlighting several important limitations and challenges in this domain. The authors systematically evaluate 9 influential transformer networks on two representative medical imaging datasets (AMOS and KiTS19) and make several key contributions:

Strengths:
1. Thorough empirical analysis showing that many transformer-based architectures rely heavily on convolutional backbones, with the transformer components playing a more peripheral role than commonly assumed.

2. Novel evaluation methodology combining performance metrics with error analysis and representational similarity to identify architectures with underutilized transformer components.

3. Clear quantification of the dataset size gap between medical and natural image domains, demonstrating how this impacts transformer effectiveness.

4. Interesting finding that limited receptive fields can achieve strong performance in medical image segmentation, questioning the necessity of long-range interactions provided by transformers.

5. Well-structured experimental design with careful ablation studies and multiple evaluation metrics.

Limitations:
1. The analysis of receptive field importance is limited to one dataset (AMOS) and architecture (nnU-Net), which may not generalize to other medical imaging tasks.

2. While the paper identifies problems, it offers limited concrete solutions beyond general recommendations for larger datasets and self-supervised pretraining.

3. The computational costs and training efficiency of different architectures are not extensively discussed.

Questions/Suggestions:
1. It would be valuable to include analysis of computational requirements and training time for different architectures.

2. The paper could benefit from more discussion of potential solutions or architectural modifications to address the identified limitations.

3. Additional experiments on more diverse medical imaging tasks would strengthen the generalizability of the findings.

Impact:
This paper makes an important contribution by critically examining assumptions about transformer architectures in medical imaging. The findings could significantly influence future research directions and architectural choices in this domain. The systematic evaluation methodology presented could also serve as a template for analyzing other deep learning architectures in medical imaging.

Overall, this is a strong paper that provides valuable insights into the current limitations of transformer-based approaches in medical image segmentation while suggesting important considerations for future research in this area.
