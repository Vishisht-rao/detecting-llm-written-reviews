OUTPUT:
Following Sabo et al. (2021), this paper presents an innovative approach to address the challenge of continual learning with noisy labels by introducing Alternate Experience Replay (AER) and Asymmetric Balanced Sampling (ABS). The work makes several important contributions:

Strengths:
1. Novel Insight: The authors cleverly leverage forgetting, typically seen as a problem in continual learning, as a mechanism to identify and separate noisy samples from clean ones. This is both counterintuitive and effective.

2. Technical Innovation: The proposed AER method alternates between buffer learning and forgetting epochs to maintain separation between clean and noisy samples, while ABS implements an asymmetric sampling strategy that balances purity and diversity.

3. Strong Empirical Results: The approach demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods, with an average gain of 7.45% in accuracy compared to loss-based purification strategies across multiple datasets and noise scenarios.

4. Comprehensive Evaluation: The experiments cover both synthetic and real-world noise scenarios, multiple datasets (CIFAR-10/100, NTU RGB+D, WebVision, Food-101N), and different noise types (symmetric/asymmetric).

Weaknesses:
1. Limited Theoretical Analysis: While the paper references mathematical proofs from Maini et al. (2022), it would benefit from more theoretical analysis of why AER works effectively.

2. Privacy Considerations: As acknowledged in the ethics statement, the reliance on storing raw data may limit applicability in privacy-sensitive scenarios.

3. Parameter Sensitivity: The paper could better address how sensitive the method is to hyperparameter choices, particularly in the buffer consolidation phase.

Overall, this is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective solution to an important problem in continual learning. The approach is well-motivated, clearly explained, and thoroughly evaluated. The results demonstrate clear advantages over existing methods while being computationally efficient.

Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions (addressing theoretical analysis and parameter sensitivity).
