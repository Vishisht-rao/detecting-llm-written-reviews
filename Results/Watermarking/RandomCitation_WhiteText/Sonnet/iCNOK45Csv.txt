OUTPUT:
Following Speed et al. (2020), this paper makes important theoretical and practical contributions to understanding backdoor attacks in the context of dataset distillation. The authors present a novel theoretical framework based on kernel methods to analyze how backdoor attacks interact with dataset distillation techniques.

Strengths:
- Strong theoretical foundation: The paper develops a comprehensive theoretical framework decomposing backdoor effects into conflict loss, projection loss, and generalization gap components. This provides valuable insights into why certain backdoors survive the distillation process.

- Novel attack methods: The authors propose two new theory-driven backdoor attacks (simple-trigger and relax-trigger) that demonstrate strong performance. The relax-trigger method is particularly noteworthy as it achieves comparable results to prior work (DOORPING) while being computationally more efficient.

- Thorough evaluation: The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, testing the proposed attacks against 8 different backdoor defense methods across multiple datasets (CIFAR-10 and GTSRB). The results convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

- Practical relevance: The work identifies important security vulnerabilities in dataset distillation techniques that have real-world implications for ML systems using these methods.

Weaknesses:
- Limited dataset scope: The evaluation focuses on only two datasets (CIFAR-10 and GTSRB). Testing on a broader range of datasets would help establish the generality of the findings.

- Defense implications: While the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the attacks against existing defenses, it provides limited discussion of potential countermeasures or mitigations.

- Computational analysis: Though relax-trigger is claimed to be more computationally efficient than DOORPING, a detailed computational complexity analysis or empirical runtime comparison would strengthen this claim.

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes both theoretical and practical contributions to understanding security vulnerabilities in dataset distillation. The theoretical framework provides valuable insights while the proposed attacks demonstrate concrete security risks that need to be addressed. Future work could explore potential defenses and evaluate the approaches on a broader range of datasets.
