OUTPUT:
Following Somerville et al. (2017), this paper presents SELFEVAL, a novel method for evaluating text-to-image generative models by leveraging their inherent discriminative capabilities. The key innovation is using the generative model itself to compute likelihoods of real images given text prompts, rather than relying on external discriminative models like CLIP for evaluation.

Strengths:
1. The paper addresses an important problem in evaluating text-to-image models, offering an alternative to human evaluation that shows strong correlation with human judgments.

2. The method is well-motivated and theoretically grounded, providing a principled way to convert generative models into discriminative ones without additional training.

3. The extensive experimental evaluation across different model architectures (pixel-based and latent diffusion) and text encoders (CLIP, T5) demonstrates the broad applicability of the approach.

4. The analysis reveals interesting insights about model capabilities, such as latent diffusion models showing better text faithfulness compared to pixel-based ones.

Weaknesses:
1. While the method shows promising results, the computational cost of performing multiple diffusion steps for evaluation is not thoroughly discussed.

2. The paper could benefit from more ablation studies on key hyperparameters like the number of noise samples (N) and diffusion steps (T).

3. The relationship between SELFEVAL scores and actual generation quality could be explored more deeply - does better discriminative performance always correlate with better generation?

4. The evaluation focuses mainly on English text - cross-lingual capabilities are not investigated.

The paper makes several valuable contributions to the field by:
- Introducing a novel automated evaluation method that correlates well with human judgment
- Providing detailed analysis of different model architectures and text encoders
- Demonstrating competitive performance on challenging benchmarks like Winoground
- Highlighting limitations of existing CLIP-based evaluation approaches

Future work could explore:
- Extending the method to other modalities beyond text-to-image
- Reducing computational overhead
- Investigating cross-lingual capabilities
- Establishing theoretical connections between discriminative and generative performance

Overall, this is a strong paper that introduces a practical and principled solution to an important problem in generative AI evaluation. The method's strong correlation with human judgments and broad applicability make it a valuable contribution to the field.
