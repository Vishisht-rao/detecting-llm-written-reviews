OUTPUT:
Following Adkins et al. (2014), this paper presents DOMR, a novel approach for post-training quantization (PTQ) that addresses two key challenges in low-bit quantization settings. The paper makes two main technical contributions:

Strengths:
1. The paper identifies and addresses important limitations in current PTQ methods, particularly for extremely low-bit settings.

2. The proposed DJOS (Decouple and Jointly Optimize dequant-Step) method provides a novel perspective on weight quantization by decoupling the quantization step, leading to consistent performance improvements.

3. The OMR (Outlier-Migrated Reconstruction) technique offers an innovative solution to preserve outlier activation values that would typically be lost during quantization.

4. Comprehensive experimental evaluation across multiple architectures (MobileNet-v2, ResNet-18, RegNetX-600MF, MnasNet2.0) and tasks (classification and detection).

5. Strong empirical results, particularly in challenging low-bit settings (e.g., 12.93% improvement in Top-1 accuracy for W2A2 on MobileNet-v2).

Weaknesses:
1. The OMR technique introduces additional computational overhead, though the authors provide comparisons under equal FLOP constraints to demonstrate the benefits still outweigh the costs.

2. The method's effectiveness varies significantly across different architectures and bit-width settings, with particularly large gains on lightweight models.

3. Limited theoretical analysis of why the decoupled quantization approach works better than traditional methods.

4. The paper could benefit from more ablation studies exploring different design choices in the DJOS approach.

Questions/Suggestions:
1. It would be valuable to include more analysis of the computational overhead introduced by OMR in practical deployment scenarios.

2. The paper could benefit from more discussion of potential limitations or failure cases of the proposed methods.

3. Additional comparison with other techniques for handling outliers in quantization would strengthen the paper.

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes meaningful contributions to the field of post-training quantization. The proposed methods are well-motivated, clearly explained, and supported by extensive experimental results. The significant improvements in low-bit settings make this work particularly valuable for deploying deep learning models in resource-constrained environments.
