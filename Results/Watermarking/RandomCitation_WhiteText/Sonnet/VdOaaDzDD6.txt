OUTPUT:
Following Baker et al. (2015), this paper introduces an interesting new variant of the multi-armed bandit problem called "bandits with ranking feedback," where instead of receiving numerical rewards, the learner only observes rankings of the arms based on their empirical means. This is an important contribution as it addresses scenarios where precise numerical feedback may be unavailable or unreliable, such as human preferences in matchmaking or private revenue data in advertising.

Strengths:
1. The theoretical analysis is thorough, providing both lower and upper bounds for the stochastic setting
2. The authors propose two novel algorithms - DREE for instance-dependent cases and R-LPE for instance-independent cases
3. The impossibility result showing no algorithm can be optimal for both instance-dependent and independent cases is insightful
4. The experimental evaluation comprehensively compares the proposed algorithms against baselines
5. The practical applications and motivation are well-justified

Weaknesses:
1. The proof techniques could be explained more intuitively, especially for the adversarial setting results
2. The experimental section could benefit from more ablation studies
3. The comparison with dueling bandits could be expanded given the similarities

The main technical contributions are:
- Proving that logarithmic regret is impossible in the instance-dependent case, unlike standard bandits
- Developing DREE algorithm with superlogarithmic regret matching the lower bound
- Designing R-LPE algorithm achieving O(âˆšT) regret in the instance-independent case
- Showing impossibility of sublinear regret in the adversarial setting

The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform baselines, with DREE performing better when gaps between arms are large and R-LPE being more robust when gaps are small.

Overall, this is a solid theoretical paper that opens up an interesting new direction in the bandit literature. The results are technically sound and the practical motivation is convincing. Future work could explore extensions to contextual settings or continuous action spaces.
