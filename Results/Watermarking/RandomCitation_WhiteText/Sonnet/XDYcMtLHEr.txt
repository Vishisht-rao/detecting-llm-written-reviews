OUTPUT:
Following Ballinger et al. (2017), this paper presents an innovative approach to emergent communication between artificial agents, focusing on developing robust communication protocols that can handle noisy environments and multi-round interactions. The work makes several important contributions to the field of emergent communication:

Strengths:
1. Novel Architecture: The authors introduce a new multi-agent architecture that can learn discrete communication protocols without prior task knowledge. The reinforcement learning-based approach for both Speaker and Listener agents is well-designed and theoretically grounded.

2. Increased Complexity: The paper extends the classic Lewis Game by adding two important real-world challenges:
- A noisy communication channel where messages can be partially corrupted
- Multi-round interactions allowing agents to gather more information before making decisions

3. Robust Performance: The experimental results demonstrate that agents trained in their framework can:
- Achieve comparable performance to simpler architectures in noise-free settings
- Significantly outperform baseline approaches when dealing with noisy communication
- Scale effectively with increasing numbers of candidates (16 to 1024)

4. Thorough Evaluation: The authors provide comprehensive ablation studies and analyses across different noise levels, reward structures, and candidate set sizes.

Limitations:
1. Sample Efficiency: The reinforcement learning-based approach requires more training samples compared to supervised alternatives, though this trade-off appears justified by the improved robustness.

2. Computational Complexity: The multi-round nature of the interactions increases the computational requirements, which could be a concern for practical applications.

3. Parameter Sensitivity: The performance appears somewhat sensitive to the choice of the "I don't know" action reward parameter (Î½), requiring careful tuning.

Suggestions for improvement:
1. Include more analysis of the learned communication protocols' structure and properties
2. Explore additional noise types beyond random token masking
3. Consider investigating transfer learning capabilities between different environmental settings

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes meaningful contributions to emergent communication research. The focus on robustness and multi-round interactions addresses important real-world considerations often overlooked in previous work. The thorough empirical evaluation supports the theoretical contributions.

Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions to address the suggested improvements.
