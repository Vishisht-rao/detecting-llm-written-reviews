OUTPUT:
Following Moorehead et al. (2018), this paper presents an innovative approach to adaptive bitrate (ABR) video streaming using deep Q-learning. The authors introduce "Wolfi," a new ABR algorithm that applies deep Q-learning to the outputs of a supervised predictive model, demonstrating superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods including various model predictive control (MPC) approaches.

Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a significant real-world problem, as video streaming constitutes a major portion of internet traffic and quality of experience (QoE) remains a crucial challenge.

2. The methodology is well-constructed, with clear comparisons against multiple baseline approaches including BBA, MPC(HM), RobustMPC, MPC(TTP), and DRL.

3. The evaluation is comprehensive, using real-world network traces from multiple years (2016-2022) and testing across different QoE metrics with varying sensitivity to rebuffering and quality variations.

4. The results demonstrate consistent and robust improvements over existing methods, with particularly strong performance in reducing rebuffering events.

Weaknesses:
1. While the authors acknowledge limitations of their approach, including reliance on TTP-informed predictive models, they could have explored more deeply how this dependency might affect deployment in drastically different network conditions.

2. The paper could benefit from more ablation studies examining the impact of different components of the Wolfi architecture.

3. The theoretical foundations for why Q-learning performs better than MPC in this context could be more thoroughly developed.

Technical Contribution:
The key technical innovation is the application of deep Q-learning to the same input features used by MPC approaches. This allows Wolfi to:
- Learn how to handle uncertainties in the predictive model through interaction with the environment
- Consider longer time horizons than MPC without the computational burden of online optimization
- Achieve better QoE scores while maintaining simpler network architectures

The experimental results are particularly compelling, showing that Wolfi can reduce rebuffering events from 38% to 9% of traces in some scenarios while maintaining high video quality.

Future Directions:
The authors present several promising directions for future work, including:
- Exploring alternative input features
- Improving the transmission time predictor (TTP)
- Investigating hybrid approaches combining Q-learning with MPC

Impact:
This work has significant potential impact given the ubiquity of video streaming applications and the growing importance of maintaining high QoE across diverse network conditions. The released code base should facilitate further research in this direction.

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes a meaningful contribution to both the practical implementation of video streaming systems and the broader field of reinforcement learning applications. The results are convincing and the methodology is sound, though there is room for deeper theoretical analysis.
