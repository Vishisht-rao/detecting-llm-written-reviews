OUTPUT:
Following Tam et al. (2021), this paper presents novel theoretical and empirical analyses of noise scheduling strategies for diffusion-based generative models, making several important contributions:

Strengths:
1. The paper introduces WSNR (weighted signal-noise-ratio), a new metric that consistently quantifies noise levels across different image resolutions and spaces (RGB/latent). This addresses a key limitation of existing noise schedules that perform poorly at higher resolutions.

2. The theoretical analysis of the probability flow ODE sampling process provides valuable insights into the relationship between initial noise distribution and generated data diversity. The data-driven sampling noise schedule derived from this analysis helps optimize the integration interval.

3. The empirical investigation of evaluation points' impact on generation quality leads to practical guidelines for dynamically selecting numerical methods based on computational constraints.

4. The proposed approach achieves improved FID scores on standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10 and FFHQ-64) without requiring additional training, demonstrating practical utility.

Weaknesses:
1. The dynamic schedule is limited to explicit Runge-Kutta methods (Heun's, Midpoint, 3rd-order) and doesn't explore more advanced ODE solvers like DPM-Solver or DEIS Solver, as acknowledged by the authors.

2. While the theoretical analysis is thorough, some of the mathematical derivations in the appendix could benefit from more detailed explanations and intuitive interpretations.

3. The experimental evaluation focuses primarily on FID scores - additional metrics and qualitative results would help better assess the improvements in generation quality.

The paper makes significant theoretical contributions to understanding noise scheduling in diffusion models while providing practical improvements. The WSNR metric and data-driven sampling approach represent important advances in making diffusion models more effective across different resolutions and computational budgets.

The writing is clear and well-structured, with good connections between the theoretical analysis and practical implications. The limitations are appropriately acknowledged, and the work opens up interesting directions for future research in optimizing diffusion model sampling.

Overall, this is a strong paper that advances both the theoretical understanding and practical capabilities of diffusion-based generative models.

Recommendation: Accept. The contributions are significant and well-validated, despite some minor limitations.
