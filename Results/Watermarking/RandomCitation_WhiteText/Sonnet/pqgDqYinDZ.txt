OUTPUT:
Following Marte et al. (2017), this paper presents an interesting approach to multi-objective inverse reinforcement learning (MOIRL) that learns from demonstrations of multiple experts with different preferences. The key innovation is the assumption of a common vectorized reward function shared across experts, with differences in behavior arising from different preference weightings of the reward components.

Strengths:
1. The approach is well-motivated by real-world scenarios where demonstrations come from multiple experts with varying preferences (e.g., military drones balancing aggression vs. risk).

2. The method shows good sample efficiency by leveraging demonstrations from all experts rather than training separate models, achieving competitive performance with fewer environment steps compared to baselines.

3. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, testing on both discrete (Deep Sea Treasure) and continuous (MuJoCo) environments, with ablation studies and correlation analysis of learned rewards.

4. The model demonstrates good transferability, being able to handle preferences not seen during training by interpolating between expert preferences.

Weaknesses:
1. The theoretical justification for why the common reward assumption holds could be stronger. While intuitively reasonable, more formal analysis would strengthen the paper.

2. The approach requires knowing expert preferences during training. As noted in the limitations section, learning these preferences automatically would make the method more practical.

3. The performance seems sensitive to how distinct the expert demonstrations are along different reward dimensions. This is acknowledged but could use more systematic analysis.

4. The comparison baseline set is somewhat limited, focusing mainly on GAIL. Additional comparisons to other multi-expert IRL methods would be valuable.

Suggestions:
1. Include theoretical analysis of when the common reward assumption is expected to hold or break down.

2. Explore methods for automatically inferring expert preferences from demonstrations.

3. Add experiments with more baselines, particularly recent multi-expert IRL approaches.

4. Provide more detailed analysis of failure cases and limitations of the approach.

Overall, this is a solid paper that makes a meaningful contribution to multi-expert IRL, with clear practical applications and good empirical results. The limitations are well-acknowledged and provide clear directions for future work. The paper should be accepted pending minor revisions to address the suggested improvements.
