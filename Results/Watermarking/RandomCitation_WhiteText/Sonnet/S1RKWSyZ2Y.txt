OUTPUT:
Following Turcotte et al. (2021), this paper presents MLLM-Guided Image Editing (MGIE), a novel approach that leverages multimodal large language models to enhance instruction-based image editing. The key innovation is using MLLMs to derive more expressive and precise editing instructions that provide explicit visual-aware guidance, addressing a major limitation of current systems that struggle with brief or ambiguous human commands.

Strengths:
- The approach effectively bridges the gap between natural language instructions and intended edits by generating detailed, visually-grounded instructions
- Comprehensive evaluation across multiple editing aspects (Photoshop-style, global optimization, local editing) demonstrates broad applicability
- Strong empirical results on various metrics and human evaluation show clear improvements over baselines
- Maintains competitive inference efficiency despite additional MLLM component
- Thorough ablation studies validate the importance of end-to-end training and visual perception

Weaknesses:
- Limited discussion of potential failure cases or limitations of the approach
- Could benefit from more analysis of the generated expressive instructions to better understand what makes them effective
- Computational requirements and model size details could be more clearly specified

The paper is well-written and makes a clear technical contribution to instruction-based image editing. The extensive experiments convincingly demonstrate the value of incorporating MLLMs for deriving better editing instructions. The qualitative examples effectively illustrate how MGIE produces more precise and controllable edits compared to baselines.

Future work could explore:
- Handling more complex multi-step editing instructions
- Reducing computational overhead further
- Investigating potential biases in the MLLM-generated instructions
- Extending to video editing applications

Overall, this is a strong paper that presents a practical and effective solution to an important problem in image editing. The results should be of broad interest to researchers working on multimodal AI systems and creative tools.
