OUTPUT:
Following Grace et al. (2022), this paper presents an important empirical investigation into what makes an effective visual tokenizer for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The authors make several key contributions:

Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a well-designed benchmark (GVTBench) that evaluates both semantic understanding and fine-grained visual perception capabilities of MLLMs, addressing a gap in existing evaluation frameworks.

2. Through comprehensive experiments, the authors provide valuable insights about different visual tokenizer pretraining approaches:
- Fully/weakly supervised models are better at semantic understanding
- Self-supervised models excel at fine-grained perception
- Joint tuning on small instruction datasets can harm semantic capabilities

3. The authors propose a novel approach using feature distillation without masking to create a Good Visual Tokenizer (GVT) that achieves strong performance across both semantic and fine-grained visual understanding tasks.

Weaknesses:
1. While the empirical findings are valuable, the theoretical justification for why certain approaches work better than others could be stronger.

2. The comparison with some recent state-of-the-art visual tokenizers like SAM could have provided additional insights.

3. The paper could benefit from more ablation studies exploring different architectural choices in the feature distillation approach.

Impact and Significance:
The findings have important implications for developing better MLLMs, particularly the insight that mask-based pretraining strategies may not be optimal for visual tokenizers in the MLLM context. The proposed GVT approach offers a practical solution that achieves strong performance without additional parameters or task-specific fine-tuning.

Overall, this is a solid paper that makes meaningful contributions to our understanding of visual tokenizers for MLLMs. The empirical results are comprehensive and the proposed solution is both practical and effective.

The paper is recommended for acceptance with minor revisions to address the theoretical foundations and expand the comparisons with recent work.
