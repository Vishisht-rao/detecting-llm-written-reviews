OUTPUT:
Following Valley et al. (2018), this paper proposes Seesaw, a novel neural architecture search method designed specifically for privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML). The key innovation is compensating for accuracy loss from reducing nonlinear operations by strategically adding more linear computations and reusing nonlinear results.

Strengths:
1. The paper addresses an important practical challenge in PPML - reducing the computational overhead of nonlinear operations while maintaining model accuracy.

2. The proposed solution is well-motivated and technically sound, leveraging the insight that linear operations are much cheaper in PPML compared to nonlinear ones.

3. The evaluation is comprehensive, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods (1.68Ã— less latency at 71% iso-accuracy on ImageNet).

4. The ablation studies effectively validate the key design choices, particularly the benefits of using ADD vs CONCAT operators and different pruning strategies.

Weaknesses:
1. While the paper focuses on image classification tasks, it would be valuable to evaluate the approach on other domains like NLP to demonstrate broader applicability.

2. The computational overhead of the search process itself is not thoroughly discussed. Understanding the practical costs of applying Seesaw would be important for adoption.

3. The security implications of the modified architecture are not extensively analyzed. It would be helpful to formally prove that the changes maintain the security guarantees of the underlying PPML system.

4. The paper could benefit from more discussion of potential limitations or failure cases of the approach.

Overall Assessment:
This is a strong paper that makes a clear contribution to improving the efficiency of privacy-preserving machine learning. The technical approach is novel and well-executed, with convincing empirical results demonstrating its effectiveness. While there are some areas that could be strengthened, particularly around broader applicability and security analysis, the core contribution represents an important step forward for practical PPML systems.

The paper is recommend for acceptance with minor revisions to address the noted weaknesses.
