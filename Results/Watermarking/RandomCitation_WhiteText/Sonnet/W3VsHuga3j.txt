OUTPUT:
Following Cox et al. (2021), this paper introduces an important new framework called Latent Inference Budget Models (L-IBMs) for modeling boundedly rational agents with unknown computational constraints. The key innovation is explicitly modeling agents' inference budgets as latent variables that control the runtime of iterative inference algorithms, rather than using standard approaches that add uniform noise to optimal decisions.

Strengths:
1. The paper makes both theoretical and empirical contributions by:
- Developing a general framework for modeling computational constraints in decision-making
- Showing how L-IBMs can be efficiently implemented for anytime algorithms
- Demonstrating strong empirical results across three diverse domains (maze navigation, pragmatic language understanding, and chess)

2. The experimental validation is comprehensive, testing the approach on both synthetic and real-world data while comparing against relevant baselines. The results show L-IBMs can:
- Match or outperform Boltzmann models for predicting agent behavior
- Recover meaningful inference budgets that correlate with player skill and task difficulty
- Scale to complex domains like chess gameplay

3. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with intuitive examples and visualizations that help convey the key ideas.

Limitations:
1. The theoretical analysis could be expanded, particularly around:
- Formal conditions for when L-IBMs are guaranteed to recover true inference budgets
- Connections to other frameworks for bounded rationality
- Computational complexity analysis

2. While the empirical results are strong, some questions remain about:
- Sensitivity to hyperparameter choices
- Performance in more adversarial settings
- Scalability to even larger domains

3. The current experiments focus on settings where the reward function is relatively simple - exploring more complex reward structures could be valuable.

Impact and Future Work:
This paper opens up several promising directions for future research:
- Extending L-IBMs to handle more complex reward functions and constraints
- Applications to human-AI interaction and assistance
- Theoretical analysis of recovery guarantees
- Integration with other approaches to modeling bounded rationality

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes substantial contributions to modeling boundedly rational agents. The framework is both theoretically grounded and practically useful, with compelling empirical validation across multiple domains. While there are some limitations and open questions, these suggest natural directions for future work rather than fundamental flaws in the approach.
