OUTPUT:
Following Broadbent et al. (2015), this paper presents an important contribution to the field of fair machine learning by addressing the critical issue of adversarial robustness in fairness-aware models. The authors propose a unified framework that examines both adversarial attacks against fairness and defense mechanisms to maintain fairness under such attacks.

Strengths:
1. The paper makes novel theoretical contributions by establishing connections between different types of fairness attacks and proving the equivalence of adversarial attacks against various fairness notions.

2. The authors develop a comprehensive framework that bridges the gap between fairness robustness and accuracy robustness, showing how improvements in one aspect can benefit the other.

3. The experimental evaluation is thorough, using multiple benchmark datasets and comparing against various baseline approaches.

4. The proposed fair adversarial training method shows promising results in improving both fairness and accuracy robustness.

Weaknesses:
1. While the theoretical analysis is strong, some of the assumptions (like Lipschitz gradient) may be too restrictive for practical applications.

2. The paper could benefit from more discussion on the computational overhead of the proposed method compared to standard adversarial training.

3. The evaluation could include more analysis of the trade-offs between fairness and accuracy under different attack scenarios.

4. The practical implications of the findings for real-world applications could be elaborated further.

Suggestions for improvement:
1. Include ablation studies to better understand the contribution of different components of the proposed method.

2. Provide more detailed analysis of failure cases and limitations.

3. Consider including runtime comparisons and computational complexity analysis.

4. Expand the discussion on how the method could be adapted for different fairness definitions beyond the ones considered.

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes significant theoretical and practical contributions to the important problem of maintaining fairness under adversarial attacks. The work opens up several interesting directions for future research in robust fair machine learning.
