OUTPUT:
Following Quiroga et al. (2022), this paper presents an important theoretical advancement in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) by proposing a novel model-free algorithm for two-player zero-sum Markov games that achieves optimal sample complexity in terms of the horizon dependency.

Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a significant open problem by developing the first model-free algorithm that matches the optimal O(H³SAB/ϵ²) sample complexity of model-based methods.

2. The technical innovation of using a "min-gap based reference-advantage decomposition" technique is well-motivated and theoretically sound. This adaptation of single-agent RL techniques to the multi-agent setting required careful handling of the CCE oracle's impact on value function monotonicity.

3. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, with detailed proofs establishing both upper bounds on sample complexity and showing optimality with respect to the horizon H, number of states S, and accuracy ϵ.

4. The stage-based algorithm design simplifies both implementation and analysis while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Limitations:
1. The algorithm still has suboptimal dependency on the action space size (AB rather than A+B), though the authors acknowledge this limitation and discuss potential future work combining their techniques with V-learning approaches.

2. The paper is primarily theoretical and would benefit from empirical evaluation to validate the practical performance improvements suggested by the theory.

3. The assumptions about access to a CCE oracle may limit practical applicability in some settings.

4. The analysis focuses on the tabular setting and doesn't address function approximation, which is often needed in practical applications.

Suggestions:
1. Include experimental results comparing the proposed algorithm to existing model-free and model-based approaches.

2. Discuss potential extensions to handle continuous state/action spaces through function approximation.

3. Provide more intuition about the practical implementation of the min-gap based reference selection.

4. Consider analyzing the algorithm's robustness to approximate CCE oracles.

Overall, this is a strong theoretical paper that makes a significant contribution to understanding the fundamental limits of model-free MARL algorithms. The results close an important gap in our theoretical understanding while suggesting promising directions for future research in both theory and practice.
