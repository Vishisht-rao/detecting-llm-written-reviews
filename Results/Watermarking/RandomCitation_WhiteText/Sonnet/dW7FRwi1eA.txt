OUTPUT:
Following Fortin et al. (2019), this paper proposes a novel framework called MeDe (Meta Denoising) for learning with noisy labels across multiple target domains. Here is my detailed review:

Strengths:
1. Innovation: The paper presents a creative solution to an important problem by proposing a reusable meta denoiser that can transfer knowledge about label noise across different domains and label sets. This is a significant advance over existing methods that discard learned denoising knowledge after training.

2. Technical Soundness: The approach is well-grounded theoretically, with formal proofs and analysis of generalization bounds. The framework elegantly handles both domain shift and label space differences between source and target domains.

3. Empirical Validation: The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, testing on multiple benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10/100, STL-10) and real-world noisy datasets (CIFAR10-N/100-N). The results demonstrate clear improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

4. Analysis: The visualization experiments and ablation studies provide good insights into how and why the method works, particularly in showing how the meta features maintain consistency across domains.

Weaknesses:
1. Complexity: The method requires training multiple components (meta extractor, meta denoiser, classifier) which increases computational overhead compared to simpler approaches.

2. Assumptions: The approach assumes access to a clean source dataset, which may not always be available in practice. More discussion of this limitation would be helpful.

3. Parameter Sensitivity: While the method shows strong performance, there's limited analysis of sensitivity to key hyperparameters like the selection threshold Ï„%.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Include more ablation studies on architectural choices and hyperparameter settings to provide better practical guidance.

2. Expand the theoretical analysis to characterize when/why the method might fail.

3. Consider experiments on more diverse types of datasets beyond image classification.

4. Provide more detailed computational complexity analysis.

Overall Assessment:
This is a strong paper that makes both theoretical and practical contributions to learning with noisy labels. The proposed MeDe framework addresses an important limitation of existing approaches and demonstrates clear empirical benefits. The thoroughness of both theoretical analysis and experimental validation is commendable. While there are some limitations in terms of computational overhead and assumptions, the core contribution represents a meaningful advance in the field.

Decision: Accept with minor revisions to address the suggested improvements.
