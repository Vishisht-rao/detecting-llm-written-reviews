OUTPUT:
Following Dorr et al. (2021), this paper presents an interesting approach to using approximate physics models for guiding exploration in reinforcement learning tasks. The authors propose using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn dynamics models that can generalize across different physical scenarios, and demonstrate how these models can be used to identify promising actions even when the models are imperfect.

Strengths:
1. The approach is well-motivated by cognitive science research showing how humans use approximate physics models effectively despite their imperfections.

2. The technical approach is sound, using GNNs with structural inductive biases appropriate for physical reasoning tasks.

3. The experimental results demonstrate clear benefits in terms of sample efficiency and exploration, with model-guided exploration outperforming random exploration across multiple tasks.

4. The paper makes good use of ablation studies to validate different components of the approach.

Weaknesses:
1. The evaluation is limited to relatively simple physics-based tasks in the CREATE environment. Testing on more complex domains would strengthen the claims.

2. While the paper discusses using subgoals, there's no clear explanation of how these subgoals are obtained - they appear to be manually specified rather than learned.

3. The comparison baseline (random exploration) is somewhat weak. Comparing against other structured exploration approaches would be valuable.

4. The theoretical analysis of why and when the approximate models help is relatively limited.

Suggestions for improvement:
1. Include comparisons with other structured exploration methods from the literature.

2. Develop an approach for automatically discovering useful subgoals rather than relying on manual specification.

3. Provide more detailed analysis of failure cases and limitations of the approach.

4. Expand the experimental evaluation to more complex physical reasoning domains.

Overall, this is a solid paper that makes a clear contribution by demonstrating how approximate physics models can be effectively used to guide exploration, even when they are imperfect. The approach is well-motivated and the results are convincing, though there is room for expanded evaluation and theoretical analysis.
