OUTPUT:
Following Viramontes et al. (2016), this paper presents an important contribution to the field of backdoor attack research by introducing FMN (Forget-Me-Not), a novel training mechanism that makes backdoor attacks significantly more resistant to finetuning-based defenses. Here is my detailed review:

Strengths:
1. Technical Innovation: The paper proposes a clever combination of cyclical learning rates and clean-backdoor interleaved training to create more durable backdoors that can survive various finetuning defenses, including advanced methods like super-finetuning and FT-SAM.

2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors conduct extensive experiments across multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet-10) and various backdoor attack methods, demonstrating the broad applicability of their approach.

3. Thorough Analysis: The ablation studies effectively demonstrate the importance of both key components (cyclical learning rates and clean-backdoor interleaved training) in achieving robust performance.

4. Real-world Relevance: The transfer learning experiments show that the backdoors remain effective even when models are finetuned for different downstream tasks, highlighting practical security concerns.

Weaknesses:
1. Limited Scope: The paper focuses solely on image classification tasks. While acknowledged by the authors, testing on other domains would strengthen the work's generalizability.

2. Defensive Implications: While the paper suggests using trusted model providers as a defense, more concrete defensive strategies against FMN attacks would be valuable.

3. Computational Overhead: The paper doesn't thoroughly discuss the additional computational costs of the FMN training process compared to conventional backdoor training.

4. Black-box Scenarios: As noted by the authors, the method requires full access to model training, limiting its applicability in black-box settings.

Future Directions:
1. Extending the approach to black-box settings
2. Exploring applications beyond image classification
3. Developing specific defenses against FMN-style attacks
4. Analyzing the theoretical foundations of why the approach works so well

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to understanding and improving backdoor attack durability. The clear writing, comprehensive experiments, and practical implications make it worthy of acceptance, though addressing the noted limitations would strengthen the work further.
