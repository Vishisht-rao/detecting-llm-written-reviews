OUTPUT:
Following Lanham et al. (2020), this paper presents GABins, a novel approach for monocular depth estimation that combines gated attention mechanisms with adaptive depth binning. The method converts the traditional regression problem of depth estimation into a classification task while leveraging the global context capturing capabilities of attention mechanisms.

Strengths:
- The proposed GABins architecture introduces an innovative combination of gated attention and adaptive depth binning that shows strong performance on standard benchmarks
- The method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results on both indoor (NYU-Depth-v2) and outdoor (KITTI) datasets
- The paper provides comprehensive empirical validation through extensive experiments and ablation studies
- The approach demonstrates good generalization capabilities through zero-shot testing on the SUN RGB-D dataset
- The technical exposition is clear and the methodology is well-motivated

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical analysis of why gated attention works better than standard attention mechanisms could be expanded
- The computational complexity analysis of the proposed architecture is somewhat limited
- While the method shows strong performance, the improvements over recent state-of-the-art approaches like iDisc are relatively modest
- The ablation studies could explore more architectural variants to better justify some of the design choices

The paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of monocular depth estimation by proposing an effective new architecture that combines attention mechanisms with adaptive depth binning. The experimental results validate the approach's effectiveness across multiple datasets and scenarios. While some aspects of the theoretical analysis could be strengthened, the practical utility of the method is well-demonstrated.

The writing is generally clear and the paper is well-structured, though some technical details in the methodology section could be explained more thoroughly. Overall, this represents a solid contribution to the field that advances the state-of-the-art in monocular depth estimation.

Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions to address the theoretical analysis and expand the ablation studies.
