OUTPUT:
Following Marx et al. (2024), this paper presents a novel approach called S ELFEVAL, which repurposes text-to-image generative models for evaluating their own text-image understanding capabilities by calculating the likelihood of real images given text prompts. The motivation behind this work is compelling, addressing the need for scalable and automated assessment metrics for generative models, particularly given the challenges associated with human evaluations in the context of multimodal models.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach:** The concept of 'inverting' generative models to serve discriminative tasks is innovative and could have significant implications for automated evaluation in generative modeling. By utilizing the generative model itself, the authors propose a method that circumvents limitations found in existing evaluation metrics that depend on external models like CLIP.

2. **Evaluation of Fine-Grained Tasks:** The authors effectively utilize standard datasets to assess fine-grained capabilities of the model, such as attribute binding and counting. This level of granularity in evaluation could lead to a better understanding of the specific strengths and weaknesses of different generative models.

3. **Alignment with Human Evaluations:** The reported agreement between S ELFEVAL's results and human evaluations adds substantial credibility to their proposed method. This suggests that S ELFEVAL may serve as a practical tool for researchers who require reliable evaluation metrics without extensive human resources.

4. **Broad Applicability:** The implications of S ELFEVAL extend beyond the specific application to text-to-image diffusion models; the authors indicate potential applications in other domains such as text-to-audio and text-to-video models.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Mechanistic Clarity:** While the methodology is described, some details can be clearer, particularly the practical aspects of how likelihood estimations are computed and how numerical stability issues are managed. A more detailed explanation of the Monte Carlo estimation process and the choice of hyperparameters would strengthen the paper.

2. **Limitations of Proposed Metrics:** Although S ELFEVAL shows promise, the paper could benefit from a critical discussion regarding its limitations compared to conventional techniques. For instance, how does S ELFEVAL perform in situations where the model might overfit to training data or in unseen scenarios?

3. **Comparative Analysis and Robustness:** Further comparative analysis with a diverse set of existing automatic metrics, beyond CLIP, would enhance the validation of S ELFEVAL. Providing empirical evidence showcasing its robustness across various datasets and tasks would be advantageous.

4. **User Applicability:** While the authors highlight ease of use, specific guidelines or a framework for implementing S ELFEVAL in practice could help users adopt this metric in their own research effectively. Illustrative examples of its application across different models and domains would enrich the discussion.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper is a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and multimodal evaluations. The authors present a well-founded methodology that addresses key challenges in the assessment of generative models. With some enhancements in clarity and depth regarding the methodology and comparative performance, this work could have a profound impact on how automated evaluations are conducted in generative modeling. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the weaknesses identified.
