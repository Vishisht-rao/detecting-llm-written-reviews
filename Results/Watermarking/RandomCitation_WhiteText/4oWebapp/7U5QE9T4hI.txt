OUTPUT:
Following Bock et al. (2024), this paper presents a novel approach to addressing concept drift in online time series forecasting through the proposed LEAF framework (Learning to Extrapolate and Adjust for Forecasting). The paper successfully outlines the challenges posed by the non-stationary nature of time series data, categorizing concept drift into macro-drift and micro-drift, and emphasizes the need for real-time adaptability in forecasting models. Below is a detailed review of the strengths and weaknesses of the manuscript:

### Strengths:

1. **Clear Problem Definition**: The authors effectively articulate the problem of concept drift in time series forecasting, distinguishing between macro- and micro-drift. This classification aids in understanding the nuances of the forecast challenges they aim to address.

2. **Innovative Framework (LEAF)**: The two-stage meta-learning approach—extrapolation and adjustment—provides a structured method for handling various types of concept drift. This model-agnostic nature enhances the potential applicability of LEAF across different deep prediction models.

3. **Extensive Experiments**: The authors conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of LEAF compared to state-of-the-art methods. The results confidently indicate significant performance improvements, particularly under conditions simulating concept drift.

4. **Open Source Datasets**: By providing access to three benchmark datasets with diverse concept drifts, the authors contribute valuable resources to the research community. This step is likely to facilitate further studies in this domain.

5. **Ablation Studies**: The inclusion of ablation studies to analyze the contributions of different components of LEAF further strengthens the paper’s claims regarding the framework's efficacy. It clearly demonstrates how each module plays a role in improving predictive performance.

6. **Real-World relevance**: The discussion on practical implications underscores the importance of adaptability in forecasting models across sectors such as energy and finance, enhancing the paper's relevance to applied fields.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Methodological Clarity**: While the methodology is generally well-presented, certain sections could benefit from clearer explanations, especially regarding the optimization processes in the meta-training phase. A more comprehensive breakdown of the algorithm could enhance reproducibility and understanding.

2. **Comparative Analysis**: Although the paper compares LEAF to several baselines, it may benefit from a broader comparison that includes more recent methods in the field that also focus on multi-level concept drift adaptation. This could provide a more thorough landscape of related work and establish LEAF's contributions more firmly.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**: The primary performance metrics (MSE and MAE) are appropriate, but including additional metrics (such as R-squared or model interpretability analyses) could provide a more rounded evaluation of LEAF's effectiveness.

4. **Hyperparameter Settings**: While sensitivity analyses on hyperparameters are provided, there is limited discussion on how these parameters were chosen or the impact of various settings during real applications. Documentation of this process could benefit practitioners looking to implement the framework.

5. **Future Work**: The paper briefly mentions future directions, including the integration of LEAF with continual learning techniques. However, a more in-depth exploration of possible extensions and theoretical implications of the framework would improve the manuscript’s completeness.

### Conclusion:

In summary, the paper presents a significant advancement in the field of online time series forecasting with its innovative LEAF framework. The contributions are well-supported by empirical evidence and extend the current understanding of handling concept drift in real-world scenarios. Despite minor improvements in clarity and the breadth of comparative analysis, the manuscript stands as a compelling addition to the literature and promises to influence future research directions in adaptive time series forecasting. I recommend acceptance of this paper with minor revisions.
