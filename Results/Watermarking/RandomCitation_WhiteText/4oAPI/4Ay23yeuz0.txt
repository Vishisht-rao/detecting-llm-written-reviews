**Review of "MIXED-TYPE TABULAR DATA SYNTHESIS WITH SCORE-BASED DIFFUSION IN LATENT SPACE"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents TABSYN, a novel method designed for the synthesis of mixed-type tabular data using score-based diffusion models within a variational autoencoder (VAE)-crafted latent space. The authors argue that existing approaches have struggled to effectively model mixed data types and capture complex inter-column relationships in tabular datasets. TABSYN aims to address these challenges by transforming raw tabular data into a continuous embedding space for subsequent diffusion modeling. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of TABSYN through extensive experiments on six real-world datasets, showing that it outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of data generation quality, speed, and versatility.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovation**: The integration of a diffusion model with a VAE for tabular data synthesis is a novel approach that shows promise for effectively handling mixed data types. The transformation of categorical and numerical features into a unified latent space is particularly innovative.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The authors conduct extensive evaluations comparing TABSYN to seven competitive baselines across multiple datasets and metrics, including column-wise distribution estimation, pair-wise correlation estimation, and downstream task performance. This thorough evaluation gives credibility to their claims of TABSYN's superior performance.

3. **Performance Gains**: The reported improvements in error rates (e.g., an 86% reduction in column-wise distribution shape estimation error relative to the best baseline) are compelling and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The authors also illustrate its efficiency in speed, requiring significantly fewer reverse steps than competing methods.

4. **Public Availability**: The availability of the code enhances reproducibility and allows for further exploration by the research community.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity of Implementation**: Although the paper provides a detailed description of the methodology, the implementation appears complex, and the reliance on a transformer-based architecture within the VAE might pose challenges for researchers unfamiliar with such models. More detailed guidance or resources for practical implementation would benefit potential users.

2. **Data Diversity**: While the authors test their method on six datasets, it would be valuable to see TABSYN tested on a broader range of datasets with varying characteristics to assess its generalization capabilities. This would strengthen claims of its versatility across different types of tabular data.

3. **Theoretical Justification**: While the paper includes some theoretical analysis, there is room for deeper exploration of why the proposed approaches—like the linear noise schedule—effectively reduce errors in the reverse diffusion process. Insights into the underlying mechanics would be beneficial for readers.

4. **Potential Overfitting**: Given the complexity of models and the potential overfitting that could occur with a limited training dataset, it would be instructive to include cross-validation strategies or measures to safeguard against overfitting in future work.

**Minor Comments:**
- The authors may want to clarify the meaning of certain jargon and provide definitions for specific terms for improved accessibility to a wider audience.
- A citation to "Jensen et al. (2023)" appears necessary in sections discussing existing diffusion-based methods, so as to situate TABSYN within a broader context of recent advancements in the field.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper provides a significant contribution to the field of synthetic data generation for tabular data, introducing TABSYN as an innovative method for handling mixed data types via score-based diffusion in latent space. The strong experimental results and thorough evaluation suggest that TABSYN may become a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners alike. Future work should focus on broader applicability, additional theoretical insights, and practical implementation guidance to maximize its impact.
