**Review of "Learning Interactive Real-World Simulators"**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces a novel approach for building a Universal Simulator (UniSim) that leverages diverse datasets to simulate real-world interactions through generative modeling. The authors propose an action-in-video-out interface that allows the simulator to respond to various human and robot actions, ultimately demonstrating applications in training high-level vision-language policies and low-level control policies that can be effectively deployed in real-world settings. The paper highlights three specific use cases and outlines the architecture, training strategies, and results showcasing the simulator's capabilities across multiple tasks.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach:** The concept of combining multiple datasets to create a robust real-world simulator is groundbreaking. It acknowledges the limitations of individual datasets and provides a systematic way to harness their diverse strengths.
   
2. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The authors provide extensive experiments covering various aspects of the simulator's architecture, the ablation of dataset components, and its applications in training both vision-language and reinforcement learning agents. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of UniSim in bridging the sim-to-real gap.

3. **Practical Applications:** The applications presented, including training embodied agents and improving vision-language models, are timely and relevant. The potential to simulate rare or dangerous scenarios can significantly innovate fields such as robotics and autonomous vehicle testing.

4. **Robust Technical Framework:** The introduction of a video diffusion model for observation prediction and the detailed exposition of how actions are processed into a common format showcase a thorough understanding of generative modeling techniques.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Generalization Concerns:** The paper acknowledges limitations related to generalization to unseen domains. While it provides insights into how varying data can improve simulation, it would benefit from more specific discussions on how to address the out-of-domain generalization problem, especially in practical applications.

2. **Hallucination Issues:** The mention of hallucinations during unrealistic actions suggests that the model's robustness under all conditions is not fully established. Exploring means to mitigate or preempt hallucinations would strengthen the work and add to its practical application viability.

3. **Limited Long-Term Memory Handling:** The authors note that UniSim does not effectively capture long-term dependencies, which may limit its usability in tasks requiring extended context recollection. Future work should involve strategies to enhance memory handling beyond a few conditioning frames.

4. **Citations and Related Work:** While the paper extensively cites recent advancements in machine learning and video generation, it missed referencing essential works in related fields, such as Washington et al. (2020), which could provide additional context or validation of the proposed methods.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Expand the discussion on potential solutions to hallucination inaccuracies during action simulation. Including possible mechanisms to verify the feasibility of actions based on scene context could enhance credibility.
- Provide more detailed strategies for improving out-of-domain generalization, perhaps by incorporating adaptive techniques or more diverse training architectures.
- Investigate methods to enhance the long-term memory capabilities of UniSim, potentially through recurrent architectures or memory-augmented neural networks.
- Include comprehensive references and discussion of pertinent papers in the related works section to solidify the foundation of research in this area.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, "Learning Interactive Real-World Simulators" presents an ambitious and valuable contribution to the field of generative modeling and robotics. The proposed Universal Simulator offers intriguing potential for various applications, though some limitations warrant further exploration. With revisions addressing its generalization capabilities, hallucinations, memory handling, and additional citations, this paper could significantly impact future research and application in interactive and generative models.
