**Review of "One-Shot Empirical Privacy Estimation for Federated Learning"**

**Overview:**
The paper presents a novel method for estimating privacy loss in federated learning (FL) environments while avoiding the extensive retraining usually associated with existing techniques. The authors address significant shortcomings of current auditing methods, such as their reliance on strong adversarial assumptions, extensive model retraining, and tailored applicability to specific tasks or datasets. Instead, the proposed "one-shot" empirical privacy estimator allows for efficient auditing within a single training run, making it particularly relevant for real-world deployment.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Relevance:** The approach seeks to bridge an important gap in the field of privacy estimation for federated learning. By addressing the practical limitations of existing auditing techniques, this research contributes to making privacy preserving technologies more scalable and applicable in real-world scenarios.

2. **Methodological Rigor:** The paper provides a theoretically sound framework for estimating privacy loss under the Gaussian mechanism. The authors detail the statistical foundation of their method, demonstrating its provable correctness when applied to user-level differential privacy.

3. **Empirical Validation:** The authors validate their method through extensive experiments on established benchmarks, showing that their estimates are reasonable and sometimes even conservative compared to analytical bounds. This empirical evaluation lends credibility to their claims regarding the adequacy and reliability of the proposed privacy estimates.

4. **Generality:** The method is not constrained by specific model architectures or task types, making it broadly applicable across various federated learning settings. This feature significantly enhances the practicality and impact of the approach.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Clarity in Presentation:** While the paper overall is well-organized, certain sections, particularly those involving complex statistical concepts like the derivations in the Gaussian framework, might benefit from more detailed explanations or illustrative examples to improve accessibility for readers unfamiliar with these methodologies.

2. **Assumptions and Limitations:** Although the authors mention that their approach does not require extensive adversarial assumptions, the potential impact of such assumptions on the overall efficacy of the proposed technique is not deeply explored. It would be beneficial for users to understand the extent to which these assumptions might still limit the practical utility of the approach.

3. **Future Work and Directions:** The paper concludes by mentioning future work on empirical validation against strong adversarial attacks, which is promising. More explicit suggestions for potential avenues of exploration could have enriched the discussion and provided clearer guidance for subsequent research endeavors.

4. **Citation of Previous Work:** I noticed that the paper cites "Morris et al. (2024)," but provides no further context or discussion regarding its relevance or findings. This could lead to confusion among readers and reduce the perceived coherence of the literature review.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper offers significant advancements in the area of empirical privacy estimation for federated learning. The proposed technique shows promise in providing a robust, practical solution to privacy auditing in machine learning systems while being applicable across various scenarios. Addressing the aforementioned weaknesses could enhance the clarity and impact of the work. I recommend acceptance for presentation at the conference, as it makes a strong contribution to the ongoing discourse in privacy-preserving machine learning.
