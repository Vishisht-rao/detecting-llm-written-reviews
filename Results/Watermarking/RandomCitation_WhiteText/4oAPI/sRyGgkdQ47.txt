**Review of "Making Batch Normalization Great in Federated Deep Learning"**

**Summary**
The paper presents an analysis of Batch Normalization (BN) in the context of Federated Learning (FL), identifying significant challenges posed by non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data characteristics across clients. The authors propose a novel approach, termed FIXBN, which aims to improve the performance of BN in FL settings without substantial architectural changes, extra communication costs, or additional training. The significance of their findings is underscored by experiments showing that FIXBN outperforms Group Normalization (GN), the commonly recommended alternative in FL, across several tasks and datasets.

**Strengths**
1. **Novel Contributions**: The paper tackles a crucial issue in the application of BN within FL, a topic often overlooked in the literature. The identification of performance degradation of BN even with high-frequency communication between clients and a server adds important depth to our understanding of normalization techniques in diverse data setups.
   
2. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The authors conduct thorough experiments on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, Tiny-ImageNet, Cityscapes) and demonstrate the efficacy of FIXBN compared to both traditional BN and GN, with systematic comparisons that highlight performance across different conditions.

3. **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is well-organized, clearly presenting the problem, proposed solution, experimental results, and related work. The methodology, particularly the two-stage training approach, is explained concisely, facilitating understanding of the proposed framework.

4. **Impact on the Community**: Given the growing importance of federated learning due to privacy concerns and decentralized data settings, the insights provided would be beneficial for both theoretical exploration and practical implementations in this area.

**Weaknesses**
1. **Theoretical Justification**: While the empirical results are promising, the paper could benefit from a more thorough theoretical analysis explaining why the proposed method, FIXBN, effectively mitigates the issues identified with BN in FL. Such an analysis could address potential skepticism regarding the generalizability of the findings across other architectures or tasks.

2. **Limited Scope of Comparison**: The paper primarily focuses on comparing BN and GN; thus, it may fall short in consideration of other normalization techniques that have emerged recently or might be more suited to FL. A broader comparison could provide additional context and support for the advocacy of FIXBN.

3. **Reproducibility Concerns**: The details on hyperparameter tuning, model training configurations, and variations in datasets such as CIFAR-10 could be elaborated further. Multiple runs and variance measures are acknowledged, but a more explicit handling of reproducibility (e.g., details in an appendix) would enhance the paperâ€™s robustness.

4. **Citations and Related Works**: The citation of prior works is somewhat limited; notably, it would be helpful to include earlier works relevant to normalization in FL, apart from those mentioned. A reference to "Cortez et al. (2020)" might be valuable for establishing foundational context in federated efficient learning.

**Conclusion**
Overall, this paper addresses a pertinent challenge in the rapidly evolving field of federated learning with a well-motivated approach and compelling empirical evidence supporting their findings. With minor enhancements in theoretical backing and consideration of a wider range of normalization methods, this paper could substantially advance the dialogue surrounding effective training practices in federated learning contexts. I recommend acceptance for presentation at the conference, with suggestions for clarifications and improvements to strengthen the publication's impact.
