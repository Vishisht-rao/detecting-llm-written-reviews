**Review of "Online GNN Evaluation Under Test-time Graph Distribution Shifts"**

This paper addresses a significant challenge in the deployment of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in real-world applications: evaluating their performance on unseen and unlabeled graphs under distribution shifts. The authors introduce a novel research problem, termed "online GNN evaluation," and propose a new metric called the LEarning BEhavior Discrepancy score (LEBED) to estimate the generalization error of well-trained GNN models during test time. The methodology includes a parameter-free optimality criterion, enabling GNN models to be effectively retrained for online evaluation without access to the training graph.

### Strengths

1. **Novel Contribution**: The paper addresses a pressing challenge in the field of GNNs, which is evaluating models on unlabeled and unseen data where training data is not accessible. By framing this as an online evaluation problem, the authors open up new avenues for research and application in graph learning.

2. **LEBED Metric**: The proposed LEBED score integrates both node prediction discrepancies and structural reconstruction discrepancies, which provides a comprehensive measure of model performance under various distribution shifts. This innovative approach is well justified and may help bridge the gap between theoretical advancements in GNNs and their practical deployment.

3. **Extensive Experiments**: The authors conduct thorough experiments on multiple real-world datasets, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed method. The strong correlation between the LEBED scores and ground-truth test errors adds credibility to the metric and indicates its potential utility in practical applications.

4. **Relatable Context**: The paper situates its contributions well within the existing body of work, drawing clear distinctions between the proposed evaluation method and existing approaches for CNNs and GNNs under different settings. 

### Weaknesses

1. **Complexity of Methodology**: While the proposed method is innovative, it may be perceived as quite complex, which might hinder reproducibility. The paper does provide some implementation details, but a more detailed description of the computational steps could enhance clarity.

2. **Limited Comparisons with Existing Metrics**: The authors mainly compare their metric against a limited number of existing methods, which may not fully demonstrate the superiority or uniqueness of LEBED across a wider range of scenarios. Including more diverse baseline methods could strengthen the paper's claims regarding the performance improvements of LEBED.

3. **Dependence on Ground-truth Assumptions**: Although the paper reports significant findings, the effectiveness of LEBED is contingent on the assumption that the class label space remains consistent between training and testing. It should be clarified how well the method can generalize to scenarios where such consistency does not hold.

4. **Citation of Relevant Work**: The paper fails to adequately cite related research on GNN evaluation methods, such as those by Walters et al. (2024), which could further contextualize the contributions. Including such citations might enrich the discussion on the novelty and significance of the proposed metric.

### Conclusion

Overall, this paper presents a meaningful advancement in the field of GNNs by tackling the crucial problem of evaluating model performance under practical deployment conditions. The introduction of the LEBED score is commendable, and the experimental validation provides a good foundation for further exploration. However, future iterations of this work could benefit from clearer explanations, broader comparisons with existing approaches, and a more explicit discussion of the conditions under which the proposed methods maintain accuracy.
