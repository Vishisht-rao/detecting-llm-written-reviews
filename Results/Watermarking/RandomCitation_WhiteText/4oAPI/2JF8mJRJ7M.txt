**Review of the Paper: "LIPSUM-FT: Robust Fine-Tuning of Zero-Shot Models Using Random Text Guidance"**

**Summary**  
The authors present "Lipsum-FT", a new robust fine-tuning method for zero-shot vision-language models, specifically focusing on enhancing the models' robustness against distribution shifts that typically occur post-fine-tuning. The paper articulates the performance trade-off observed with standard fine-tuning practices, wherein improvements on reference data lead to a decline in performance on shifted data distributions. The authors argue that existing methods in the literature have not adequately leveraged the language modeling component inherent in vision-language models. Through extensive experimentation across various datasets (DomainNet and ImageNet), the authors demonstrate that Lipsum-FT consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art robust fine-tuning methods, while effectively utilizing random text as guidance.

**Strengths**  
1. **Novel Contribution**: The introduction of Lipsum-FT represents a significant advancement in the domain of robust fine-tuning for vision-language models. The novel approach of utilizing random text guidance to mitigate changes in the energy gap between fine-tuned and zero-shot models is innovative.

2. **Comprehensive Experimental Validation**: The authors perform extensive evaluations across multiple datasets and rigorous benchmarking against existing methodologies. The use of varied distribution shifts further enhances the credibility of their findings and claims.

3. **Clear Theoretical Framework**: The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation for Lipsum-FT, contextualizing the energy-based model perspective in light of robustness and feature distortion theory. This conceptual clarity aids in understanding the underlying mechanics of the proposed method.

4. **Effective Problem Addressing**: The authors effectively address a critical gap in current methodologies by demonstrating the need for robust fine-tuning that considers both image and language modalities—this is a vital aspect given the multimodal nature of CLIP-like models.

**Weaknesses**  
1. **Insufficient Clarification on Key Assumptions**: The paper does not adequately clarify the assumptions or limitations related to the generation of random text used during training. It would be beneficial to discuss potential biases introduced by the specific random text sampling method and its implications for robustness.

2. **Details on Hyperparameters**: While the paper discusses hyperparameters such as the number of random tokens and their length, the effects of these choices on model performance are somewhat underexplored. An in-depth analysis of how different hyperparameter configurations influence the outcome would enhance the paper’s comprehensiveness.

3. **Ablation Studies**: Though the paper includes varying results for different configurations, the ablation studies could have been more extensive to validate the crucial role of the random text guidance more explicitly. Providing additional configurations or comparisons with other types of text guidance could add further depth to the evaluation.

4. **Citation of Related Work**: The paper could improve its context and grounding by referring to more recent and relevant studies, such as "Hatfield et al. (2022)", which discuss distribution shift implications in fine-tuning language models.

**Conclusion**  
Overall, the paper presents a well-researched and timely contribution to the literature on robust fine-tuning for zero-shot vision-language models. Lipsum-FT has the potential to influence future research in the area due to its practical applications and advancements over existing techniques. Addressing the noted weaknesses and expanding on the discussed areas would further strengthen the manuscript and its impact on the field. 

**Rating**: I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
