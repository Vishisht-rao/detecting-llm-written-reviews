### Review of the Paper "Proving Testset Contamination in Black Box Language Models"

#### Summary
The paper presents a novel approach to detecting test set contamination in large language models (LLMs) without needing access to their training data or weights. By leveraging the concept of exchangeability in datasets, the authors develop a statistical test that can identify instances where a model has potentially memorized examples from a benchmark dataset. They validate this approach through empirical experiments on both controlled "canary" datasets and popular publicly accessible language models.

#### Strengths
1. **Innovative Methodology**: The authors propose a significant advancement in the study of dataset contamination by utilizing exchangeability as a cornerstone for their detection method. This is a critical consideration that has been under-explored in the literature on LLMs.

2. **Statistical Rigor**: The paper provides a well-founded statistical framework for testing contamination and includes provable guarantees on false positive rates. This rigorous approach enhances the credibility and reliability of the proposed method.

3. **Practical Application**: The authors demonstrate the applicability of their tests to various models, indicating their methodâ€™s robustness in real-world scenarios. Their findings suggest that little evidence of pervasive contamination exists in widely used models, which adds to the current understanding of LLM performance.

4. **Empirical Validation**: Extensive experiments on both synthetic "canary" datasets and real-world models (e.g., LLaMA2, Mistral-7B) support their claims. The results effectively showcase the sensitivity of their method against varying duplication rates of inserted test sets.

5. **Contribution to the Field**: The work addresses an important aspect of LLM evaluation that has significant implications for trust and transparency in AI systems. By providing a benchmark with pretrained models for testing, the authors pave the way for further academic inquiry into detection methods.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Dependence on Exchangeability**: The methodology hinges on the assumption that datasets are exchangeable. In practice, this assumption may not always hold true, particularly for real-world datasets that often contain inherent ordering or structural information that could bias results.

2. **Limitation on Duplication Rates**: While the authors claim their method can identify contamination at low duplication counts, they acknowledge challenges in reliably detecting instances with a duplication rate of 1. This limitation should be more explicitly discussed, considering its implications for practical applications.

3. **Multiple Testing Concerns**: The authors do not apply corrections for multiple hypothesis testing in their experiments. Although they note the difficulty in defining the total number of tests performed, this omission could lead to inflated type I error rates, necessitating caution when interpreting the results.

4. **Anecdotal Evidence**: The results regarding other models, such as the low p-value obtained for the Mistral model, are treated with caution in the context of statistical significance. A more thorough analysis of how to interpret these borderline cases could enhance the reader's understanding.

5. **Citation of Future Work**: The paper mentions and cites various studies and emerging methodologies but could benefit from acknowledging potential criticisms or limitations in the cited works more substantively, particularly regarding their own methodological comparisons.

#### Suggestions for Improvement
- Address the robustness of the exchangeability assumption, potentially by including a discussion on how non-exchangeability could impact their results.
- Provide further insights into the limitations of detection at low duplication rates, and discuss strategies that future research may adopt to overcome these barriers.
- Consider integrating adjustments for multiple testing to enhance the rigor of empirical findings and the robustness of conclusions drawn from the data analysis.
- Expand on the implications of borderline p-values in their results to provide clearer guidance on interpreting findings.

#### Conclusion
This paper makes a commendable contribution to the understanding of test set contamination in language models. The authors' innovative approach and thorough evaluations represent a solid step toward improving transparency and reliability in AI. Nevertheless, addressing the highlighted weaknesses and building upon their foundation will be crucial for future advancements in this domain. The work encourages ongoing exploration of contamination detection methods, especially in light of shrinking access to training data in proprietary models. 

**Overall rating:** Strong acceptance potential, with minor revisions suggested. 

**Note:** A reference to an upcoming work, "Allen et al. (2024)," is cited, which could be relevant for future discussions in the field.
