**Review of "Subtractive Mixture Models via Squaring: Representation and Learning"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel approach for representing and learning subtractive mixture models (NMMs) through a squaring technique within the framework of probabilistic circuits (PCs). The authors argue that allowing mixtures to subtract probability mass leads to more efficient modeling of complex distributions, reducing the number of components needed. They offer theoretical results asserting that their squared NMMs (NPC2s) can be exponentially more expressive than traditional additive mixtures while ensuring non-negativity.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty and Theoretical Contributions:** The concept of subtractive mixtures through squaring is intriguing and represents a significant advancement in the realm of probabilistic modeling. The theoretical proofs supporting the exponential expressive power of NPC2s over traditional mixtures underscore the paper's contributions to the field.
   
2. **Elaboration on Probabilistic Circuits:** The integration of NPC2s into the existing framework of PCs is well-articulated, providing clarity on how traditional models can be extended to accommodate non-monotonic behaviors. This contextualization enhances the research's relevance.

3. **Empirical Validation:** The paper includes comprehensive empirical evaluations across various datasets to demonstrate the superiority of NPC2s in distribution estimation tasks compared to both monotonic PCs and their squared counterparts. The results substantiate the theoretical claims and showcase practical applicability.

4. **Illustrative Experiments:** The experimental setup is well-detailed, with a variety of configurations and comparisons, which can aid in reproducibility and extendibility of the research.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity:** While the paper does a commendable job discussing the technical aspects of NPC2s, some portions may be overly complex for readers unfamiliar with the background on probabilistic circuits and squaring mechanisms. Expanding the discussion on foundational concepts could improve accessibility.

2. **Generalization to Real-World Applications:** Although empirical results are promising, the authors could enhance their discussion on the generalizability of NPC2s to different domains and applications beyond those presented. Addressing this could solidify their claims about the utility of NPC2s in real-world scenarios.

3. **Potential Overfitting Concerns:** The paper would benefit from a discussion or analysis related to overfitting, particularly given that NPC2s can leverage complex input structures. Empirical results suggest superior performance, but it would be useful to address how model complexity is managed.

4. **Limited Comparative Analysis:** The paper compares NPC2s primarily with monotonic PCs. While this is a valid comparison, including benchmark comparisons with other contemporary models could provide a broader contextual understanding of NPC2s' competitive landscape.

**Minor Comments:**
- The paper cites "Morris et al. (2024)," but no such reference appears in the references list. It is vital to ensure all citations correspond to published works or provide an explanation for any in-progress work.
- Consider revising the notation for clarity, where it sometimes veers into the complex without sufficient introduction or explanation, particularly when addressing different parameterizations.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper contributes a noteworthy advancement in the study of mixture models by introducing a robust framework for subtractive mixtures via squaring. The theoretical and empirical results presented provide a strong foundation for further exploration and application of NPC2s. With minor revisions to enhance clarity and depth, the work has the potential to significantly impact the fields of probabilistic modeling and machine learning. I recommend this paper for acceptance with the noted considerations addressed.
