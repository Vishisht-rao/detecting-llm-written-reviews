**Review of "Non-Asymptotic Analysis of Stochastic Gradient Descent Under Local Differential Privacy Guarantee"**

**Summary**:  
The paper presents a detailed non-asymptotic analysis of Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) tailored to local differential privacy (LDP). The authors aim to address the theoretical gaps in understanding how users can specify different privacy budgets when training machine learning models. Their contributions include establishing upper bounds on the performance of DP-SGD under various conditions, providing guidelines on hyperparameter selections, and validating their theoretical findings with numerical experiments. They also propose a comparative analysis of the DP-SGD and Polyak-Ruppert Averaged SGD algorithms, highlighting the implications of privacy budgets on convergence rates.

**Strengths**:  
1. **Timeliness and Relevance**: The topic of differentially private machine learning is highly significant given the increasing concerns over data privacy. The focus on local differential privacy makes this paper particularly relevant for real-world applications where data cannot be centralized.
  
2. **Thorough Theoretical Framework**: The authors provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, establishing clear conditions under which their results hold. The use of non-asymptotic bounds is an important aspect, as it offers a practical understanding of the performance of the algorithms in finite sample settings, rather than in asymptotic limits.

3. **Clear Structure and Presentation**: The paper is well-organized, guiding the reader through the background, methodology, theoretical results, and experimental validation. The figures and numerical results support the theoretical claims effectively.

4. **Numerical Validation**: The extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed estimators and align with the theoretical results, strengthening the overall argument.

**Weaknesses**:
1. **Assumption of Smoothness**: The analysis heavily relies on the assumptions of smoothness and convexity in the loss functions. While these are common assumptions, the paper could benefit from addressing potential scenarios where these conditions may not hold. A discussion on the limitations of these assumptions could enhance the robustness of the findings.

2. **Experimental Scope**: Although the provided empirical validation is a strength, the experiments could be expanded to include a broader range of datasets and more complex loss functions, including non-differentiable objectives. This would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed methods.

3. **Citations and Comparison**: While the paper references relevant literature, it would benefit from discussing how its findings compare to existing work in local differential privacy, particularly with respect to the recent advancements in algorithms that tackle similar problems. The citation of "Torres et al. (2023)" appears to be out of place, as the referenced work has no apparent connection or context in the current narrative.

4. **Practical Guidelines**: The practical guidelines regarding the selection of hyperparameters are mentioned but could be elaborated upon with concrete examples, providing practitioners clearer insights on how to apply the findings in real-world scenarios.

**Conclusion**:  
Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of differentially private machine learning, particularly under the local differential privacy framework. The theoretical analysis and empirical validation support the claims made by the authors effectively. Addressing some of the weaknesses identified could further strengthen the impact of the work. I look forward to seeing it published, as it brings important insights that can influence future research and applications in privacy-preserving machine learning.
