**Review of "VTruST: Controllable Value Function Based Subset Selection for Data-Centric Trustworthy AI"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents VTruST, a novel framework aimed at enhancing the trustworthiness of AI systems through data-centric approaches. It enables users to control the trade-offs among various trustworthiness metrics such as explainability, fairness, and robustness by implementing an online value-function-based training data subset selection algorithm. VTruST employs a novel online-version of the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm tailored for the incremental nature of incoming data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that VTruST achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art baselines in terms of fairness and robustness across multiple datasets.

**Strengths:**

1. **Contribution to Trustworthy AI**: The approach addresses a critical problem in trustworthy AI by focusing on the quality of the training data rather than only the model architecture. This is particularly relevant as the AI community increasingly emphasizes the importance of trustworthy machine learning in high-stakes applications. 

2. **Online Algorithm**: The development of an online version of the OMP algorithm that efficiently selects subsets of training data shows innovative thinking and introduces practical applicability in scenarios where data arrives sequentially.

3. **Theoretical Foundations**: The authors provide comprehensive theoretical conditions enabling the recovery of sparse solutions, thus grounding the proposed methodologies in solid mathematical foundations. This adds to the trustworthiness of the algorithm from a theoretical standpoint.

4. **Empirical Validation**: Extensive experiments across diverse datasets convincingly illustrate the effectiveness of VTruST. The reported improvements in fair learning and robust training metrics validate the proposed approach and indicate practical relevance.

5. **User Control**: Allowing users to balance different trustworthiness metrics is an important practical aspect. This focus on user specifications offers flexibility for adaptivity in real-world applications.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity of Implementation**: The proposed method relies on sophisticated mathematical formulations and iterative algorithms. This may present implementation barriers for practitioners. The authors could consider elaborating on the practical aspects and potential pitfalls of implementing VTruST in real-world scenarios to enhance accessibility.

2. **Limited Comparison with Alternatives**: While the paper compares VTruST with several state-of-the-art methods, there is limited discussion on the computational efficiency of these algorithms. Benchmark results showing not just accuracy but also the runtime and computational demands would provide deeper insights into the trade-offs involved.

3. **Value Functions for Other Metrics**: The paper primarily focuses on fairness, robustness, and explainability. It would benefit from exploring the incorporation of other important trustworthiness aspects, such as privacy, which have been highlighted in the existing literature. For example, adapting the framework to include value functions for privacy loss might provide a more holistic approach to trustworthy AI.

4. **Citations of Previous Work**: The paper mentions contributions from various works; however, it would benefit from clearer attribution and a more comprehensive exploration of existing literature. Additionally, while referencing seminal work, it mistakenly cites "Bennett et al. (2020)" without context or relevance, suggesting a need for greater diligence in citation practices.

**Overall Impression:**
The paper presents an innovative and valuable contribution to the data-centric AI paradigm, successfully addressing the need for trustworthy AI through an effective subset selection framework. Although there are areas for improvement in practical applicability and comparative analysis, the robust theoretical framework and empirical validation support the potential utility of the proposed method in high-stakes settings. Overall, I recommend acceptance of this paper with minor revisions to improve clarity and address the highlighted concerns.
