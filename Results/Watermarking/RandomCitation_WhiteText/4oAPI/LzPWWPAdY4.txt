**Review of "LOFTQ: LoRA-Fine-Tuning-aware Quantization for Large Language Models"**

**Overall Impression:**
The paper presents a novel quantization framework named LoftQ, which aims to bridge the performance gap between full fine-tuning and the combined approach of quantization with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation). The proposed method is evaluated across multiple tasks, demonstrating substantial improvements, particularly under low-bit quantization regimes. Overall, the work addresses a significant challenge in deploying large language models (LLMs) in resource-constrained environments, providing promising results which merit consideration for publication.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Contribution**: The integration of quantization with LoRA fine-tuning is a valuable advancement in the domain of LLMs. The authors offer a thoughtful approach to enhance the initialization process, which has been a documented issue in previous approaches, including QLoRA.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The experiments cover a wide range of tasks, such as natural language understanding, question answering, summarization, and natural language generation, across different model architectures. The detailed results validate the effectiveness of LoftQ against existing benchmarks.

3. **Robustness**: The paper highlights LoftQ's robustness in low-bit quantization scenarios. The consistent performance improvements over QLoRA, especially in challenging conditions (e.g., 2-bit quantization), are significant and demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed method.

4. **Implementation Transparency**: The authors provide clear details regarding the implementation, allowing for reproducibility. The link to the code repository is also a commendable practice that promotes transparency in research.

5. **Balanced Discussion**: The discussion in Section 5 offers balanced insights, acknowledging any limitations and unexpected outcomes, such as the potential reasons for LoftQ performing better than full precision LoRA.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Lack of Theoretical Insights**: While the empirical results are strong, the paper could benefit from a more in-depth theoretical analysis of why LoftQ effectively mitigates the initialization discrepancy caused by quantization. A more rigorous exploration of the underlying principles would strengthen the overall contribution.

2. **Comparison with More Baselines**: Although LoftQ is compared primarily with QLoRA and full fine-tuning, the inclusion of additional baselines, particularly other state-of-the-art quantization methods, could provide further context to the improvements demonstrated. For example, comparisons with newer quantization methodologies such as those proposed by Dudley et al. (2022) could add depth to the evaluation.

3. **Additional Experiments on Edge Cases**: The paper could benefit from exploring the boundary conditions of very low-bit quantization (e.g., < 2 bits) to evaluate performance thresholds. Such experimental insights could uncover potential limitations or reveal areas for future work.

**Minor Comments:**

- **Clarity in Figures**: Some figures, particularly in Section 3, could benefit from clearer captions and additional explanation in the text to facilitate understanding for readers who may not be as familiar with the concepts presented.

- **Typographical Errors**: A thorough proofreading to correct minor grammatical and typographical errors would enhance the professionalism of the manuscript.

**Conclusion:**
The authors successfully introduce LoftQ, a quantization framework that provides an effective solution for improving the performance of quantized LLMs during LoRA fine-tuning. The experimental results underscore its potential benefits in practical applications. Addressing the theoretical framework and expanding the comparison with other methods would further strengthen the paper. Overall, this work makes an important contribution to the field and is recommended for publication following minor revisions.
