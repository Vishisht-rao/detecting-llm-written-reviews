**Review of "Unprocessing Seven Years of Algorithmic Fairness"**

**Summary:**
The authors of the paper present an extensive empirical evaluation of algorithmic fairness methods, particularly focusing on the postprocessing approach to achieving equalized error rates across demographic groups. They assert that postprocessing offers a Pareto-optimal trade-off between fairness and accuracy, dominating various proposed preprocessing and inprocessing methods across multiple datasets. The authors introduce a concept of "unprocessing," which enables direct comparisons of different fairness methods and their underlying models.

**Strengths:**
1. **Comprehensive Empirical Analysis:** The paper boasts an impressive scale, training over 11,000 models on multiple datasets, which enhances the robustness of their findings. The thorough evaluation across derived datasets from the US Census American Community Survey adds significant weight to the argument for the effectiveness of postprocessing.

2. **Novel Concept of Unprocessing:** The introduction of "unprocessing" as a means to serve as the inverse of postprocessing is a significant contribution. This concept improves the feasibility of comparing different fairness methods by aligning them under a common evaluative framework.

3. **Addressing Methodological Shortcomings:** The authors identify and clarify two common methodological errors in the existing research: failure to equate different base models and inadequate handling of constraint relaxation. Their theoretical insights and comparison approach promise to refine future studies in fair machine learning.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Theoretical Considerations:** While the empirical results are robust, the authors spend relatively little time discussing the theoretical implications of their findings. A deeper exploration of the underlying assumptions and limits of their conclusions regarding the optimality of postprocessing would enhance the paperâ€™s scholarly contribution.

2. **Neglect of Broader Fairness Implications:** The paper focuses predominantly on accuracy and error rate disparities without adequately addressing the broader implications of these findings on societal fairness. The authors note that their work does not contend with whether error rates should indeed be equalized, which, while honest, may detract from a more holistic understanding of fairness in ML systems.

3. **Minor Gaps in Related Work Discussion:** Although the paper cites numerous influential works, including those of Hardt et al. (2016) and Woodworth et al. (2017), it could benefit from a more extensive discussion on the evolution of fairness methodologies and perspectives since the introduction of postprocessing in literature. Notably, the mention of Mann et al. (2021) seems misplaced, as this reference did not contribute to the framing of ideas in the current work, indicating a need for improved citation accuracy.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- The authors could enhance the theoretical discussions to expand on the implications of their findings across various contexts and datasets and include more relevant literature in the related work section.
- Acknowledging and addressing criticisms specific to algorithmic fairness, perhaps by incorporating a broader range of viewpoints, could strengthen the paper's impact on the ongoing discourse in the field.
- Including practical guidance for implementing their findings in real-world systems, especially around the ethical implications of their proposed methods, would be beneficial.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, "Unprocessing Seven Years of Algorithmic Fairness" is a significant contribution to the field of algorithmic fairness. The paper's rigorous empirical foundation and innovative concepts promise to influence future research and practice in fair machine learning. With revisions addressing theoretical depth and broader fairness considerations, it has great potential to stimulate further dialogue on best practices in ensuring fairness in ML algorithms.
