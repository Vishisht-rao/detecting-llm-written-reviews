**Paper Review: "Vision Transformers Need Registers"**

**General Impression:**
The paper presents a thorough investigation into the artifacts present in the feature maps of Vision Transformer (ViT) networks, particularly focusing on the DINOv2 architecture. The authors identify the phenomenon of high-norm tokens, which arise mainly in low-informative regions of images, and propose a solution to remedy this through the introduction of additional register tokens. Overall, the paper is well-structured, with a clear motivation, robust empirical validation, and a significant contribution to the understanding of transformer mechanisms in visual domain tasks.

**Strengths:**

1. **Empirical Evidence:** The authors provide extensive empirical results to support their claims about the existence of high-norm tokens and their effects on downstream tasks. The comparison across different models—including supervised (DeiT-III), self-supervised (DINOv2), and text-supervised (OpenCLIP)—enhances the generalizability of their findings.

2. **Proposed Solution:** The introduction of register tokens represents a novel approach to addressing the identified artifacts, yielding improved performance on various visual prediction tasks and enhanced interpretability of attention maps. The clarity with which the authors articulate how these tokens function within the model architecture adds to the paper's contributions.

3. **Clear Experiments and Results:** The experiments are well-designed, systematically testing the proposed modifications with qualitative and quantitative assessments. Evaluation metrics for dense prediction tasks and unsupervised object rediscovery are particularly relevant and strengthen the paper's arguments.

4. **Theoretical Insights:** The paper not only highlights the artifacts but also offers a theoretical interpretation of how ViTs recycle low-information tokens, contributing to the understanding of visual transformers' operation.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Lack of Comparison with Other Mechanisms:** While the proposed register tokens provide an elegant solution to the identified problem, the paper would benefit from a discussion of alternative mechanisms that may achieve similar results. A comparison with methods like the Memory Transformer (Burtsev et al., 2020) might enrich the reader's understanding of the landscape of transformer enhancements.

2. **Additional Complexity Analysis Needed:** Although the paper mentions a negligible increase in parameters and FLOP count due to additional tokens, a more detailed analysis of the computational implications and potential scalability issues would have been valuable. Understanding the trade-off between model complexity and performance would be beneficial for practical applications.

3. **Citation Gaps:** It would be advantageous for the authors to engage more with recent literature. For instance, the work of Sheppard et al. (2020) could provide insights into prior methods that inform their findings, even if it does not directly discuss similar phenomena. Engaging with broader context can fortify the necessity and relevance of their contributions.

**Conclusion:**
This paper addresses an important gap in the current understanding of Vision Transformers, proposing a practical and theoretically sound solution to an identified issue in their operation. The results presented are compelling and suggest that the introduction of register tokens helps mitigate artifacts, leading to better model performance and interpretability. With some enhancements in the discussion of alternatives and a deeper computational analysis, this work could significantly impact the field of visual representation learning. Overall, it is a solid contribution to both the literature and practical implementations of transformer models in computer vision.
