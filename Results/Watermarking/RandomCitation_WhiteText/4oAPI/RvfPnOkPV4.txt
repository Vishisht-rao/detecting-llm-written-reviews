### Review of "WHAT’S IN MY BIG DATA?" by Elazar et al.

**Summary:**
The paper presents "WHAT’S IN MY BIG DATA?" (WIMBD), a comprehensive platform designed to analyze and document large-scale text corpora, which often serve as the foundation for training language models. The authors argue for the need for transparency in the content of these datasets, citing issues of quality, contamination, and ethical considerations like the presence of personally identifiable information (PII) and toxic language. WIMBD allows for extensive analysis across several dimensions, applying the framework to ten popular corpora, including C4, The Pile, and RedPajama. The findings reveal surprising levels of data duplication, toxicity, and evaluation benchmark contamination.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Framework:**
   - WIMBD introduces a novel tool that combines search and counting functionalities to enhance understanding and documentation of large text datasets. This dual capability enables systematic analyses that were previously difficult to achieve.

2. **Broad Analysis:**
   - The authors conduct thorough examinations of multiple datasets, providing 16 distinct analyses across four high-level categories that reveal significant insights into corpus characteristics. Their findings highlight critical issues that could impact model performance and societal implications.

3. **Open Science Initiative:**
   - The commitment to open-source WIMBD’s code and artifacts reflects the authors' dedication to promoting transparency and reproducibility within the field, encouraging further exploration and scrutiny of training datasets.

4. **Impact on Future Research:**
   - The results underscore issues of contamination and low-quality content in datasets, prompting a reevaluation of current practices in dataset creation and usage. This work paves the way for improved data curation methods that could lead to more ethical and effective AI systems.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Generalizability of Findings:**
   - While the analyses are comprehensive, the study is limited to datasets primarily in English. The authors might consider exploring non-English datasets as well to assess whether similar issues are prevalent across diverse linguistic corpora.

2. **Technical Limitations:**
   - The reliance on Elasticsearch for the search functionality, while powerful, has inherent limitations in terms of exact-match searching. The authors note this limitation and could enhance their framework by exploring fuzzy search capabilities in future iterations.

3. **Potential Overhead Costs:**
   - The computational costs associated with running the analyses on large datasets could pose barriers for practitioners without access to high-performance computing resources. Strategies to optimize these computational requirements could expand WIMBD’s usability in the community.

4. **Lack of User-Centric Evaluation:**
   - While the paper focuses on corpus analysis, it would benefit from including user studies or evaluations that assess how users interact with WIMBD and its impacts on model training and benchmarking.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, "WHAT’S IN MY BIG DATA?" is a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing and machine learning. The WIMBD platform provides essential tools for understanding and documenting the content of large-scale text corpora, addressing critical gaps in data transparency and analysis. The findings presented in the paper raise important considerations for future research and practices in the development of language models. Nonetheless, the authors should consider the limitations of their current analyses, particularly regarding language diversity and computational feasibility, while also seeking ways to enhance user engagement with the WIMBD platform.

**Recommendation:**
I recommend accepting the paper for presentation at ICLR 2024, with minor revisions to address the points raised in this review. The authors’ contributions to dataset analysis will undoubtedly benefit the wider machine learning community.
