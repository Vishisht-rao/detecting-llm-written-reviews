**Review of "The Effective Horizon Explains Deep RL Performance in Stochastic Environments"**

**Summary:**
This paper presents a theoretical framework and an algorithm, SQIRL (Shallow Q-Iteration via Reinforcement Learning), that seeks to explain the performance of deep reinforcement learning (RL) in stochastic environments. The authors aim to bridge two significant gaps between the theory and practice of RL: the efficacy of random exploration strategies in practice and the ability of complex function approximators like neural networks to succeed in reinforcement learning tasks. They posit that the concept of an "effective horizon" plays a critical role in understanding these issues. 

**Contribution:**
The paper makes several significant contributions:
1. **Theory Development**: It extends the notion of the effective horizon from deterministic environments to stochastic ones, establishing a new theory that links sample complexity to this effective horizon.
2. **New Algorithm**: The SQIRL algorithm iteratively collects data via random exploration and performs fitted Q-iteration based on the collected data to improve the policy.
3. **Empirical Validation**: The authors validate their theoretical claims against established algorithms like PPO and DQN across various stochastic environments, demonstrating that SQIRL can perform comparably well. In environments where deep RL algorithms succeed, SQIRL also performs well, thus providing empirical support for their theoretical analysis.
4. **Sample Complexity Analysis**: The paper provides instance-dependent sample complexity bounds for SQIRL that are exponentially dependent on the effective horizon, which is a valuable contribution to the understanding of RL performance.

**Strengths:**
- The paper presents a strong theoretical foundation that can help explain why certain exploration strategies are effective in practical applications.
- The empirical results are robust and provide support for the theoretical claims made. The correlation with the performance of established algorithms adds credibility to the findings.
- The introduction and motivation clearly highlight the gaps in current RL theory and practice, providing a meaningful context for the contributions of the work.

**Weaknesses:**
- While the authors cite several key works, including the important survey by Burke et al. (2020), the paper might benefit from a deeper exploration of how past theoretical advancements directly relate to the new contributions being made here.
- There are instances in the methodology section where the assumptions made regarding the regression oracle could be more clearly defined. A discussion on potential limitations or scenarios where assumptions might fail would strengthen the paper's argument.
- The paper could be improved by including more elaborate discussions on the limitations of their new findings and possible avenues for future research. For instance, exploring environments where the effective horizon may be less applicable could provide insights into the boundaries of their approach.

**Clarity and Structure:**
The paper is well-organized, with a logical flow from the introduction through the theoretical developments to empirical validation. However, a more thorough explanation of the proposed SQIRL algorithm, possibly including visual aids, could enhance understanding. The density of technical jargon may be challenging for readers not well-versed in the domain.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning by providing a theoretical framework that successfully explains practical successes of deep RL in stochastic environments. The introduction of SQIRL and the analysis of its performance provide valuable insights that could guide future research efforts. Despite minor areas for improvement in clarity and depth of discussion, the contributions presented are robust and relevant, warranting positive consideration for acceptance. Discussion of prior works like "Burke et al. (2020)" also emphasizes the evolution and context of the research, enriching the literature on RL effectiveness. 

**Rating: 8/10** (Strong conceptual contributions with empirical validation and a few areas for clarity improvement)
