### Review of "What Data Benefits MyClassifier? Enhancing Model Performance and Interpretability through Influence-Based Data Selection"

#### Summary
The paper entitled "What Data Benefits MyClassifier?" addresses the critical issue of data selection in enhancing the performance and interpretability of classification models. The authors propose a novel approach that leverages influence functions to assess the impact of individual training samples on the model's performance with respect to accuracy, fairness, and robustness. They develop influence estimation models based on tree methods to interpret the contributions of sample features and a data selection strategy that trims the dataset for improved outcomes. Extensive experiments across various synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the potential of their methods in different application scenarios, including distribution shifts and adversarial attacks.

#### Strengths
1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The work is particularly timely, addressing the often-overlooked aspect of dataset composition in machine learning, especially given the growing concerns about model fairness and robustness in practical applications.

2. **Methodological Rigor**: The authors employ influence functions, an established method in interpretability, in a new context focused on data selection. This methodological innovation is well-justified and highlights the potential for enhancing model performance through careful data curation.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The experimental design is robust, covering various scenarios including fairness poisoning attacks, distribution shifts, and online learning, which reflects the complexity of real-world applications. Results across multiple datasets support the claims made by the authors.

4. **Interpretability**: The focus on interpreting the influence of individual training samples through tree-based models adds a valuable layer of understanding, which is essential for practitioners looking to enhance model transparency.

5. **Practical Implications**: The work has significant potential utility in real-world applications, particularly in sensitive areas such as healthcare where data selection can drastically affect fairness and model integrity.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Limited Focus on Non-Convex Models**: While the paper does mention extensions to non-convex models, the focus remains primarily on convex models, which may limit its applicability in certain advanced machine learning contexts, particularly in deep learning.

2. **Computational Efficiency**: The authors acknowledge potential computational challenges with the influence function approach, especially for non-convex models. However, the discussion could be expanded to address ways to mitigate these issues or provide specific examples of the trade-offs involved.

3. **Ethical Considerations and Limitations**: While the ethics statement outlines positive contributions, it could better address the potential misuse of data selection strategies. For instance, how might adversaries exploit influence-based data selection for negative outcomes? More contemplation on these edges could enrich the ethics discussion.

4. **Baseline Comparisons**: The paper compares its methods primarily against random sampling and existing influence functions. Including a broader range of baselines, such as other data selection frameworks, could demonstrate the advantages of their approach more convincingly.

5. **Ambiguity in Contribution**: The paper cites prior work extensively, but at times it assumes familiarity with the complex landscape of data valuation and influence functions without sufficient context for readers unfamiliar with those concepts, potentially limiting accessibility.

#### Conclusion
Overall, the paper presents a compelling and well-researched contribution to the field of machine learning, focusing on the often-ignored aspect of data selection. It combines theoretical underpinnings and practical applications effectively, paving the way for further research in this domain. However, enhancing discussions regarding limitations, efficiency, and a broader range of baseline comparisons would strengthen the paper. I recommend its acceptance with minor revisions for clarity and depth in key areas.
