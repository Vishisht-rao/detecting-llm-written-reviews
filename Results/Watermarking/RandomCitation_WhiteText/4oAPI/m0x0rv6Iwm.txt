### Review of "TIME-VARYING PROPENSITY SCORE TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THE PAST AND PRESENT"

**Summary:**
The paper presents a thoughtful approach to addressing the challenges of model performance in the face of gradual shifts in data distributions, commonly encountered in real-world machine learning applications. The authors propose a time-varying propensity score (TVPS) to manage these data evolution scenarios by selectively sampling historical data that exhibits similar trends to the current distribution. The method spans various domains, including supervised learning and reinforcement learning, and provides an empirical evaluation of its efficacy through extensive experiments.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Approach**: The concept of a time-varying propensity score is innovative and could significantly enhance the adaptability of machine learning models to evolving data distributions. The idea of adjusting the weights of historical data based on its temporal relevance is a considerable improvement over traditional single-shift approaches.

2. **Versatile Applicability**: The proposed method's versatility across diverse problems—from image classification tasks to reinforcement learning scenarios—is commendable. This flexibility indicates the potential for broad applicability in various domains experiencing gradual data shifts.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The experiments conducted on synthetic data and established benchmark datasets (such as CIFAR-10 and CLEAR) are robust. The results clearly illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to various baselines, enhancing confidence in its utility.

4. **Theory and Formalization**: The theoretical underpinnings of the TVPS are well articulated, with mathematical formulations that lend credibility to the proposed approach. This foundation helps situate the research within the existing literature on handling distribution shifts.

5. **Clarity of Presentation**: The paper is well-organized and presents findings in a clear and coherent manner, making it accessible for readers with varying levels of expertise in this area.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Discussion on Assumptions**: While the paper emphasizes the effectiveness of the TVPS, it would benefit from a more intensive discussion on the assumptions underlying the modeling of gradual shifts in data. Specifically, the authors mention data evolving gradually but do not sufficiently address scenarios where abrupt changes might occur.

2. **Scalability Concerns**: The method’s dependence on a neural network for estimating the propensity score introduces computational overhead. The authors could discuss the scalability of their approach in terms of both model training and application, particularly when dealing with large datasets or real-time systems.

3. **Baseline Comparisons**: While various baseline methods are compared, the authors could include more recent approaches or techniques specifically designed for handling gradual shifts, thus enabling a clearer differentiation of their proposed method's performance.

4. **Error Analysis**: An analysis of the potential errors or limitations of the proposed method would provide a well-rounded perspective on its applicability. Understanding when the TVPS might underperform or encounter difficulties in specific contexts would benefit practitioners in selecting suitable models for their tasks.

5. **Omission of Related Works**: The paper could be enriched by discussing related works in more detail, particularly those that deal with concept drift or similar approaches employing propensity scores, enabling a better contextual understanding of the contributions made.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper introduces a promising method in the realm of machine learning for handling data distribution shifts over time. The time-varying propensity score holds significant potential for practical applications across various domains, particularly as machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into dynamic real-world environments. I recommend publication with minor revisions to address the noted weaknesses, especially concerning the assumptions and scalability of the proposed method. 

**Recommendation:** Accept with minor revisions.
