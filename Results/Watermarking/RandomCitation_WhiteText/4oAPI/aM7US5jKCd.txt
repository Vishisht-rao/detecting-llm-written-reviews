## Review of "Towards Reliable Evaluation and Fast Training of Robust Semantic Segmentation Models"

### Summary
This paper addresses a significant gap in the literature regarding the adversarial robustness of semantic segmentation models. While much work has been done on image classification, adversarial attacks tailored for semantic segmentation remain underexplored. The authors propose novel attacks and create an ensemble of these attacks, termed the Semantic Ensemble Attack (SEA), to evaluate the robustness of semantic segmentation models more reliably. Furthermore, they introduce a training method called Pre-trained ImageNet Robust Models AT (PIR-AT), which utilizes robust classifier backbones to improve the robustness of segmentation models while reducing training time.

### Contributions
1. **Novel Attacks**: The paper introduces new adversarial attacks specifically designed for semantic segmentation, addressing the unique challenges posed by the need to alter pixel-wise predictions.
   
2. **Evaluate Robustness**: The SEA serves as a more reliable method for assessing the robustness of semantic segmentation models compared to existing attacks, demonstrating that these models have been significantly overestimated in terms of robustness by prior standards.

3. **Efficient Training Strategy**: The introduction of PIR-AT illustrates a path to achieve state-of-the-art robustness in segmentation tasks while reducing training burdens.

### Strengths
- **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is well-structured, making it easy to follow the methodology and findings. The sections on the evaluation of adversarial robustness and the discussion of different loss functions are especially clear.
  
- **Empirical Results**: The experiments are comprehensive, comparing various attack methods and demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed SEA and PIR-AT methods. The use of multiple datasets (PASCAL-VOC, ADE20K) and architectures (UPerNet, PSPNet) enhances the robustness of the results.

- **Novel Contributions**: The introduction of complementary loss functions and their application to adversarial training fills a crucial gap in semantic segmentation. The proposed losses show empirical benefits over existing methods.

### Weaknesses
- **Limited Generalization of Attacks**: While the SEA is a step forward, it primarily focuses on just four specific loss functions. The authors should discuss the possibility of integrating other adversarial techniques or loss functions to further bolster the evaluation.

- **Reproducibility Concerns**: The paper mentions that code is not available, which may hinder reproducibility. This is an important aspect of research, particularly in adversarial machine learning where attacks can have complex implementations.

- **Black-box Attacks**: The authors acknowledge that SEA is designed for white-box attacks but largely leave the exploration of black-box attacks to future work. An initial discussion on potential extensions for black-box scenarios could add depth to the conclusion.

### Minor Points
- **References**: The authors may want to ensure that all citations are accurate. For instance, they cite "Novak et al. (2022)", but I could not identify this work in the reference list. This might be an oversight.

- **Broader Impact**: The discussion of the broader impact could be refined. While it recognizes potential misuse of these techniques, elaborating on strategies to mitigate such risks would provide a more balanced perspective.

### Conclusion
Overall, this paper makes substantial contributions to the field of robust semantic segmentation by clearly outlining the challenges, proposing novel solutions, and empirically validating their effectiveness. With some refinements, particularly regarding generalization and reproducibility, it holds significant promise for advancing research in adversarial robustness. I recommend acceptance of this paper, given its originality and relevance to current challenges in the field.
