**Review of "PILOT: A NO(1/K)-CONVERGENT APPROACH FOR POLICY EVALUATION WITH NONLINEAR FUNCTION APPROXIMATION"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents two novel algorithms, PILOT and an enhanced version PILOT+, aimed at solving the policy evaluation problem in reinforcement learning (RL) with nonlinear function approximation. The authors argue that existing algorithms exhibit inadequate convergence rates and high sample complexities when handling non-linear approximations, motivating the need for their approaches. The key contributions include achieving an O(1/K) convergence rate with constant step sizes and substantial improvements in sample efficiency through adaptive batch adjustments.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty and Theoretical Contributions:** The proposed methods, particularly the single-timescale PILOT with a variance-reduced framework, provide new insights into achieving fast convergence rates in non-convex optimization settings common in RL. The formulation of the convergence metric M(θ, ω) is particularly innovative and necessary for addressing challenges in existing variance-reduction methods.

2. **Empirical Validation:** The extensive numerical experiments underpinning the theoretical claims provide strong evidence of the PILOT and PILOT+ algorithms outperforming state-of-the-art methods, reinforcing the authors' claims about the efficiency and practicality of their implementations. 

3. **Comprehensive Literature Review:** The authors do a commendable job of situating their work within the existing literature, highlighting gaps in prior methods that their contributions aim to fill.

4. **Adaptive Batch Size Approach:** The enhancement in PILOT+ through the adaptive batch size to lower sample complexity is an excellent addition that is likely to appeal to researchers aiming to design more efficient RL algorithms.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Clarity and Depth in Proofs:** While the paper mentions new proof techniques and presents theoretical results, some aspects of the proofs could be elaborated upon. For readers unfamiliar with the convergence analyses employed, a more detailed exposition would be beneficial. Certain sections seem to assume a high level of familiarity with the concepts, which may limit accessibility to a broader audience.

2. **Limited Discussion on Practicality:** Although the paper presents an improved theoretical framework, the practical implications of implementing the algorithms in real-world scenarios (such as computation time and complexity of hyperparameter tuning) could be explored further. A discussion on robustness and parameter sensitivity would enhance the perceived utility of the proposed methods.

3. **Comparison with Other Algorithms:** While comparisons with state-of-the-art methods are made, the criteria for selection and the breadth of the comparison could be enhanced. Including more recent algorithms or those specifically designed for nonlinear function approximation would provide a more comprehensive benchmark.

**Additional Remarks:**
The paper succeeds in addressing a critical gap in policy evaluation for reinforcement learning, providing both theoretical and empirical advancements. However, the authors should ensure that practical applicability and implementation details are addressed more thoroughly to enhance the work's utility in applied settings.

In conclusion, "PILOT: A NO(1/K)-CONVERGENT APPROACH FOR POLICY EVALUATION WITH NONLINEAR FUNCTION APPROXIMATION" is a strong contribution to the field of reinforcement learning, and it is recommended for acceptance at the ICLR 2024 conference with minor revisions. Future versions should consider addressing the areas of clarity, practicality, and the breadth of algorithmic comparisons.
