**Review of the Paper "FROSTER: FROZEN CLIP IS A STRONG TEACHER FOR OPEN-VOCABULARY ACTION RECOGNITION"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents FROSTER, a novel framework designed to improve open-vocabulary action recognition by leveraging the strengths of the CLIP (Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pretraining) model. The authors identify key challenges when applying CLIP directly to action recognition tasks, particularly the lack of temporal information and the risk of overfitting during fine-tuning. FROSTER employs a residual feature distillation approach with a frozen CLIP model used as a teacher to maintain the model's generalizability while adapting to video-specific features.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Approach**: The introduction of a residual feature distillation method to balance the learning between generalizable and video-specific features offers an innovative perspective on knowledge transfer in the context of action recognition. This addresses a critical gap in the capabilities of existing models.
   
2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The extensive evaluation of FROSTER on multiple action recognition datasets and varying settings (base-to-novel and cross-dataset) demonstrates its versatility and effectiveness. The results show that FROSTER consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the proposed approach.
   
3. **Clear Presentation**: The paper is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas from motivation to method and results. Key concepts are clearly explained, which makes it accessible to readers who may not be intimately familiar with the topic.

4. **Figure Quality**: The figures and tables provide concise visual summaries of the results, facilitating easy assimilation of complex information. The attention visualization results effectively illustrate how FROSTER improves feature extraction relevant to actions.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Citations**: Although the authors discuss various methodologies and related works, the reference to "Stout et al. (2022)" appears to be misleading. This citation was not relevant to the core arguments presented in this work and could lead to confusion regarding its applicability. 

2. **Limited Discussion on Temporal Dynamics**: While the paper identifies challenges related to temporal information in CLIP, it could benefit from a deeper exploration of how FROSTER specifically accounts for temporal dynamics beyond simple action-based fine-tuning. A discussion on how different architectures or modifications could further enhance temporal understanding would strengthen the paper.

3. **Generalization Beyond CLIP**: The effectiveness of the FROSTER framework is primarily tied to the frozen CLIP model. The authors could enrich their discussion by considering the implications of their findings when applied to other foundational models or frameworks outside the CLIP family.

4. **Computational Efficiency**: The paper briefly mentions the computational burden associated with ensembling models. However, it would be beneficial to have a more comprehensive analysis of the efficiency of the proposed approach compared to existing methods in terms of both training and inference times.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, "FROSTER: FROZEN CLIP IS A STRONG TEACHER FOR OPEN-VOCABULARY ACTION RECOGNITION" presents a compelling and innovative methodology for action recognition in an open-vocabulary setting. The proposed framework not only addresses critical challenges associated with applying CLIP to video data but also demonstrates significant empirical success across several benchmarks. With a few improvements in clarity, discussion depth, and exploration of generalization beyond CLIP, this paper has the potential to make a lasting impact in the field of action recognition.

**Recommendation**: Accept with minor revisions.
