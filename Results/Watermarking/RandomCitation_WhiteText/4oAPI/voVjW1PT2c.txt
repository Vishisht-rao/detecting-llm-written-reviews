**Review of the Paper "GUARANTEED OUT-OF-DISTRIBUTION DETECTION WITH DIVERSE AUXILIARY SET"**

**Overview:**
The paper presents a compelling framework for improving out-of-distribution (OOD) detection by leveraging a more diverse set of auxiliary outliers through a method called Provable Mixup Outlier (ProMix). The authors provide both theoretical and empirical evidence supporting their approach, asserting that enhancing outlier diversity significantly bolsters the robustness of OOD detectors in real-world applications.

**Strengths:**

1. **Theoretical Contribution:** 
   - The paper establishes a rigorous theoretical framework analyzing the generalization errors associated with OOD detection using auxiliary outliers. The connection made between outlier diversity and reduced generalization error is notably well-articulated.
   - The use of generalization bounds to illustrate the effectiveness of diverse outliers represents a strong theoretical contribution that could pave the way for further research in the field.

2. **Experimental Validation:**
   - The authors conducted comprehensive experiments on standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100), demonstrating significant improvements in OOD detection metrics, including FPR95, AUROC, and AUPR. 
   - The comparative analysis against state-of-the-art methods and various configurations highlights the effectiveness of the ProMix method.
   - The ablation studies provide insight into the individual contributions of mixup and the greedy sampling approach, supporting the claims made regarding the necessity of these components in improving performance.

3. **Practical Application:**
   - The proposed solution addresses a critical problem in deploying machine learning models in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis. The focus on enhancing model reliability is timely and relevant.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Scope of Experiments:**
   - While the benchmarks used are standard in the domain, the paper could benefit from additional experiments on a wider variety of datasets, including more complex or unconstrained datasets beyond CIFAR, to further validate the robustness and scalability of the ProMix approach.

2. **Lack of Discussion on Limitations:**
   - The paper does not adequately discuss potential limitations or challenges associated with implementing the ProMix method in practical scenarios. For instance, the computational cost and efficiency of the mixup process during training could be elaborated upon.

3. **Reference to Related Work:**
   - The related work section is somewhat cursory. It could be enriched by including a comparative analysis with more recent techniques and methodologies in the field of OOD detection. In particular, discussing works such as "Robinson et al. (2022)" would place the proposed method in a broader context.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

- Including more diverse and challenging datasets for evaluation would strengthen the paperâ€™s claims about the generalizability of ProMix.
- A dedicated section addressing the limitations and potential drawbacks of the proposed method would enhance the paper's transparency.
- Elaborating on the implications of the findings for future OOD detection frameworks and providing insights into potential practical considerations would improve the overall impact of the research.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of OOD detection by thoroughly investigating the impact of auxiliary outlier diversity and proposing a novel strategy to enhance it. With some refinements in experimentation scope and discussion of limitations, this work is poised to influence ongoing research in making machine learning models safer and more reliable in real-world applications. I recommend the paper for acceptance with minor revisions.
