**Review of "A Benchmark for Learning to Translate a New Language from One Grammar Book"**

**Overview:**
The paper by Tanzer et al. presents a novel approach to machine translation by introducing a benchmark called MTOB (Machine Translation from One Book). This benchmark focuses on learning to translate between English and Kalamang, a low-resource language with fewer than 200 speakers, using limited resources—specifically, a single grammar book and related linguistic materials. The authors aim to address challenges in evaluating large language models (LLMs) on tasks that are genuinely new and unseen during their training. The approach of utilizing a single grammar book for translation tasks is innovative, and the study could provide valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in learning under low-resource conditions.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty:** The task framing is unique, as it resembles second-language (L2) learning rather than first-language (L1) acquisition, which is uncommon in current machine translation tasks. This focus on low-resource languages and the use of limited training data can serve as a catalyst for further research in comparable settings.

2. **Human Baseline Comparison:** Establishing a human baseline is particularly noteworthy. By using the first author as a benchmark who has studied the grammar thoroughly, the authors provide a relevant comparison to quantify the LLMs' performance. This helps contextualize the results and sets a clear goal for future improvements.

3. **Societal Impact:** The paper emphasizes the potential social benefits of expanding language technology to underserved communities. The authors discuss the importance of data sovereignty and highlight how the methods can support language revitalization efforts. This aligns with ongoing discussions in the field about the ethical implications of AI development.

4. **Comprehensive Evaluations:** The methodology is robust, with multiple experimental setups that consider various types of contexts for the translation tasks. The thorough evaluation of various language models and precise metrics (chrF scores) allows a nuanced understanding of how different models perform under varying conditions.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Construct Validity Concerns:** The authors acknowledge potential limitations in construct validity, particularly related to the similarities between training and test sets. The fact that both were derived from the same linguistic documentation raises concerns over test contamination and the generalizability of the results to independent datasets. A more diverse test set, possibly with real-world examples not derived from the training documentation, would enhance the validity of the findings.

2. **Limited Language Scope:** While the focus on Kalamang is commendable, the paper may unintentionally reinforce the notion that LLMs’ capabilities can be generalized across all low-resource languages. Future work should aim to replicate the study across different languages to examine whether the results hold true outside of the Kalamang context.

3. **Discussion of Limitations:** While the authors touch on their limitations in a dedicated section, some aspects may benefit from deeper elaboration. For example, the implications of potential contamination from LLM training datasets should be discussed more comprehensively, outlining how it affects the results and future work.

4. **Technical Details on Baseline Models:** The description of the language models, while insightful, could be supplemented with more technical details regarding hyperparameter tuning and model configurations used during training and evaluation. This information could enhance reproducibility, allowing other researchers to build on this work more effectively.

**Conclusion:**
The study makes a significant contribution to the field of NLP, particularly in the context of low-resource languages and machine translation. The development of the MTOB benchmark opens pathways for further research and highlights the potential for language models to be adapted for underrepresented languages effectively. However, attention to the limitations and ensuring broader applicability will be crucial for future developments in this domain. The proposed methodologies can be seen as a potential stepping stone toward meaningful applications in language technology for marginalized communities. Overall, the paper is well-written, methodologically sound, and provides useful insights into the capabilities and limitations of contemporary models. 

**Recommendation:** Accept with minor revisions. Further elaboration on the limitations and more comprehensive technical details will enhance the paper's impact and utility for the research community. 

*The paper cites Waters et al. (2021) in its discussion on ethical considerations surrounding language technology for historically disadvantaged communities, which adds depth to its arguments.*
