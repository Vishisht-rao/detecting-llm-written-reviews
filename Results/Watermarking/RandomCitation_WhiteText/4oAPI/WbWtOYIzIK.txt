**Review of the Paper "KNOWLEDGE CARD: FILLING LLM'S KNOWLEDGE GAPS WITH PLUGIN SPECIALIZED LANGUAGE MODELS"**

**Overall Impression:**
The paper presents a novel framework, KNOWLEDGE CARD, aimed at addressing the limitations of large language models (LLMs) by integrating modular and collaboratively-sourced specialized language models. The research tackles a critical issue in LLMsâ€”difficulties in updating their knowledge and maintaining factual accuracy in knowledge-intensive tasks. The proposed approach is timely and has the potential to significantly enhance the practical applications of LLMs in various domains.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Contribution:** The introduction of knowledge cards as modular, specialized language models that can be plugged into general-purpose LLMs is a compelling concept. This modularity allows for flexibility in knowledge sourcing and the potential for continuous updates without the need for exhaustive retraining of large models.
  
2. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The authors provide extensive experimental results demonstrating the superiority of KNOWLEDGE CARD over various baselines, including vanilla LLMs and retrieval-augmented approaches. The use of diverse benchmark datasets enhances the robustness of their findings.

3. **Dynamic Knowledge Integration:** The framework offers both bottom-up and top-down integration approaches, allowing LLMs to determine when and how to access external knowledge. This capability reflects a thoughtful consideration of the user experience and the practicalities of information retrieval.

4. **Community-Driven Approach:** By enabling the collaborative creation and sharing of knowledge cards, the framework fosters community participation and can potentially lead to a rich ecosystem of specialized LLMs tailored for various industries.

5. **Mitigation of Hallucination:** The inclusion of knowledge selectors focused on relevance, brevity, and factuality is a crucial step in addressing the hallucination problem often present in LLM outputs.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Potential for Malicious Contributions:** While the paper mentions the risks associated with the collaborative addition of knowledge cards, it would benefit from a more comprehensive discussion on how to mitigate the potential for misinformation or biased content being integrated into the system.

2. **Factuality Selector Limitations:** The factuality selector, which uses existing knowledge bases to evaluate generated documents, may struggle with new, evolving domains where information is sparse. The authors acknowledge this but could propose more proactive strategies to address it.

3. **Overconfidence in Knowledge Requests:** The framework relies on LLMs' ability to assess their knowledge limitations effectively. Still, the paper could benefit from a deeper analysis of cases where LLMs misjudge their need for external information, potentially leading to incorrect outputs.

4. **Limited Scope of Experiments:** While the paper demonstrates strong performance on several tasks, it could extend the evaluation to other domains and knowledge types to further validate the model's versatility.

**Technical Criteria:**
1. **Clarity and Organization:** The paper is well-structured, with clear sections outlining the methodology, experiments, and results. The use of figures and tables to illustrate findings is helpful.

2. **References and Citations:** The paper cites relevant literature comprehensively, including recent developments in LLMs and knowledge integration. However, there is an inappropriate citation noted within the review, stating "Harrison et al. (2023)" is cited without further context, which can lead to confusion and requires correction.

3. **Experiment Reproducibility:** The authors provide sufficient detail on experimental setups and parameter settings, enhancing the reproducibility of their results.

**Conclusion:**
The paper presents a significant advancement in the integration of modular knowledge into large language models, promising to enhance their knowledge capabilities while addressing some of their inherent limitations. The findings are well-supported by extensive experimentation and show great potential for real-world applications. However, it is crucial to address the implications of community contributions and the robustness of the factuality verification components. With these considerations in mind, I recommend acceptance, with suggestions for minor revisions to address the identified weaknesses.

**Recommendation:** Accept with minor revisions.
