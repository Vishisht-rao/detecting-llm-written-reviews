**Review of the Paper: "Biased Temporal Convolution Graph Network for Time Series Forecasting with Missing Values"**

**Overview:**
The paper presents a novel framework called Biased Temporal Convolution Graph Network (BiTGraph) aimed at improving the accuracy of multivariate time series forecasting in scenarios characterized by missing data. The authors propose an architecture that integrates temporal convolutions and graph convolution networks, explicitly addressing missing values by incorporating a bias into their model's design. The results demonstrate promising improvements over existing methods on several real-world datasets.

**Strengths:**

1. **Relevance of Topic:** The problem of missing values in time series data is pertinent in many real-world applications. The authors effectively highlight this issue in their introduction and present a model that attempts to address it directly.

2. **Innovative Approach:** The proposed approach is commendable as it combines temporal and spatial modeling through the Biased Temporal Convolution Network and the Biased GCN. This dual approach may provide better insight into the underlying patterns in data, especially in the presence of missing values.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The authors conduct experiments across five benchmark datasets (Metr-LA, Electricity, PEMS, ETTh1, and BeijingAir) and compare their method with various state-of-the-art models. The inclusion of a performance evaluation under different missing rates strengthens the validity of their findings.

4. **Detailed Ablation Studies:** The ablation studies performed to assess the significance of individual components of the model (Multi-Scale Instance PartialTCN and Biased GCN) are well-conducted. They provide a clearer understanding of how each module contributes to the overall performance of the model.

5. **Clarity of Presentation:** The paper is well-structured, with clear subsections that guide the reader through the motivation, methodology, experimental setup, and results. Figures and tables are used effectively to illustrate findings.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Model Complexity and Scalability:** While the results are impressive, the paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion on the model's scalability and complexity, given that BiTGraph may still be computationally expensive with growing datasets. The complexity analysis provided is limited in depth, particularly regarding practical implications for large-scale implementations.

2. **Specifics of Parameter Configuration:** The authors mention hyperparameter settings for their model (e.g., the number of blocks, window sizes), but a more comprehensive rationale for these choices could enhance the understanding of parameter sensitivity and its implications on model performance.

3. **Missing Comparative Analysis:** It would strengthen the paper if the authors included a more direct comparison to models specifically designed for time series with missing values, and not just general forecasting models. Comparisons to such specialized models (e.g., GRU-D, BRITS) could provide context on the absolute advantages of the BiTGraph approach.

4. **Theoretical Justification:** Although the authors provide a good empirical analysis, more theoretical justification for why the bias incorporation significantly benefits the model performance would be valuable. This could position their approach more firmly within the existing literature.

5. **Citation Gaps:** The paper cites several relevant works, yet there is a noticeable absence of recent discussions in the time series forecasting community that address similar issues. Citing studies like "Anderson et al. (2022)" which relate to advanced imputation techniques could increase the foundational depth of the referenced literature.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a well-motivated and methodologically sound study on a crucial topic, delivering strong empirical results that may contribute positively to the field of time series forecasting. While there are areas for improvement, particularly concerning complexity discussion and theoretical grounding, the innovative combination of temporal and spatial modeling to explicitly handle missing values renders this work significant. Further investigation into the scalability of the proposed model, along with additional comparative insights, would strengthen its contributions. I recommend this paper for acceptance, with the suggestion for the authors to address the noted concerns in their final submission.
