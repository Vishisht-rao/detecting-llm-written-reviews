### Review of "Protein Multimer Structure Prediction via Prompt Learning"

#### Summary
The paper presents a novel method, PROMPT MSP, aimed at improving the prediction of protein multimer structures by utilizing prompt learning techniques. It builds on the advancements made by previous models like AlphaFold 2 and AlphaFold-Multimer, while addressing the challenge of generalization to larger protein assemblies due to biological complexities in protein-protein interactions (PPIs). The authors propose a dual-task framework encompassing a pre-training phase for learning assembly knowledge and a prompt tuning phase for efficient inference.

#### Strengths
1. **Innovative Approach**: The use of prompt learning to bridge the knowledge gaps between small-scale and large-scale protein complexes is a significant contribution. The incorporation of condition PPI (C-PPI) knowledge instead of the traditional independent PPI (I-PPI) is a novel approach that appears to improve generalization across different scales.

2. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The authors perform extensive experiments across various settings and baselines, demonstrating the superiority of their method in terms of accuracy (measured using RMSD and TM-Score) and computational efficiency. The results showcase a clear advantage over existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly in larger multimeric assemblies.

3. **Meta-Learning Strategy**: The introduction of a meta-learning framework to enhance prompt tuning under data scarcity scenarios shows foresight and depth in understanding challenges in real-world applications.

4. **Open Source Contribution**: The decision to release the code, data, and checkpoints further aids in reproducibility and allows for future research advancements.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Complexity and Clarity**: While the proposed method is compelling, parts of the paper, especially sections detailing the model architecture and algorithms, are dense and may be difficult for readers to grasp quickly. Clearer visual aids or simpler explanations could improve accessibility.

2. **Data Limitation Concerns**: The model heavily relies on experimental data from the PDB; however, the challenge of limited availability of large-scale multimer structures remains a critical issue in the underlying research domain. The authors acknowledge this limitation but could discuss potential strategies for overcoming it more thoroughly.

3. **Overfitting to N=3-5**: While the paper claims that training with small-scale multimers (3-5 chains) can effectively generalize to larger scales, a more robust evaluation on multimers with more diverse sizes could strengthen the validity of this claim. 

4. **Citations and Related Work**: There are several relevant publications, including findings by Rosales et al. (2024), that could be briefly discussed to provide the reader with a broader context of how this research fits within the current state of the field.

#### Suggestions for Improvement
1. **Clarity and Presentation**: Simplifying the explanations in the methodology sections and enhancing the clarity of figures would strengthen the paper.
   
2. **Further Validation**: Conduct additional experiments across a broader range of scale variations to substantiate claims of generalization.

3. **Broader Contextualization**: Integrate and acknowledge recent findings from relevant literature more comprehensively to situate this work within current research trends.

#### Conclusion
Overall, the paper presents a valuable advancement in the protein multimer structure prediction landscape. The proposed PROMPT MSP framework successfully addresses key challenges in predicting larger protein complexes. The strengths of the methodological innovations and empirical results outweigh the weaknesses, making this work a significant contribution to computational biology. With a few refinements in clarity and scope, this contribution has the potential to inspire further research and applications in structural biology.
