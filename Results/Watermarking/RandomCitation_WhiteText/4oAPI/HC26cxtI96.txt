**Review of "FUSPLACE: THE FINE-GRAINED CHIP PLACEMENT WITH HYBRID ACTION SPACES AND FEATURE FUSION"**

**Summary:**
The paper proposes Fusplace, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed to enhance the chip placement process in Electronic Design Automation (EDA). The authors aim to overcome limitations in existing methodologies by addressing issues related to representation redundancy and the imprecise nature of traditional action spaces in RL applications. They introduce a hybrid action structure known as Parameterized Deep Q-Networks (P-DQN) and a feature fusion approach that separates netlist information into local and global components to improve interpretability and accuracy in chip placement.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach**: The proposed hybrid action space and feature fusion representation are well-motivated approaches to addressing the longstanding challenges in chip placement. The integration of local and global information for more accurate feature extraction is commendable.
  
2. **Timely Topic**: Advancements in chip design, particularly in the face of increasing complexity and demand, are critical to the EDA community. The ongoing evolution of methods combining traditional optimization techniques with deep learning and reinforcement learning is both relevant and necessary.

3. **Clear Objectives**: The paper delineates clear goals, such as precision in chip placement and avoidance of component overlaps, making it easy for readers to grasp the significance of the proposed methods.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Lack of Drop in Performance Metrics**: While the paper claims improvements over existing methods, there is not sufficient detail about comparative performance metrics. The authors should present quantitative results that demonstrate the superiority of Fusplace over benchmark algorithms in terms of speed, accuracy, and any other relevant metrics.

2. **Implementation Details**: The paper would benefit from more details regarding implementation. For instance, specific choices of hyperparameters in the RL training process and their impact on the model's learning would enhance reproducibility and provide insights for practitioners.

3. **References and Citations**: The manuscript lists relevant literature to situate Fusplace in the landscape of existing approaches. However, it mentions "Silva et al. (2020)" without providing context, which can confuse readers. All citations should be clear and properly integrated within the text.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. **More Detailed Experiments**: Include experiments comparing Fusplace against a wider range of existing methods, particularly analytical algorithms and other recent RL-based approaches. Displaying performance graphs and discussing the significance of results would strengthen the claims of efficacy.

2. **Clarification of the Learning Process**: Provide information on the RL training process, such as exploration strategies employed during training, convergence criteria, and evaluation methods.

3. **Revision of the Related Work Section**: A more comprehensive discussion of related work can help highlight how Fusplace distinguishes itself from prior research in both its methodology and outcomes.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents an innovative approach to a fundamental problem in chip placement that is both timely and relevant. With further refinement and validation, particularly through comparative analysis and detailed implementation strategies, the contributions made by the authors could significantly advance research in this area. I commend their efforts and look forward to seeing how this work evolves in future iterations.
