## Review of "Improving Offline RL by Blending Heuristics"

### Summary

The paper presents a novel technique called Heuristic Blending (HUBL) aimed at enhancing the performance of offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that utilize value bootstrapping. HUBL seeks to address the common issue of performance inconsistency among various offline RL algorithms by blending heuristic values, estimated through Monte-Carlo returns, into the Bellman operators of the existing algorithms. The authors substantiate their claims both theoretically and empirically, showing that HUBL can improve the policy quality of four prominent offline RL algorithms—CQL, TD3+BC, IQL, and ATAC—by an average of 9% across 27 datasets from standard benchmarks. 

### Strengths

1. **Novel Approach**: The concept of blending heuristics into bootstrapping-based algorithms is innovative and may provide a new direction for improving offline RL, especially in tackling performance inconsistency seen in existing methods.
   
2. **Theoretical Insights**: The paper provides a well-structured theoretical framework that explains HUBL's performance improvement through a bias-regret trade-off. This is a valuable contribution to the field, as it offers a deeper understanding of how heuristics can interact with bootstrapping in offline settings.

3. **Empirical Validation**: The authors present comprehensive empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of HUBL across various datasets, showcasing significant performance gains in scenarios where conventional offline RL methods underperform.

4. **Implementation Simplicity**: The ease of integrating HUBL with existing algorithms is likely to facilitate its adoption in practical applications, as it merely requires relabeling the datasets with adjusted rewards and discount factors.

5. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The experimental section covers a diverse range of environments and presents an ablation study that assesses various parameter settings, which adds robustness to their findings.

### Weaknesses

1. **Dependencies on Heuristic Quality**: The performance of HUBL heavily relies on the quality of the heuristic estimates. In practical scenarios with noisy or biased data, this could limit the effectiveness of the proposed method. Further study on how to mitigate this limitation is needed.

2. **Limited Analysis on Dynamic Environments**: The primary focus on deterministic and low-dimensional environments in the experiments puts into question HUBL's efficacy in more complex, real-world settings where stochasticity and high-dimensional states present additional challenges.

3. **Citation Anomaly**: The paper cites "Rose et al. (2022)" but does not provide a corresponding reference. This should be addressed for clarity and to uphold proper citation practices.

4. **Exploration of Heuristic Functions**: Although HUBL relies on Monte-Carlo returns for heuristic estimation, it may benefit from discussing and possibly evaluating other heuristic functions or methods for better empirical performance.

5. **Potential for Overfitting**: The authors should be cautious of over-tuning the blending factor λ, as this could lead to overfitting the model to the training datasets without generalizing well to unseen data.

### Conclusion

Overall, "Improving Offline RL by Blending Heuristics" delivers a significant contribution to the field of offline reinforcement learning by introducing a novel framework that demonstrates clear performance improvements and theoretical insight. While there are some aspects that require further investigation and refinement, especially regarding heuristic quality in complex environments, the positive results noted in the study suggest that HUBL may offer a valuable tool for future exploration in offline RL. The potential practical applications in domains where collecting new data is costly make this work particularly relevant. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the citation and heuristic considerations noted above.
