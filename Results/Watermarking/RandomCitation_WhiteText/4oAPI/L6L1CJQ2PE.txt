### Review of "MASSIVE EDITING FOR LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS"

The paper presents a novel approach called MAssive Language Model Editing Network (MALMEN) aimed at improving the efficiency and scalability of knowledge editing in large language models (LLMs). The authors identify critical weaknesses in existing hyper-network methods for model editing that limit their ability to handle multiple simultaneous edits effectively. The proposed solution applies a least squares optimization framework to aggregate parameter shifts and separates computation between a hyper-network and the language model to manage memory consumption.

#### Strengths

1. **Innovation**: The formulation of parameter shift aggregation as a least squares problem is a compelling approach to address the cancellation effect prevalent in existing methods. This mathematical insight could significantly enhance the editing capabilities of LLMs, potentially transforming the state of the art in model editing.

2. **Scalability**: The empirical results demonstrate that MALMEN can edit hundreds of times more facts than previous methods (e.g., MEND) while maintaining competitive performance across multiple models (BERT-base, GPT-2, T5-XL, and GPT-J). This scalability is crucial for real-world applications where large-scale editing is necessary.

3. **Thorough Evaluation**: The authors provide extensive evaluations, including a scaling curve analysis and ablation studies that underscore the strengths of their approach. The results indicate that MALMEN consistently outperforms existing methods like MEMIT in various tasks, showcasing its practical applicability.

4. **Code Availability**: The authors have made their code publicly available, which is a positive practice that facilitates reproducibility and encourages further research in this domain.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Generalization to Language Variants**: While the paper addresses several challenges in editing factual information, it notes that MALMEN still struggles with rephrasing and paraphrasing outputs. This limitation is significant because real-world usage often involves varied expressions of knowledge. Further exploration on improving this aspect could strengthen the paper.

2. **Theoretical Justification**: Although the authors present a compelling algorithmic framework, a deeper theoretical analysis could be beneficial. For instance, discussing the convergence properties of the least squares optimization in relation to model stability and long-term performance might provide added confidence in the method's robustness.

3. **Memory Comparisons**: The memory consumption comparisons are insightful; however, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of computational time alongside memory usage, particularly as model size increases. An explicit breakdown of time complexity concerning model size would clarify the practical limits of MALMEN.

4. **Related Work Discussion**: While the paper includes a comprehensive discussion of related works, it might benefit from a more critical evaluation of how MALMEN distinctly addresses the limitations highlighted in comparable studies, such as those by Wilcox et al. (2023). This would situate the contribution of MALMEN within the broader context of recent advancements in LLM editing.

#### Overall Impression

In conclusion, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing by presenting a robust solution for large language model editing that combines theoretical depth with practical applicability. The proposed MALMEN approach stands out for its scalability and efficiency, potentially opening avenues for future research and applications in dynamic knowledge management within LLMs. Addressing the identified weaknesses could further enhance the impact and usability of this work.

**Rating**: 8/10
