# Review of the Paper

## Title: *Improving Non-Transferable Representation Learning by Harnessing Content and Style*

### Summary
The paper presents a novel approach to non-transferable learning (NTL) by introducing a method called H-NTL that aims to improve the learning of non-transferable representations through the disentanglement of content and style factors based on a causal inference framework. The authors argue that existing statistical methods fail to adequately separate content and style, leading to fitting spurious correlations and achieving fake independence between labels and content. The proposed method utilizes variational inference to model unobservable latent factors for content and style separately and employs dual-path knowledge distillation to improve the efficacy of representation learning for both the source and target domains.

### Strengths
1. **Novel Approach**: The introduction of a causal model to differentiate between content and style factors is a significant advancement in the NTL field, addressing important limitations of prior methods.
2. **Thorough Evaluation**: The paper is well-structured and presents extensive empirical validation across various domains, showcasing the effectiveness of H-NTL compared to existing methodologies.
3. **Illustrative Examples**: The figures and examples, particularly those illustrating the NTL mechanism, effectively convey the issues encountered in existing approaches while highlighting the advantages of the proposed solution.
4. **Practical Applications**: The potential applications of H-NTL in intellectual property (IP) protection and controllable AI are timely and relevant, providing a strong motivation for the work.
5. **Extensive Related Work**: The related work section covers a wide range of pertinent literature, establishing a solid background for the need for advancements in NTL.

### Weaknesses
1. **Complexity and Training Efficiency**: While the dual-stage training process improves representation learning, it may also present challenges related to computational resource requirements and efficiency. Suggestions for enhancing training speed would be beneficial.
2. **Generalization of Findings**: The authors investigate performance on specific datasets without thoroughly addressing generalization to a broader set of contexts or real-world scenarios outside of their experimental conditions.
3. **Lack of Field Testing**: Empirical results, although promising, primarily rely on synthetic modifications (style augmentations). Real-world domain shifts and their implications for performance could potentially diverge from the presented findings, warranting further investigation.
4. **Omission of Negative Results**: The paper could benefit from a more critical discussion of potential drawbacks or failures of the proposed method, particularly under certain conditions or with specific data distributions.

### Minor Comments
- The paper should ensure clarity in describing technical terms (e.g., what constitutes "style factors" versus "content factors"), especially for readers new to the field.
- The reference to "Jacobs et al. (2023)" could be expanded upon to provide additional context for its relevance to this paper's methodology or findings.
- The algorithms presented in the appendices could be better summarized in the main text for clarity and to facilitate understanding for readers who might not delve into the supplementary sections.

### Conclusion
Overall, this paper addresses significant challenges within non-transferable representation learning and introduces a promising new method, H-NTL. The combination of causal models with variational inference and knowledge distillation presents a compelling approach to enhancing performance in NTL tasks. While the methodology is robust and experimental results are impressive, a more thorough examination of the approach's limitations and its applicability to diverse datasets and real-world scenarios would enhance the paper's contributions to the field. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the feedback provided.
