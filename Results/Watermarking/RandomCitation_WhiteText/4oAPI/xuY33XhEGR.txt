**Review of "CLIMODE: Climate and Weather Forecasting with Physics-Informed Neural ODEs"**

The paper proposes ClimODE, a novel spatiotemporal continuous-time approach to climate and weather forecasting, specifically utilizing physics-informed neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The authors aim to address deficiencies observed in traditional numerical simulations and recent deep learning models, specifically in their neglect of underlying physical laws and challenges related to uncertainty quantification. The setup and perspective provided by the authors offer a promising alternative to existing models in climate forecasting.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Framework**: The authors effectively combine insights from statistical mechanics and deep learning, implementing a continuous-time, second-order neural continuity equation to describe climate phenomena. This interdisciplinary approach is commendable, as it grounds the neural model in established scientific principles.

2. **Performance**: The experimental results demonstrate that ClimODE outperforms several state-of-the-art deep learning methods (like FourCastNet and ClimaX) across various metrics while maintaining a significantly smaller parameterization. This provides evidence for the model's enhanced efficiency and effectiveness in making predictions at both global and regional scales.

3. **Uncertainty Quantification**: The incorporation of a probabilistic model for emissions is a significant achievement. It addresses two major weaknesses observed in traditional models: the deterministic nature of predictions and the inability to quantify prediction uncertainties. This advancement may have practical implications for improved decision-making in climate-related tasks.

4. **Open Source Contribution**: The commitment to providing an open-source implementation allows for wider accessibility and reproducibility of research findings, encouraging further exploration and validation by the community.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity of the Model**: While the technical implementation of the neural ODEs and related methodologies is comprehensive, the model's complexity may pose challenges for broader adoption in the community. Simplifications or more intuitive explanations may be needed for practitioners less versed in advanced mathematical frameworks.

2. **Comparison with Baseline Models**: While ClimODE is shown to outperform other models, it is important to ensure that comparisons are conducted under identical conditions. The authors noted some limitations in association with PanguWeather and GraphCast due to code availability, which raises questions about the comprehensiveness of the benchmark evaluations.

3. **Assumptions and Limitations**: The paper acknowledges inherent limitations in applying the proposed method to long-term climate forecasting in light of climate change uncertainties. This is a crucial aspect that could be emphasized further, as it speaks to the practical applicability of the work.

4. **Citations and References**: The reference list would benefit from additional citations beyond the existing body, possibly including literature that directly challenges or critiques related methodologies, such as Whitaker et al. (2021). This would situate the work within the broader academic discourse more effectively.

**Overall Evaluation:**

In conclusion, "CLIMODE: Climate and Weather Forecasting with Physics-Informed Neural ODEs" presents a compelling and innovative approach to weather prediction through continuous-time modeling. The blend of physics and deep learning elucidates a path forward for advancements in this field, especially in the context of accuracy and uncertainty in forecasting. However, attention to the model's complexity and broader applicability is necessary for making the approach more accessible. The authors are encouraged to further discuss assumptions and limitations and enhance the literature review to encompass a wider range of perspectives. Despite these considerations, the paper has the potential to make a significant impact in climate and weather forecasting research.
