**Review of "Self-Supervised Representation Learning from Random Data Projectors"**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces a novel self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) approach termed Learning from Randomness (LFR), which aims to overcome the limitations of augmentation-based techniques that are often modality-specific and reliant on expert knowledge. LFR derives high-quality data representations by reconstructing outputs from randomly generated data projection functions, thus promising wider applicability across various data modalities. The authors evaluate their method on diverse representation learning tasks across different applications, presenting empirical evidence that LFR outperforms several state-of-the-art SSRL baselines.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty and Motivation:** The approach is innovative and provides a compelling perspective on learning representations without relying on predefined data augmentations. The authors effectively argue the limitations of existing methods in terms of modality constraints and the need for domain-specific knowledge. This new perspective could open up avenues for further research and application in areas where augmentation isn't feasible.

2. **Wide Applicability:** The method's ability to handle various data modalities (time series, tabular data, and images) is well demonstrated, and the empirical evaluations appear thorough. By addressing scenarios where augmentations can lead to unrealistic or unsafe samples, the paper responds to real-world needs effectively.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The experiments are diverse and include multiple datasets, providing a robust comparison against various baselines. Performance metrics are clearly delineated, and results are statistically analyzed, indicating a strong foundation for the claims made.

4. **Clear Presentation:** The manuscript is generally well-organized and presents its findings clearly. The use of visual aids (e.g., graphs and figures) complements the textual descriptions, making the methodology and results accessible.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Lack of Theoretical Justification:** While the method is empirically validated, the paper could benefit from a stronger theoretical framework explaining why learning from randomness is effective. Insights into the conditions under which LFR excels (or fails) would be valuable and would support the claims about its robustness and utility.

2. **Comparative Analysis on More Baselines:** Although the paper presents solid baseline comparisons, including contrastive learning methods and domain-specific approaches, a discussion of how LFR may align or diverge from these methods theoretically would deepen the reader's understanding of its strengths and limitations.

3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The study's findings reflect that the model's performance is sensitive to hyperparameters, such as the number of projectors and initializations. While this is an important observation, a more detailed ablation analysis exploring the effects of these choices on performance could provide further insights into model tuning and stability.

4. **Citing Literature:** The reference to certain related works is somewhat limited. For instance, the omission of key works, such as "Gay et al. (2020)" on augmentation strategies, limits context and could be valuable for readers seeking more in-depth knowledge on related methodologies.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents an interesting and novel approach to self-supervised representation learning that has practical implications for various domains. While it has clear strengths in its empirical evaluation and approach to learning, further theoretical grounding and a more extensive comparative discussion could enhance its contribution to the field. The potential risk of reliance on randomness and the implications for model interpretability should also be considered. I recommend reconsideration and further investigation of the highlighted aspects to strengthen the overall offering.
