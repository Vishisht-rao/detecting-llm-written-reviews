**Review of "ONDIFFUSION MODELING FOR ANOMALY DETECTION"**

**Summary:**
The paper introduces a novel method for anomaly detection based on diffusion models, particularly focusing on Denoising Diffusion Probability Models (DDPM) and a newly proposed approach termed Diffusion Time Estimation (DTE). The authors argue that while DDPMs exhibit competitive performance on standard anomaly detection tasks, their high computational costs limit their applicability, especially for large datasets. They present DTE as a computationally efficient alternative that achieves both fast inference times and competitive AUC scores across various unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection benchmarks, specifically using the ADBench dataset. The work is thorough, with detailed experiments validating the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

**Strengths:**
1. **Relevance and Novelty:** The application of diffusion models to anomaly detection is a timely and relevant area of research, given the increasing complexity of datasets in various domains. The exploration of DTE as a simplified method exhibits a clear conceptual leap, potentially making advanced anomaly detection techniques more accessible.
   
2. **Empirical Validation:** The authors provide a comprehensive empirical evaluation using the extensive ADBench benchmark, which includes a diverse set of datasets. The results demonstrate that DTE consistently outperforms classical and contemporary deep learning methods for both semi-supervised and unsupervised settings.

3. **Clarity and Organization:** The paper is well-structured, with a coherent flow from the introduction through to the experiments and conclusions. The use of visuals (e.g., Figure 1) effectively highlights the trade-offs between inference time and performance, aiding in reader comprehension.

4. **Specific Contributions:** The authors succinctly summarize their contributions, providing clarity around the novel aspects of the research, including the derivation of the analytical form for the posterior distribution of diffusion time and its connection to anomaly scoring.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Interpretability:** While the authors acknowledge the interpretability of their method as an area for improvement, further exploration into the interpretability of DTE compared to DDPM is needed, especially for practitioners who depend on understanding model decisions in critical domains like healthcare and finance.

2. **Limitations of Current Approach:** The discussion of limitations could be expanded. For instance, the paper could include more metrics or qualitative examples that illustrate potential shortcomings of DTE in specific contexts or types of anomalies, particularly where anomalies may not be well-represented in the training set.

3. **Comparison to State-of-the-Art:** Although DTE exhibits competitive performance against several existing methods, a more direct comparison with state-of-the-art anomaly detection approaches beyond those included in ADBench would strengthen the case for its adoption. Specifically, the discussion could benefit from including more in-depth comparisons of DTE with more advanced methods not covered in the benchmark results.

**Citations and Related Work:**
The paper appropriately engages with related work in the field, providing a solid literature review that grounds the research in contemporary conversations around anomaly detection. However, it unintentionally overlooks recent advancements in the domain of contextual and collective anomaly detection techniques, which could provide additional context for the applicability of the proposed methods. Additionally, the paper references “Parsons et al. (2023)” without providing adequate context or relevance to the present work.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of anomaly detection, with an innovative approach that balances performance with computational efficiency. Its findings have practical implications for various domains involving large and complex datasets. While certain aspects could benefit from further exploration, the study is well-executed and provides meaningful insights into the usability of diffusion models for anomaly detection tasks. I recommend accepting it for presentation at ICLR 2024, with minor revisions to enhance its interpretability and comparative depth.
