**Review of "LEMON: Lossless Model Expansion"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel approach called LEMON (LosslEssMOdel ExpansioN) aimed at enabling the efficient scaling of pre-trained deep neural network models, particularly Transformers. The authors propose a lossless model expansion technique that utilizes weights from smaller, pre-trained models to initialize larger models. This approach promises to reduce training time and computational costs significantly while maintaining model performance. The paper details the algorithmic framework, empirical validation of results on Vision Transformers and BERT, and it presents an optimized learning rate scheduler specifically designed for expanded models.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Contribution**: The concept of lossless model expansion is timely and relevant given the escalating demands for efficiency in training large-scale deep learning models. The paper effectively bridges the gap between smaller pre-trained models and larger architectures without losing essential information, thereby appealing to researchers focused on optimizing model training procedures.
   
2. **Empirical Validation**: The authors provide comprehensive experiments that demonstrate the performance of LEMON against established baselines. The reported computational savings—up to 56.7% for Vision Transformers and 33.2% for BERT—are impressive and suggest that LEMON can substantially alleviate the resource demands associated with training large language models.

3. **Methodological Rigor**: The paper includes a detailed methodological framework, including definitions of lossless expansion, symmetry breaking, and the learning rate scheduler, making it reproducible. The clarity of structural diagrams enhances the understanding of how LEMON operates across different model architectures.

4. **Broad Compatibility**: The versatility of LEMON, which claims compatibility with various network structures, including different types of Transformers, broadens its applicability across different deep learning domains.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Scope of Experiments**: Although the paper provides convincing results on Vision Transformers and BERT, it would be more compelling to see tests across a wider range of architectures, including CNNs beyond the brief mention of ResNet. This would further validate the claims of versatility.
   
2. **No Evaluation on Real-world Tasks**: The evaluation focuses predominantly on standard datasets and benchmarks. While this is significant, analyses on real-world application scenarios could provide further insights into the practical implications of using LEMON.

3. **Learning Rate Scheduler Insights**: The paper mentions an optimized learning rate scheduler but does not delve deeply into its specifics or how it compares against existing learning rate schedules widely used in practice. Further exploration of why the proposed adjustments yield better performance would strengthen the findings.

4. **Clarity in Mathematical Derivations**: While the mathematical sections provide a solid basis, some derivations could benefit from clearer explanations, especially for readers less familiar with advanced neural network concepts. 

**Additional Comments:**
The writing is generally clear, but certain sections—specifically those involving technical definitions—could be rephrased for broader accessibility. A prior work like "Martinez et al. (2021)" is referenced; however, it's unclear what specific methodologies or findings are being linked here, which might confuse readers trying to assess the continuity of research.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, the paper presents LEMON as a valuable contribution to the field of deep learning, particularly in the context of neural network scaling. Its novel approach to model expansion, coupled with empirical validation and detailed methodology, positions it as a noteworthy advancement in reducing computational intensity while preserving performance. Addressing the aforementioned weaknesses would bolster its impact and applicability in both academic and practical scenarios.
