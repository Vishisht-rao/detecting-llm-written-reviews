**Review of the Paper: "SaProt: Protein Language Modeling with Structure-Aware Vocabulary"**

**Summary:**
The authors present a new protein language model (PLM), SaProt, which incorporates a novel structure-aware vocabulary that integrates residue information with structural tokens derived from the 3D geometry of proteins. The motivation for this research is clearâ€”traditional PLMs primarily focus on residue sequences and often neglect crucial structural information. By addressing this issue, the authors claim that SaProt significantly enhances the accuracy and applicability of PLMs across various biological tasks.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach:** The introduction of a structure-aware vocabulary is a compelling advancement in the field of protein language modeling. The ability to combine primary (residue) and tertiary (structural) information in a seamless manner is an important step toward more comprehensive models.

2. **Extensive Evaluation:** The authors conduct thorough evaluations across 10 different downstream tasks, yielding consistent improvements over established models. This broad scope of testing enhances the robustness of their findings.

3. **Open Access Resources:** The provision of code, pre-trained models, and datasets for the community is commendable. This transparency can foster further research and development in the field.

4. **Comparative Performance:** SaProt not only outperforms traditional sequence-based models but also exhibits higher performance than several structure-based models. This highlights the efficacy of integrating structure as a key component in PLM training.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Dependence on Accuracy of Structural Predictions:** The performance of SaProt relies heavily on the accuracy of the structural tokens generated by tools like Foldseek. Errors in structural predictions could potentially propagate through to SaProt's predictions. The authors acknowledge this, but further exploration into mitigating this risk would strengthen the paper.

2. **Computational Cost:** The training of SaProt involved significant computational resources, using a large number of GPUs over an extended period. While this demonstrates the capability to handle large datasets, it may limit accessibility for researchers with fewer resources.

3. **Complexity of Vocabulary Creation:** The process of creating the structure-aware vocabulary could be complex and may require careful calibration, which could act as a barrier for researchers attempting to replicate the work or build upon it.

4. **Limited Generalizability of Findings:** Though the results are impressive, focusing on specific tasks may limit the generalizability of SaProt. It would be beneficial to test its performance on a broader range of biological applications.

**Additional Comments:**
The review could improve by providing a discussion on potential future directions, such as:
- Exploring further refinement of the vocabulary.
- Considering the integration with other biological data types (e.g., genomic, metabolomic data).
- Testing the model's ability to handle more diverse or less well-characterized protein sequences.

The paper refers to significant advancements in the field, citing various prior work, including studies on separate protein features, but there appears to be a reference to "Ramos et al. (2020)," which seems to lack relevance or specificity regarding its contribution to this advancement.

In conclusion, the paper makes a meaningful contribution to protein language modeling through its innovative integration of structural information. While SaProt displays commendable performance on various tasks, there are several areas where the authors could deepen their analysis and address potential limitations. Overall, it's a worthwhile read for those in the field of computational biology and protein modeling. 

**Recommendation:** I recommend acceptance of this paper with minor revisions to address the concerns raised and enhance clarity regarding the dependencies on structural predictions.
