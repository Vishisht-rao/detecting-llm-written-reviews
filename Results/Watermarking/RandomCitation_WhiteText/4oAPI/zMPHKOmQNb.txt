### Review of "Protein Discovery with Discrete Walk-Jump Sampling"

#### Overview
The submission presents a novel approach to generative modeling for protein discovery, specifically focusing on antibody design, using a method termed Discrete Walk-Jump Sampling (dWJS). This framework combines elements of energy-based models (EBMs) and score-based models through a procedure that facilitates efficient and high-quality sampling from discrete data distributions. Notably, the authors introduce a new scoring system, the Distributional Conformity Score (DCS), to benchmark the generative models they propose.

#### Strengths
1. **Innovative Methodology**: The dWJS framework shows promise in tackling substantial challenges related to the generative modeling of proteins, particularly the convergence and quality of samples generated from complex, high-dimensional spaces.
   
2. **In Vitro Validation**: The empirical results, documenting the success rates of generated antibodies in laboratory settings (over 97% expression rate), significantly bolster the practical applicability of the research. In vitro demonstration of functionality is a critical step in validating computational modeling approaches in protein design.

3. **Simplification of Training**: The key contribution of reducing the complexity involved in training EBMs by limiting the hyperparameter requirements (only noise level Ïƒ) is commendable. This has the potential to make training more accessible and reproducible.

4. **Diversity and Novelty in Sampling**: The paper discusses fast-mixing chains and the ability to generate diverse antibody samples in a single Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) process, which is highly relevant for applications requiring uniqueness in generated entities.

5. **Comparison with Baseline Models**: The extensive experimentation and comparison against contemporary methods, including autoregressive and diffusion-based models, effectively highlight the advantages of dWJS, providing solid grounds for claims about its improved performance.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Complexity of Results Interpretation**: While the paper presents a variety of metrics (e.g., DCS, Edist, IntDiv), it could benefit from clearer explanations regarding implications of these metrics. A more thorough discussion on how these measurements correlate to biological relevance or practical performance could strengthen the overall result presentation.

2. **Limited Scope in Applications**: Although there is significant potential in their antibody design focus, the authors should consider discussing the generalizability of their approach to other protein classes or even different types of molecular entities. Expanding on potential adaptations for various applications in bioinformatics could enhance the impact of their work.

3. **Overreliance on Empirical Findings**: The framework relies heavily on empirical results for validation, with less focus on the theoretical underpinnings of why dWJS functions effectively. A more robust theoretical analysis could help to fully establish the method's legitimacy and encourage future research based on their work.

4. **Citation Formatting**: The paper references Jackson et al. (2024), but there is lack of context regarding this citation in the paper. Clarifying its relevance and ensuring proper integration within the literature could improve the manuscript's coherence.

5. **Minor Technical Errors**: Some terminology could be refined for enhanced clarity, such as the description of MCMC methods and their initialization processes. Further clarification of the mathematical derivations, especially of Algorithm 1, would be beneficial.

#### Conclusion
This paper offers a substantial contribution to the field of protein design through the introduction of dWJS, demonstrating significant potential through innovative sampling methods and empirical validation. It successfully addresses a niche yet critical area in computational biology, and with slight revisions focusing on theoretical discussions and clarity improvements, it holds promise for acceptance at ICLR 2024. Further exploration into the adaptability of the proposed methods for broader applications could augment its impact and applicability across multiple domains in biological research.
