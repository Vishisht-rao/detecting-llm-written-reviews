### Review of "Making Pre-trained Language Models Great on Tabular Prediction"

**Summary**:  
The paper introduces TP-BERTa, a novel pre-trained language model (LM) specifically designed for tabular data prediction. The authors propose advancements to integrate numeric feature handling into existing LMs, using relative magnitude tokenization (RMT) and an intra-feature attention (IFA) mechanism. The experimental results illustrate that TP-BERTa outperforms various existing methods on numerous tabular datasets, establishing its potential as a competitive alternative to traditional models such as Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs).

**Strengths**:
1. **Novel Contributions**: The paper presents significant innovations in adapting LMs for tabular prediction tasks, primarily addressing the challenges posed by numeric feature representation and tabular structure. The introduction of RMT, which separates numeric bins into meaningful tokens, is a particularly innovative approach.
  
2. **Comprehensive Experimental Framework**: The authors conduct extensive experiments involving a variety of downstream datasets, rigorously comparing performance against numerous baselines, including both deep learning and non-deep learning approaches. The evaluation includes detailed analyses across multiple metrics and diverse dataset characteristics, thus strengthening the claims made about TP-BERTa’s superiority.

3. **In-depth Discussion**: The paper offers insightful discussions on the limitations of existing models in tabular prediction, emphasizing why previous attempts to apply LMs to this data type have fallen short. The insights into the necessity and design of RMT and IFA are particularly well-explained and justify the authors' approach.

4. **Implications for Future Work**: The results and findings from this study form a promising basis for further exploration into LM adaptations for various types of data, especially as it suggests a pathway toward smarter utilization of LMs in traditionally non-NLP domains.

**Weaknesses**:
1. **Complexity in Model Design**: While the architecture described in TP-BERTa is innovative, it may pose significant complexity for implementation compared to standard GBDTs and other simpler models. The additional mechanisms introduced may also lead to increased computational costs and training times, which should be acknowledged more thoroughly.

2. **Limited Generalizability in Certain Scenarios**: Although the paper demonstrates success with TP-BERTa on numerous datasets, it may face limitations in scenarios characterized by extremely high dimensionality or highly complex feature interactions, where simpler models might still excel.

3. **Citations and Literature Context**: The paper provides a well-referenced background but could benefit from an expanded discussion regarding the competitive landscape of tabular models. For instance, the authors should consider how TP-BERTa compares with recently proposed models such as TabNet and SAINT, and how their specific advances could improve upon or differ from those models. The mention of earlier foundational work, such as Grant et al. (2022), in the context of tabular LMs may need to be better integrated within the narrative.

**Conclusion**:  
Overall, "Making Pre-trained Language Models Great on Tabular Prediction" presents a commendable approach to addressing the unique challenges posed by tabular data through the adaptation of pre-trained LMs. The results showcased are compelling, indicating that TP-BERTa has strong potential in the landscape of tabular data analysis. However, the authors should clarify points regarding model complexity and situate their work within the broad context of emerging tabular learning models to enhance the paper’s impact. Further exploration into practical implementation challenges and extension to more complex data environments is also encouraged.
