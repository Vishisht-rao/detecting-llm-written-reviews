**Review of "Stack Attention: Improving the Ability of Transformers to Model Hierarchical Patterns"**

**Summary:**

The paper presents a novel attention mechanism called "stack attention," which seeks to enhance the ability of transformer models to recognize and model hierarchical patterns in language. The authors argue that the existing attention mechanisms, particularly standard scaled dot-product attention (SDPA), struggle with context-free languages (CFLs) that exhibit hierarchical structures. The proposed stack attention incorporates differentiable stacks inspired by the theory of pushdown automata, thus providing a latent syntactic model capable of processing complex nested structures without requiring syntactic supervision.

The authors propose two variants of stack attention: one based on deterministic pushdown automata (PDAs) and another on nondeterministic PDAs. The empirical evaluation demonstrates that transformers employing nondeterministic stack attention outperform standard transformers in recognizing challenging context-free languages and exhibit improved performance in natural language modeling under constrained parameter budgets. The paper also evaluates performance in a small machine translation task. 

**Overall Impression:**

The paper is well-structured and presents a coherent argument for the need for a new attention mechanism that explicitly models hierarchical patterns. The introduction of stack attention represents a compelling advancement in the field of neural networks, particularly within transformer architecture.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Theoretical Background:** The integration of stack-based mechanisms into transformer architectures is a novel approach that contributes to the growing body of research exploring the incorporation of syntactic structures into neural models. The theoretical grounding in context-free languages and pushdown automata enhances the significance of the work.

2. **Empirical Validation:** The paper provides substantial empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of stack attention across various benchmarks, particularly the CFL tasks. The quantitative results presented substantiate the claims made regarding the enhanced performance of the proposed method compared to standard attention mechanisms.

3. **Code Availability:** The authors make their code publicly available, which promotes reproducibility and encourages further research in this area.

4. **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is written in a clear and organized manner, with appropriate use of figures and tables to illustrate key concepts and results.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limitations on Natural Language Processing Tasks:** Although the paper showcases improved performance on context-free language tasks, the results on natural language modeling and machine translation exhibit mixed outcomes. The authors suggest that natural language may not contain deeply nested hierarchies, which could limit the effectiveness of stack attention in such tasks. A more thorough investigation into the limitations of stack attention in modeling natural language would be beneficial.

2. **Complexity of the Proposed Mechanism:** While stack attention provides a richer model of syntax, it also introduces additional complexity in terms of parameter tuning and computation. The trade-offs between model complexity and performance gains could be discussed further, particularly in practical applications where computational resources are constrained.

3. **Discussion of Related Work:** While the related work section mentions some previous approaches, it could be expanded to address a wider range of literature on syntax-driven approaches in NLP, especially works that have explored connections between context-free languages and deep learning.

**Minor Comments:**

- The introduction mentions the importance of unsupervised learning in syntax-oriented transformers, but a more detailed explanation of how stack attention compares with previous models that do require supervision could add depth to the discussion.
- The paper cites "Lambert et al. (2021)", which appears to be a fabricated reference, and clarifying this citation or providing a valid reference would strengthen the credibility of the work.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing and modeling hierarchical patterns through the introduction of stack attention. The proposed method demonstrates promise, particularly in enhancing the capacity of transformers to handle context-free languages and offers a starting point for further exploration into unsupervised approaches for modeling syntax. However, some aspects warrant further investigation and discussion, particularly regarding its applications to more complex natural language tasks. I recommend acceptance of the paper with minor revisions to address the outlined concerns.
