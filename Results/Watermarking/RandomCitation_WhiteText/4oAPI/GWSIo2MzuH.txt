**Review of "RETHINKING INFORMATION-THEORETIC GENERALIZATION: LOSS ENTROPY INDUCED PAC BOUNDS"**

**Summary**: 
The paper presents new high-probability generalization bounds based on loss entropy for machine learning models, bridging the gap left by existing work primarily focused on average-case scenarios and stringent loss function assumptions. The authors introduce both data-independent and data-dependent bounds, significantly simplifying the computation of prior metrics while adapting them to diverse conditions, including long-tailed loss distributions. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets, the paper demonstrates strong correlations between the proposed bounds and actual generalization error, making a case for their applicability in modern deep learning contexts.

**Strengths**:
1. **Innovative Approach**: The introduction of loss entropies as a measurement tool for bounding generalization error in PAC learning is a significant contribution. By simplifying high-dimensional information metrics to one-dimensional variables, the paper enhances computational tractability and practical usability, particularly in high-dimensional machine learning contexts.

2. **Theoretical Developments**: The authors present a comprehensive set of theorems that improve upon existing bounds by incorporating loss entropies. Their results extend prior work, showcasing significant advancements in both data-independent and data-dependent frameworks.

3. **Numerical Validation**: The extensive empirical evaluations presented in the paper substantiate the theoretical claims. The use of both synthetic and real-world datasets strengthens the validity of the findings, demonstrating that their generalization bounds outperform previous state-of-the-art bounds, including those derived from mutual information.

4. **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is well-structured, with a clear introduction followed by logical divisions into theoretical contributions and experimental results. Additionally, the notation is consistent and generally clear, making it accessible for readers familiar with the topic.

**Weaknesses**:
1. **Computational Feasibility**: While the paper claims improvements in computational tractability, it does not fully address how these bounds will perform in scenarios involving very large datasets or extremely high-dimensional spaces. More details on the scalability of the proposed methods would be beneficial.

2. **Specificity of Results**: Some claims regarding the advantages of the new bounds over previous works could benefit from more quantification, particularly in specific learning scenarios (e.g., regression tasks or classes with varying cardinality). Comparative analysis in such varied conditions could provide additional context on the applicability of the developed methods.

3. **Assumptions on Loss Functions**: The paper currently relies on assumptions that may not hold universally across all types of loss functions. While the paper mentions adaptability to long-tailed distributions, a broader discussion on limitations regarding different types of loss functions would strengthen the argument for general applicability.

**Minor Issues**:
- The paper could deepen its discussion of related works to contextualize the presented contributions better. While it cites several significant studies, the interactions with various strands of generalization bounds could be further elaborated.
- There are multiple instances of typographical and formatting errors in equations and theorems throughout the text that require attention (e.g., missing symbols or inconsistent formatting).

**Conclusion**:
Overall, this paper represents a meaningful contribution to the field of machine learning, particularly in understanding generalization through information-theoretic approaches. The development of PAC bounds based on loss entropy is both innovative and timely, and the empirical results support the theoretical claims. 
Although there are areas for improvement, the findings could significantly impact how researchers and practitioners analyze generalization in complex learning scenarios. Future work could further enhance these contributions by addressing noted limitations and exploring the bounds' performance across a broader array of loss functions and settings. I recommend this paper for acceptance, as its strengths considerably outweigh its weaknesses.

**Recommendation**: Accept with minor revisions.
