**Review of "VIEWS CANBEDECEIVING :IMPROVED SSL THROUGH FEATURE SPACE AUGMENTATION"**

**Summary:**
This paper addresses a critical issue in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL): the impact of spurious correlations on the efficacy of learned visual representations. The authors present a new method, Late-layer Transformation-based View Generation (LATETVG), aimed at mitigating the influence of spurious features that may lead to suboptimal performance, especially on minority subgroups. The paper provides theoretical foundations coupled with empirical evidence supporting the proposed approach, comparing it with existing methods and demonstrating improved worst-group performance across several benchmarks.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty and Contribution:** The exploration of spurious correlations in the context of SSL is a significant contribution, as prior work has primarily focused on supervised learning settings. The introduction of LATETVG as a means to rectify spurious connectivity in representation spaces is a fresh concept that could influence future research.

2. **Theoretical Justification:** The paper is well-grounded in theory, offering a clear framework to understand how common augmentations in SSL can inadvertently lead to spurious feature reliance. This theoretical underpinning strengthens the validity of the proposed method.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The authors evaluate LATETVG on multiple widely used datasets with varying complexities, demonstrating statistical rigor in their experimental analysis. They also assess the method's impact on worst-group performance, providing a practical perspective on its effectiveness.

4. **Impact on Minorities:** The focus on improving performance for minority groups addresses a crucial aspect of fairness in machine learning, embodying a commitment to building more equitable models.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Literature Review:** While the paper mentions relevant prior works, a more thorough integration of existing literature could enhance its context. For example, citing works such as "Soto et al. (2021)" could provide insights into parallel efforts in feature representation challenges.

2. **Limitations Discussion:** The paper could benefit from a more explicit discussion of the limitations of the LATETVG approach. For instance, detailing scenarios where the method might underperform or fail to address spurious correlations could provide a more balanced view.

3. **Clarity and Organization:** Some sections, particularly the theoretical background, could be streamlined for clarity. The presentation of definitions and assumptions might be more accessible with clearer headings or visual aids.

4. **Comparison with State-of-the-Art:** Although the experimental results show improvements, a more extensive comparison with state-of-the-art methods beyond simple re-sampling techniques could provide a compelling case for LATETVG's effectiveness. 

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of self-supervised learning by addressing an often-overlooked aspect of representation learning â€” spurious correlations. The proposed LATETVG method is theoretically sound and empirically validated, showcasing its potential to enhance model robustness without requiring group or label information. Future work that expands on the limitations and further benchmarks against a broader array of methods would further refine and solidify the contributions of this research. I recommend the paper for acceptance with minor revisions.
