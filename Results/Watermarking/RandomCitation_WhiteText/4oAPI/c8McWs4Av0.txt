**Review of the Paper: "Solving Challenging Math Word Problems Using GPT-4 Code Interpreter with Code-Based Self-Verification"**

**Overall Impression:**
The submitted paper presents a compelling investigation into the capabilities of the GPT-4 Code Interpreter when applied to solving mathematical word problems, emphasizing an innovative self-verification technique called explicit code-based self-verification (CSV). The authors provide a nuanced analysis of how code execution impacts the reasoning and accuracy of problem-solving in large language models (LLMs), and the results indicate significant performance improvements over existing methods.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Contribution:**
   The introduction of the explicit code-based self-verification method is a notable contribution to the field. By allowing GPT-4 to engage in self-debugging through code execution, the authors offer a new approach to improve LLMs' abilities in mathematical reasoning, thus addressing a long-standing limitation in LLM performance.

2. **Empirical Results:**
   The empirical evaluations across multiple challenging datasets (MATH, GSM8K, MMLU-Math) demonstrate considerable improvements in accuracy with the proposed methods. The documentation of results, such as achieving an impressive zero-shot accuracy of 84.3% on the MATH dataset, underscores the effectiveness of the CSV method.

3. **Systematic Analysis:**
   The systematic analysis of Code Usage Frequency and its correlation with accuracy is well-executed. The authors provide clear visualizations and statistical evaluations that substantiate their claims. This focus on analyzing internal mechanisms of LLMs, particularly through code execution, is crucial for advancing understanding in this area.

4. **Clarity and Structure:**
   The paper is well-organized, clearly separating the introduction, related work, methodology, and results. The writing style is generally accessible, making complex concepts understandable for the audience.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Comparison with State-of-the-Art:**
   While the results are promising, the paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion of how the CSV method compares with other state-of-the-art approaches beyond those mentioned. For instance, additional comparisons to recent developments in self-consistency and verification-driven methods would enhance the contextualization of their improvements.

2. **Lack of Discussion on Limitations:**
   The authors should consider providing a more comprehensive discussion of potential limitations or weaknesses in their approach. For example, how does the self-verification process affect the computational efficiency, and what are the implications for larger scales of mathematical problems?

3. **Details on Specific Implementation:**
   Though the paper touches on the mechanisms of self-debugging and the coded mechanisms behind the workings of CSV, more concrete examples or detailed pseudocode for the implementations used could bolster clarity and reproducibility. This would also help clarify the role of confidence scores in the weighted voting strategy.

4. **Data Dependency:**
   The reliance on particular datasets for training and evaluation raises questions regarding the generalizability of results. Future work should explore the performance of the proposed methodologies on a wider variety of mathematical problems, possibly encompassing different domains or topics.

**Minor Comments:**

- The reference formatting appears inconsistent in portions of the manuscript. The authors should adhere to the citation style guidelines of ICLR for uniformity.
- The references to previous works could be elaborated, especially concerning how exactly CSV builds upon or diverges from earlier methodologies in the literature.

In conclusion, this paper makes significant strides in enhancing the mathematical problem-solving capabilities of large language models through innovative use of code-based self-verification. The empirical results demonstrate clear advancements, supported by a sound analytical framework. With a few adjustments in terms of depth and breadth of comparison, the paper could further strengthen its impact. I recommend acceptance into the conference, with revisions suggested concerning the mentioned weaknesses and minor comments.
