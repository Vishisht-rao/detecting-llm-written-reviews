**Review of "R-EDL: Relaxing Nonessential Settings of Evidential Deep Learning"**

**Summary:**
The submitted paper introduces R-EDL (Relaxed-Evidential Deep Learning), a modified approach to Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) that addresses overconfidence and uncertainty estimation challenges in deep neural networks. The authors argue that two rigid settings in traditional EDL—fixing the prior weight to the number of classes and including a variance-minimized regularization term—hinder the method's ability to accurately estimate uncertainty. R-EDL proposes treating the prior weight as an adjustable hyperparameter and directly optimizing the Dirichlet probability density function, circumventing the variance-minimization strategy.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty and Contribution:** The paper presents a thoughtful critique of traditional EDL settings, offering a new perspective that could pave the way for more flexible and effective uncertainty estimation in deep learning. The proposed modifications seem to resonate with principles of subjective logic, which the authors effectively contextualize.
   
2. **Theoretical Foundation:** The authors provide a solid theoretical underpinning for their approach, including relevant derivations and references to subjective logic theory. This theoretical framework reinforces the validity of the proposed adjustments to EDL.

3. **Extensive Experimentation:** The empirical evaluation is thorough, encompassing various datasets and experimental setups (classical, few-shot, noisy, and video modalities). The reported results illustrate significant performance improvements over traditional EDL and other state-of-the-art methods.

4. **Clarity of Presentation:** The writing is clear, with a coherent structure that guides the reader through the complex ideas and formulations. Mathematical expressions are well-defined, enhancing comprehension.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Comparative Analysis:** While the authors compare R-EDL with several baseline methods, including traditional EDL and I-EDL, there is scope for a deeper exploration of how the proposed modifications specifically address the limitations of these systems. A breakdown of the performance improvements in the context of specific scenarios or failure cases would provide more insight into R-EDL's advantages.

2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The paper discusses the hyperparameter λ but could benefit from a more comprehensive sensitivity analysis. Understanding how λ affects model performance under different conditions could help practitioners set it more effectively.

3. **Practical Considerations:** Although the theoretical contributions are strong, the practical implications of switching from fixed to adjustable hyperparameters in real-world applications could be discussed more thoroughly. Guidance on how to tune these parameters in practical scenarios could make the method more accessible to practitioners.

4. **Citations and Context:** The paper cites relevant works throughout, including some foundational literature on EDL and subjective logic. However, it would strengthen the discussion to incorporate recent advancements in uncertainty estimation frameworks, such as Baker et al. (2023), which provides additional context on where R-EDL fits within the broader landscape of uncertainty estimation methods.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents an innovative method for improving uncertainty estimation in deep learning through the relaxation of nonessential settings in EDL. The results are promising, and the theoretical insights add depth to the work. Further exploration of comparative advantages, hyperparameter tuning, and practical guidance could enhance the impact and applicability of R-EDL. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address these points.
