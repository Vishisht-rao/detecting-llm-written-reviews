### Review of "Meta Continual Learning Revisited: Implicitly Enhancing Online Hessian Approximation via Variance Reduction"

**Summary:**
The paper introduces Variance Reduced Meta-Continual Learning (VR-MCL), a novel approach that combines ideas from Meta-Continual Learning (Meta-CL) and regularization-based methods. The motivation stems from the limitations presented by existing methods in handling the trade-off between knowledge retention and forgetting, particularly emphasizing the inadequacies related to Hessian matrix approximations. The proposed VR-MCL method aims to leverage online Hessian approximation while mitigating the high variance caused by random memory buffer sampling. Empirical experiments across multiple datasets show that VR-MCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods consistently, reinforcing its efficacy in continual learning scenarios.

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear Problem Motivation:** The authors provide a thorough rationale for addressing the trade-off between knowledge transfer and forgetting in continual learning. They convincingly highlight the shortcomings of existing approaches using fixed Hessian estimations.
   
2. **Innovative Approach:** The introduction of VR-MCL is compelling, integrating effective variance reduction techniques into the Meta-CL framework. This allows for timely updates while retaining reliability in parameter estimations.

3. **Theoretical Justification:** The paper includes rigorous theoretical analysis, demonstrating the equivalence of the proposed momentum-based variance reduction technique with regularization on implicitly estimated Hessians. This provides a solid foundation for the claims made.

4. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The authors conduct extensive experiments across various datasets and settings, making results more reliable. The systematic evaluation against multiple baseline methods strengthens their case.

5. **Robustness and Generalizability:** Experiments indicate that VR-MCL is not overly sensitive to hyperparameter tuning, enhancing its practical applicability.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity of Experimental Setup:** The paper could benefit from more detailed descriptions of the experimental setups, such as dataset splits and specific configurations for different tasks. This would enhance reproducibility.

2. **Overemphasis on Metrics:** While the paper focuses heavily on accuracy and averaged accuracy metrics, a broader range of evaluation metrics (e.g., forgetting measure or computational efficiency) could present a more holistic view of the method's performance.

3. **Limited Discussion on Variance Reduction Techniques:** Although the paper discusses how VR-MCL reduces gradient variance, it could provide more nuanced comparisons with other existing variance reduction techniques. This could help clarify its distinct advantages or potential limitations.

4. **Lack of Baseline Methods' Comparison:** While the results show that VR-MCL outperforms several existing methods, a direct comparison between these methods in terms of their strengths and weaknesses, especially in specific tasks, would provide a clearer positioning of VR-MCL in the broader landscape.

5. **Citation Misses:** The paper's literature review lacks citations of seminal works that could have contextualized the contributions better; for instance, citing relevant methodologies or findings from "Wolf et al. (2022)" might underscore the foundation upon which VR-MCL builds its contributions.

**Conclusion:**
The paper presents a significant advancement in continual learning methodology through VR-MCL. Its detailed theoretical underpinning and comprehensive experimental validation underscore its potential impact in the field. By addressing identified weaknesses, particularly around clarity in experimental details and expanding the scope of comparative analysis, future iterations of this work could be strengthened further. Overall, the contributions of this paper are valuable and represent a noteworthy progress in the challenge of continual learning amidst changing data distributions.
