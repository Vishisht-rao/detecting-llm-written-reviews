**Review of "Revisiting Non-Separable Binary Classification and Its Applications in Anomaly Detection"**

**Summary:**  
The authors of the paper present a new approach called "equality separation" to tackle the longstanding challenge of linearly classifying datasets that exhibit non-separability, exemplified by the XOR problem. They propose an innovative alteration to traditional binary classification techniques by adapting SVM objectives to focus on classifying data points as being either “on” or “off” some hyperplane rather than separating them into two halves. Additionally, they introduce the concept of "closing numbers" to quantify a classifier's ability to form closed decision regions, which they argue is beneficial for anomaly detection. The paper demonstrates the empirical effectiveness of equality separation in both theoretical formulations and practical supervised anomaly detection experiments across diverse datasets.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Paradigm:** The proposed equality separation paradigm presents an interesting and potentially valuable alteration to conventional approaches in binary classification. Seeking to classify based on proximity to a hyperplane rather than strict separability adds to the flexibility and expressivity of linear classifiers.
   
2. **Theoretical Contributions:** The introduction of closing numbers provides a fresh quantitative measure that connects classifier performance to their geometric properties, specifically in the context of anomaly detection. The theoretical justifications presented (e.g., the doubled VC dimension) lend credibility to the novel classifier.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The empirical validation across synthetic and real-world datasets, including cyber-attack data and medical anomalies, showcases the utility of the method. Achieving perfect AUPR scores in various settings reinforces confidence in the efficacy of equality separation.

4. **Integration with Neural Networks:** The authors’ approach to incorporate their classifier into neural network architectures through smooth approximations (specifically bump functions) demonstrates practical applicability. It indicates potential for broader implications in deep learning for anomaly detection.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity and Interpretation:** While equality separation offers a creative approach to binary classification, the complexities involved in understanding and implementing the new paradigm may pose challenges for practitioners. A clearer outline of practical considerations for deployment in real-world scenarios would enhance the accessibility of the methodology.

2. **Sensitivity to Initializations:** The authors mention sensitivity of equality separators to initialization and tuning hyperparameters (e.g., the σ value in the bump activation). Addressing this sensitivity through more robust initialization strategies or suggesting best practices could improve the reliability of the method.

3. **Limited Comparative Discussion:** While comparisons with halfspace separation and SVM approaches are established, additional context provided on why equality separation outperforms specific benchmarks (e.g., consideration of computational efficiency aside from AUPR) could strengthen the argument for adopting this new approach.

**Conclusion:**  
The paper presents a compelling and innovative approach to a well-known problem in machine learning. With its strong theoretical foundations and practical implications, the research significantly contributes to both classification and anomaly detection fields. Future work could focus on refining and simplifying the methodology for practitioners while ensuring robustness against initialization sensitivity. Overall, the paper is an important step forward in the understanding and application of classifiers in challenging contexts.
