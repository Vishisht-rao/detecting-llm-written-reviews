**Review of "LiDAR: Sensing Linear Probing Performance in Joint Embedding SSL Architectures"**

**Summary:**
The submitted paper introduces a novel metric called LiDAR (Linear Discriminant Analysis Rank) for evaluating the quality of representations learned through Joint Embedding (JE) architectures, particularly in self-supervised learning (SSL) contexts. The authors argue that existing metrics, such as RankMe, rely heavily on feature covariance ranks and fail to accurately predict the representation quality or optimal hyperparameter selection in a label-free setting. LiDAR aims to improve upon this by distinguishing informative features from uninformative ones using the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) framework.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Approach**: The introduction of LiDAR represents a meaningful advancement in the assessment of representations learned through JE architectures. By focusing on LDA-derived metrics, the method aligns more closely with the goals of SSL, particularly in situations where downstream tasks are impractical or resource-intensive to evaluate.

2. **Empirical Validation**: The authors present comprehensive experiments across multiple JE architectures, including variants of transformers and ResNets. The results suggest that LiDAR consistently outperforms RankMe in terms of correlation with downstream performance evaluated using linear probing, providing a robust endorsement of the proposed metric.

3. **Practical Implications**: The paper identifies the efficiency of LiDAR as a potentially transformative tool in the selection of hyperparameters for SSL architectures, which is of great significance to practitioners in the field.

4. **Well-Structured Presentation**: The organization of the paper is clear and logical, making it accessible to readers. The introduction adequately motivates the research, and the experimental results are presented with clarity and supporting statistical analyses.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity of Implementation**: While the paper discusses the computational efficiency of LiDAR, the actual implementation involving matrix inversion may pose challenges for practitioners working with high-dimensional data. A deeper exploration or suggestions for computational optimization could enhance the paper's applicability.

2. **Lack of Comparative Analysis with Other Metrics**: The paper could benefit from a more thorough comparative analysis with other alternative metrics in the literature beyond RankMe. For instance, presenting results against metrics tailored for specific tasks might offer broader insights into differential performance and situational applicability.

3. **Limited Domain Exploration**: While the authors validate their method on multiple known datasets like ImageNet, extending the evaluation to more diverse datasets, particularly in different domains, could strengthen the claims about the generalizability of the LiDAR metrics.

4. **Discussion on Limitations and Potential Failures**: The results indicate certain cases where LiDAR may perform suboptimally (e.g., in some high-dimensional embeddings). An exploration of potential failure cases or conditions leading to decreased performance would provide valuable context for users of the metric.

**Recommendations:**
- The authors should consider expanding on the theoretical foundations of LiDAR with respect to its metrics' stability and variance to better understand the implications of using LDA in various SSL settings.
- Future work may explore possibilities to handle situations where LiDAR contradicts expectations (e.g., showing negative correlations with probe accuracy in specific contexts) and offer strategies for mitigating such issues in practice.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of self-supervised learning by addressing a critical gap in the evaluation methodology of learned representations. The proposed LiDAR metric shows promise as a more robust and intuitive measure than existing metrics, thereby facilitating better model development and hyperparameter tuning. With minor revisions to increase accessibility and robustness, the work is well-positioned for positive reception within the research community.

**Score: 8/10 â€“ Recommended for acceptance with minor revisions.**
