### Review of "Statistically Optimal K-Means Clustering via Nonnegative Low-Rank Semidefinite Programming"

**Summary:**
The authors present a novel clustering algorithm that effectively combines the statistical robustness of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations with the computational efficiency typical of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). This approach addresses the well-known limitations of traditional K-means algorithms and proposes an NMF-like method rooted in a nonnegative low-rank restriction of the K-means optimization problem. The paper outlines a primal-dual gradient descent-ascent algorithm whose performance is demonstrated through experimental comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods.

**Strengths:**
1. **Theoretical Contribution**: The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm. Local linear convergence is established under various conditions, which significantly enhances the understanding of its optimization dynamics.
  
2. **Combination of Methods**: The integration of robust statistical results from SDP with scalable NMF techniques is a significant advancement in clustering methodologies. This hybrid approach is expected to provide better performance on large datasets that traditional SDP techniques struggle with due to computational limitations.

3. **Experimental Validation**: The experiments conducted on both synthetic datasets (GMM) and real-world datasets, including CIFAR-10 and UCI datasets, convincingly demonstrate that the proposed method achieves lower mis-clustering errors than various baseline algorithms.

4. **Clarity of Presentation**: The paper is well-structured, and the introduction clearly delineates the motivation for the research, situating it in the context of existing literature on K-means clustering and related relaxation techniques.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Missing Practical Insights**: While the theoretical framework is robust, the practical implications of the algorithm could be discussed in more detail. For instance, more insights into how hyperparameters are selected, and the impact of different distance metrics on clustering performance could benefit practitioners who wish to apply the method.

2. **Comparative Analysis Depth**: The comparative analysis, although effective, could be enhanced by incorporating more baselines, especially recent advancements in clustering that utilize deep learning frameworks, as suggested in Perez et al. (2024). This broader perspective would solidify the advantages of the proposed method over contemporary approaches.

3. **Limitations on Separation Assumptions**: The authors recognize that their convergence results hinge on certain separation assumptions, which might not hold in practice, particularly for noisy or overlapping clusters. Future work should explore these scenarios further and propose extensions or remedies to this limitation.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. **Expand Experimental Scope**: Including a greater variety of benchmarks in the experiments could help demonstrate the robustness and versatility of the proposed method under different clustering scenarios.

2. **Insight Into Hyperparameter Selection**: Providing guidelines or methods for hyperparameter optimization would be beneficial for their target audience, as they often face practical challenges during implementation.

3. **Broader Contextualization**: The inclusion of a more extensive discussion on the limitations of existing methods, and the potential for the proposed approach to address these issues, would enhance the contributions of the work.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper presents a compelling blend of theoretical insight and practical utility in the realm of clustering algorithms. By offering a statistically optimal K-means approach that mitigates the computational burdens of SDP while retaining its statistical power, the authors contribute meaningfully to the literature on unsupervised learning. With some refinements, the work could serve as a foundational basis for future research and applications in clustering methodologies. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
