### Review of the Paper: "REPLAN: Robotic Replanning with Perception and Language Models"

#### Summary
The paper presents a novel framework, REPLAN, that integrates large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) to facilitate effective robotic planning and replanning in dynamic environments. The authors argue that while recent advancements in LLMs have shown promise in generating planning actions for robots, they may fall short due to unforeseen obstacles and imperfect plans. The REPLAN framework seeks to address these issues by leveraging VLMs for real-time perception and grounding of high-level plans, enabling the robot to adapt its actions according to the state of the environment. The authors conducted extensive experiments across various tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of their approach, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline methods.

#### Strengths
1. **Innovative Integration of VLMs and LLMs**: The paper successfully demonstrates a new way to integrate high-level reasoning by LLMs with perceptual feedback from VLMs, addressing a significant challenge in robotic planning. This combination enhances the autonomy of robotic systems while minimizing human intervention.

2. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The authors conducted rigorous experiments in diverse environments, assessing REPLAN's performance in real-time replanning scenarios. Results showed that REPLAN significantly outperformed baseline models, clearly illustrating the advantages of the proposed approach.

3. **Hierarchical Planning Framework**: The introduction of a hierarchical planning architecture, with separate high-level and low-level planners, offers a structured and scalable method for handling complex long-horizon tasks. The use of a verifier to ensure the correctness of actions adds robustness to the approach.

4. **Theoretical and Empirical Contributions**: The paper not only provides a solid theoretical background but also extensively validates the proposed approach with empirical results, enhancing its credibility.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Dependence on VLMs' Accuracy**: The frameworkâ€™s reliance on VLMs for accurate perception and grounding poses a potential limitation. If the VLM inaccurately identifies objects or fails to provide correct feedback about the environment, the entire planning process may be compromised. This dependency needs to be addressed more explicitly in the discussion.

2. **Limited Generalizability**: While the experiments were thorough, it is unclear how well REPLAN would generalize to completely novel environments or unstructured scenarios not already tested. More emphasis could have been placed on cross-environment robustness and adaptability.

3. **Error Analysis**: Although the paper discusses various error cases in the experiments, the analysis could be more comprehensive. Identifying common patterns in failure cases and explaining how these could be mitigated in future work would be valuable.

4. **Citation of Future Works**: The paper cites "Hurley et al. (2024)" without providing further details. Since this is a future publication, the authors should clarify the relevance of this citation to their work or remove it to maintain transparency.

#### Suggestions for Improvement
- Include additional information on how REPLAN might address the limitations of VLMs. For instance, could it incorporate mechanisms to detect and correct potential misperceptions from VLMs?
  
- Elaborate on how the framework could be adapted or scaled for use in more complex, unstructured, or real-world environments, including the consideration of large object sets or dynamic changes.

- Strengthen the discussion around error handling and common pitfalls observed during experiments to guide future researchers in improving robustness.

#### Conclusion
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of robotic planning by improving the integration of language models and perception systems. The approach has practical implications for enhancing robot autonomy and performance in real-world tasks. Addressing the noted weaknesses and incorporating suggestions for improvement could further strengthen the paper's impact and applicability. The submission is well-written and presents a clear rationale supported by empirical evidence, making it a valuable addition to the current literature on robotic planning and artificial intelligence.

#### Recommendation
I recommend acceptance of the paper, with minor revisions to address the weaknesses outlined.
