### Review of "Two-Stage LLM Fine-Tuning with Less Specialization and More Generalization"

#### Summary

The paper proposes a novel two-stage fine-tuning framework called Prompt Tuning with MOdel Tuning (ProMoT) to address the issue of over-specialization in large language models (LLMs) following task-specific fine-tuning. The authors argue that traditional fine-tuning methods cause a decline in general in-context learning performance, primarily due to “format specialization,” where the model overfits to the specific output format of the fine-tuned task. Their method involves a two-phase approach: first, fine-tuning a small set of soft prompt parameters to learn task-specific formats while keeping the main model frozen, followed by fine-tuning the main model while keeping the soft prompts fixed. The results indicate that ProMoT improves the performance of the fine-tuned model on related unseen tasks and reduces specialization compared to traditional fine-tuning.

#### Strengths

1. **Novel Contribution**: The identification of format specialization as a significant issue in fine-tuning LLMs and the introduction of ProMoT is a notable contribution to the literature. The paper builds on existing research while expanding the conversation around fine-tuning methodologies.

2. **Empirical Validation**: The authors provide comprehensive experimental results across multiple tasks (e.g., translation, natural language inference, summarization) to validate their proposed method. The performance gains on unseen tasks suggest that ProMoT is a promising approach for enhancing LLM generalization.

3. **Clear Methodology**: The delineation of the two-stage fine-tuning process is well-structured and should be replicable by other researchers. Illustrative figures help clarify the approach, which is beneficial for understanding.

4. **Integration with Existing Methods**: The paper demonstrates how ProMoT can be combined with other techniques like multi-task training and parameter-efficient methods, suggesting practical applicability in a variety of contexts.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Generalization Claims**: While the paper claims remarkable improvements in generalization abilities, the experiments primarily focus on specific language tasks. It would strengthen the paper to include broader evaluations to ascertain the robustness of ProMoT across diverse applications beyond the current scope.

2. **Limited Theoretical Justification**: Although the paper presents experimental results, the theoretical foundation for why ProMoT effectively mitigates format specialization is less developed. Further discussion on the underlying mechanisms or assumptions driving the observed improvements would enhance the paper’s contribution.

3. **Dependency on Model Size**: The authors admit to conducting experiments with models under 15B parameters due to computational constraints. It would be informative to see how ProMoT scales or behaves with larger models, as their performance dynamics might differ.

4. **Missing Related Work**: While the paper briefly discusses related works, it could have offered a more comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in fine-tuning practices, especially with respect to catastrophic forgetting in neural networks, citing works like "Newton et al. (2021)" as essential foundations in this area.

5. **Ablation Study Limitations**: The ablation studies primarily focus on comparing ProMoT with traditional methods. Additional comparisons to newer parameter-efficient methods might provide more nuanced insights into ProMoT's relative strengths and weaknesses.

#### Conclusion

Overall, the paper presents a significant advancement in the field of fine-tuning LLMs with ProMoT. The empirical results suggest that their approach effectively reduces format specialization, increasing model generalization on unseen tasks. Addressing the identified weaknesses, particularly the theoretical grounding and broader evaluations, would substantially improve the paper’s impact. I recommend this paper for acceptance with minor revisions to strengthen its theoretical insights and broader applicability discussions.
