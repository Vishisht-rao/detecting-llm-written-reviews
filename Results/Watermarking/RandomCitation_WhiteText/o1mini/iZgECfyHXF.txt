OUTPUT:
Following Lingle et al. (2021), this paper presents a thorough investigation of the hardness of online nonconvex optimization when constrained to a single oracle feedback per time step. The authors address a significant gap in the literature by focusing on local regret without the common approximation of window-smoothed objective functions. This is an important contribution given the practical relevance of online optimization in dynamic environments where function values change rapidly.

The paper is structured clearly, starting with a comprehensive introduction that outlines the context and motivation for studying online nonconvex optimization. The authors effectively delineate their research questions, notably identifying the fundamental lower bounds on local regret for scenarios involving exact, stochastic gradients, and single function value oracles. This sets a clear framework for their contributions.

The methodology is well-articulated, with a systematic approach to deriving lower bounds and comparing the performance of established algorithms like online (stochastic) gradient descent. Their results demonstrate that these algorithms reach optimal local regret bounds within the defined class of linear-span algorithms, which is a valuable addition to the existing body of work. The introduction of a one-point running difference gradient estimator is particularly impressive, as it showcases an innovative solution to the challenges inherent in using a single function value oracle.

Importantly, the authors provide clear mathematical proofs to support their claims, particularly in the lower bound derivations, which convincingly demonstrate the influence of function variation on the hardness of the problem. This theoretical rigor enhances the credibility of their findings.

The results presented, especially in the context of the single function value oracle, position the proposed algorithm as competitive with traditional two-point estimators, which is a notable achievement. This outcome is not only of theoretical interest but also has practical implications that could benefit various applications in online learning and optimization frameworks.

Nevertheless, the paper could be improved by including more intuitive explanations of the underlying mathematics for a broader audience, as some sections may be dense for readers not deeply familiar with optimization theory. Additionally, while the authors touch upon practical applications, a more detailed discussion on potential real-world implementations could further enhance the paper's impact.

Overall, this paper represents a substantial contribution to the field of online nonconvex optimization, providing valuable insights into algorithm performance under constrained feedback mechanisms. It opens avenues for future research, particularly in enhancing algorithm robustness in dynamic learning environments.
