OUTPUT:
Following Edens et al. (2017), this paper presents a compelling and innovative approach to address the issue of robust overfitting in deep neural networks during adversarial training (AT). The authors introduce a novel learning paradigm called "Forget to Mitigate Overfitting" (FOMO), which draws on the concept of active forgetting and relearning processes observed in human cognition. This paradigm successfully integrates a forgetting phase, which involves randomly forgetting a subset of weights, and a relearning phase designed to refine the model’s ability to generalize without succumbing to overfitting.

### Strengths

1. **Novelty and Contribution**: The concept of actively forgetting weights in neural networks is a fresh perspective in the context of adversarial training. The paper effectively bridges the gap between cognitive neuroscience and machine learning, making a significant theoretical and practical contribution to the field.

2. **Experimental Results**: The experimental validation is robust, with extensive testing conducted on benchmark datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN. Results demonstrate that FOMO consistently outperforms several baseline methods across various metrics related to robust accuracy and generalization. This includes impressive improvements in last-epoch robust accuracy and robustness to AutoAttacks, which are critical for practical applications of deep learning systems.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The authors present a thorough evaluation of their approach, including comparisons against multiple state-of-the-art techniques and an ablation study identifying the contributions of individual components such as the forgetting, consolidation, and regularization steps.

4. **Practical Insights**: The paper discusses computational efficiency, indicating that FOMO incurs relatively low additional computational costs compared to baseline methods, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.

### Weaknesses

1. **Theoretical Foundations**: While the paper draws inspiration from cognitive science, a more in-depth theoretical framework justifying why the proposed forgetting mechanism leads to improved generalization in neural networks could enhance its rigor. Addressing this could strengthen the paper’s foundational claims and broaden its impact on both fields.

2. **Parameter Sensitivity**: The paper discusses varying percentages of forgotten parameters and their impact on performance; however, further investigation into the sensitivity of FOMO to different sparsity rates, learning rates, and decay parameters would provide crucial insights for practitioners looking to apply the method in diverse contexts.

3. **Generalization to More Complex Systems**: While the results on benchmark datasets are compelling, additional explorations on more complex architectures or real-world datasets would further validate the approach and demonstrate its versatility.

4. **Long-term Stability**: The paper could benefit from investigating the long-term stability of the learned models post-training to gauge their performance over time under novel adversarial scenarios or distribution shifts.

### Conclusion

Overall, this paper presents a significant advancement in the adversarial training landscape, highlighting the importance of active forgetting in enhancing model generalization and robustness. The innovative approach, backed by strong empirical results, suggests that FOMO could serve as a valuable tool for devising more resilient deep learning systems against adversarial threats. The authors should consider incorporating the suggestions mentioned to further enhance the theoretical grounding and applicability of their contributions.
