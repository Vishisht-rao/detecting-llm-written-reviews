OUTPUT:
Following Kunkel et al. (2015), this paper presents a compelling contribution to the field of score matching methods in deep learning by leveraging Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQ) to enhance the memory efficiency and computational feasibility of score matching. The authors effectively address critical challenges associated with applying score matching in the context of deep neural networks (DNNs), which are particularly plagued by high computational and memory costs due to the need for derivatives and Hessians of the log density function.

### Strengths:

1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The integration of DEQ into score matching is an innovative approach that addresses a significant limitation in the field. The authors present a thorough theoretical analysis, grounding their approach in established mathematical frameworks such as the implicit function theorem. This foundational rigor is commendable and provides a clear justification for their methodological choices.

2. **Comprehensive Empirical Evaluation**: The empirical studies are extensive and validate the proposed DEQ-assisted score matching models across various tasks, including density estimation and generative modeling. The comparative performance metrics (e.g., FID scores, memory usage) convincingly demonstrate that the proposed method not only retains competitive effectiveness but also significantly reduces memory overhead compared to existing architectures.

3. **Systematic Organization**: The paper is well-structured, with clear sections that guide the reader through background theory, the proposed methods, and experimental validation. The detailed explanation of the DEQ framework and its application in the context of score matching allows readers, regardless of their prior familiarity with the concepts, to grasp the main contributions effectively.

4. **Addressing Computational Challenges**: The focus on alleviating memory constraints associated with score matching in DNNs is particularly noteworthy. The paper provides practical solutions, including the implementation of phantom gradients and efficient backpropagation methods, which would be of interest to practitioners facing similar computational limitations.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Complexity of Implementation**: While the theory is elegantly presented, certain aspects of the implementation may pose challenges to practitioners. Although the authors provide pseudocode and reference implementations, a more beginner-friendly explanation of the DEQ framework and its integration into existing models could enhance accessibility for a broader audience.

2. **Limitations and Future Work**: While the authors touch on the necessity of inverting Jacobian matrices and the associated computational costs, a more thorough discussion of the limitations of the proposed method and potential avenues for future research would strengthen the paper. For instance, exploring alternative methods for approximating the inverse Jacobian could be beneficial.

3. **Empirical Comparisons**: Despite showing improvements over various baselines, further empirical comparisons with additional state-of-the-art methods would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's performance. Consider including a wider range of architectures or specific conditions where DEQ might struggle compared to alternative approaches.

### Conclusion:

Overall, the paper presents a significant advancement in the application of score matching methods through the integration of DEQ, effectively addressing critical issues related to memory efficiency and computational cost in deep learning. While there are areas for improvement, particularly around accessibility and broader empirical validation, the contributions made herein represent an essential step forward in the field. This work will likely inspire further research and exploration of efficient training methodologies for complex models, fostering advancements in machine learning practices.
