OUTPUT:
Following Calderone et al. (2018), this paper presents a novel approach to counterfactual density estimation using kernel Stein discrepancies in a doubly robust framework. The work addresses a significant gap in the existing literature by offering a method to model counterfactual distributions that only require knowledge of parametric families of densities up to normalizing constants. This is particularly relevant in causal inference, where traditional methods often rely solely on mean estimation, which can overlook essential distributional aspects.

### Strengths:

1. **Innovative Approach**: The use of kernel Stein discrepancies to estimate counterfactual distributions is a fresh contribution to the field. This approach allows for greater flexibility and efficiency in modeling, especially when dealing with families of distributions where normalizing constants are unknown.

2. **Doubly Robustness**: The paper successfully integrates the concept of double robustness into the proposed estimator, which is a noteworthy advancement. This feature ensures that the model remains consistent as long as either of the nuisance estimators (propensity score or outcome regression) are correctly specified.

3. **Theoretical Framework**: The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis, offering sufficient conditions for the consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator. This rigorous approach adds credibility to their results and would be of great interest to theoreticians.

4. **Empirical Validation**: The paper includes a variety of empirical experiments demonstrating the performance of the proposed estimator across different scenarios, including with real-world data. This practical validation complements the theoretical findings, making the contributions more robust.

5. **Clarity of Presentation**: The manuscript is well-organized, with a clear structure that guides the reader through the introduction, methodology, related work, theoretical analysis, and experimental results.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Lack of Benchmark Comparisons**: While the authors note the absence of natural benchmarks due to the novelty of their approach, some comparison to existing methodologies would strengthen the discussion on the advantages of the proposed estimator. Future work might benefit from experimenting with synthetic or controlled datasets that allow for clearer performance comparison with state-of-the-art methods.

2. **Complexity Considerations**: The proposed algorithm has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) for evaluating certain statistics, which may be prohibitive for large datasets. Although the authors mention that the nuisance estimators only need to be fitted once, a deeper exploration of the computational efficiency and scalability of the method would enhance its applicability, particularly in practical settings.

3. **Assumptions on Data**: While the assumption framework is solid, the paper could further benefit from a discussion on the robustness of the theoretical results when faced with common violations in real-world data, such as unmeasured confounding or misspecification of the functional form of the propensity scores or outcome models.

### Conclusion:

Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of causal inference and density estimation. The results are promising and offer potential for future research directions, such as extending the framework to time-varying treatments or off-policy evaluation contexts. The combination of rigorous theoretical development and practical empirical results indicates that the proposed methodology could become a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners dealing with counterfactual analysis and related domains. I recommend this paper for acceptance, with suggestions for minor revisions addressing the aforementioned points.
