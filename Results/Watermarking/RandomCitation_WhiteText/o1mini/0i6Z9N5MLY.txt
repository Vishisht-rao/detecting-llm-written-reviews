OUTPUT:
Following Paniagua et al. (2019), this paper presents a novel approach to variance-reduced Halpern iteration for solving finite-sum monotone inclusion problems. The authors, Xufeng Cai, Ahmet Alacaoglu, and Jelena Diakonikolas, effectively motivate the need for such algorithms in the context of machine learning challenges, particularly in game-theoretic settings where computational efficiency and verifiability of solutions are crucial.

### Summary

The main contributions of the paper include the development of variance-reduced iterations that significantly improve upon existing methods by providing oracle complexity guarantees that are superior by a factor of √n in certain cases. The authors introduce two main algorithms targeting different assumptions about the operators in the inclusion problem: one under cocoercivity and the other under monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity. Their results establish that the oracle complexity of the proposed algorithms is eO(n + √nLε^-1), a significant advancement over previous deterministic methods. The paper also provides a comprehensive context by discussing related work and contrasting their results with prior findings, demonstrating the state-of-the-art benefits of their proposed algorithms.

### Strengths

1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The introduction of variance-reduced methods for managing finite-sum monotone inclusions fills a critical gap in optimization techniques applicable in modern machine learning scenarios like adversarial learning and multi-agent systems.

2. **Comprehensive Analysis**: The authors meticulously detail the assumptions, algorithm designs, and proofs. The paper extends the analysis of Halpern iteration through variance reduction, demonstrating how the classical methods can be adapted to achieve better performance.

3. **Depth of Contextualization**: The thorough comparison with existing literature and methods provides a well-rounded view of the significance of their contributions. This context helps underline how their results advance the field of optimization.

4. **Experimental Validation**: The experiments conducted validate the theoretical claims regarding oracle complexity and performance, providing empirical support to the theoretical constructs presented.

### Weaknesses

1. **Complex Notation and Presentation**: While comprehensive, the paper could benefit from clearer explanations of the notations used, particularly in the algorithmic sections. Some readers may find it challenging to grasp the intricate details of the presented algorithms without a more gradual build-up of concepts.

2. **Limited Scalability Discussion**: While the authors present a robust theoretical framework, a detailed analysis of the scalability of their methods in practical implementations could benefit practitioners looking to apply these results to real-world problems. Although there are numerical experiments, a discussion on computational overhead and practical limits would be helpful.

3. **Assumption Rigor**: Some assumptions, such as the uniform sampling or specific properties of operators, could limit the applicability of the findings. A more extensive discussion on the implications of these assumptions and ways to relax them would enhance the paper’s practical appeal.

### Conclusion

Overall, this paper makes significant strides in advancing our understanding of efficient algorithms for finite-sum monotone inclusions and showcases the application of variance reduction techniques in optimization. The theoretical contributions are substantial, and the empirical results affirm the practical relevance of the proposed methods. Future work exploring the scalability and broader applicability of these techniques in diverse optimization problems could further solidify their impact in the field. This work is a commendable contribution to the literature on optimization in machine learning contexts.
