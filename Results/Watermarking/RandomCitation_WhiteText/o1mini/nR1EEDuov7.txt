OUTPUT:
Following Tobar et al. (2023), this paper presents a novel approach to enhancing the detection and traceability of deep generative models by embedding a universal adversarial signature directly into the models. The authors identify the potential risks associated with the misuse of generative models, such as misinformation and identity theft, and argue that current methods for detecting synthesized images often struggle with generalization to unseen models. They propose a two-stage method: first, a signature injector generates imperceptible adversarial signatures for images through adversarial training, and second, these signatures are integrated into pre-trained generative models, allowing for unified detection capabilities across different models.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Contribution:** The approach of embedding adversarial signatures directly into model parameters is a promising advancement in the field of generative model security. This method aims to create a system that remains robust even when new generative models are released.

2. **Adversarial Learning Framework:** The use of adversarial training to discover and embed signatures is well-motivated and can potentially yield a fine balance between imperceptibility and detectability.

3. **Quantitative Validation:** The experiments on the FFHQ and ImageNet datasets contribute to the body of knowledge by presenting comparative results under rigorous conditions. The high detection accuracy demonstrated on various models and datasets is a significant achievement.

4. **Potential Implications for Society:** The authors thoughtfully discuss the societal implications of their work, which is critical given the rapid advancements in generative technologies. The integration of signatures addresses a pressing issue in the field of AI ethics.

5. **Comprehensive Related Work Review:** The discussion of related works provides good context for the problem space and highlights the novelty of the proposed solution.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity and Practical Implementation:** While the theoretical framework is strong, the practical aspects of implementing the signature injector and fine-tuning the generative models may pose challenges in real-world applications. It would be beneficial for the authors to include a discussion on the logistics of these processes beyond the experimental environment.

2. **Limited Scope of Experiments:** The experiments focus predominantly on two datasets and three models. While the results are promising, expanding the evaluation to more diverse datasets and model architectures could provide a clearer picture of the generalizability and robustness of the proposed method.

3. **Vulnerability to Retraining:** While the authors discuss the security of their adversarial signatures, they acknowledge potential vulnerabilities if malicious users attempt to retrain models on clean datasets. Providing insights into mitigating such risks or discussing the feasibility of these attacks in practice could strengthen their argument.

4. **Over-reliance on Adversarial Techniques:** The reliance on adversarial techniques to create signatures might also be exploited by the adversaries to counteract these methods. An exploration of how these signatures could be made less susceptible to attack or how the framework can adapt to adversarial countermeasures could enhance the contributions.

**Conclusion:**

In summary, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the ongoing discourse surrounding the security of deep generative models. The proposed framework for embedding universal adversarial signatures is both innovative and practical. However, further exploration of the challenges of practical implementation, enhanced testing on a broader range of models, and discussions around potential vulnerabilities are needed. With comprehensive revisions addressing these points, this work holds great potential for advancing the field.
