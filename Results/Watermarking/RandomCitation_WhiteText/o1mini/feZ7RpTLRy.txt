OUTPUT:
Following Sanjuan et al. (2017), this paper presents a thorough investigation into hyperbolic embeddings, emphasizing the need to bridge the gap between the machine learning and algorithmic communities. The authors make a significant contribution by highlighting and comparing various hyperbolic embedding techniques, particularly focusing on the BFKL embedder by Bläsius et al. (2016), Poincaré embeddings by Nickel and Kiela (2017), and Lorentz embeddings (Nickel and Kiela, 2018). 

**Strengths:**

1. **Relevance and Timeliness**: The paper addresses a critical gap in the literature concerning the lack of cross-referencing between the algorithmic and machine learning communities regarding hyperbolic embeddings. By comparing computational performance and embedding quality, it provides a timely discussion that could benefit both fields.

2. **Thorough Experiments**: The authors conduct extensive experiments across various real-world hierarchies and networks, as well as on simulated data. The use of multiple evaluation metrics—MeanRank and Mean Average Precision (mAP)—adds robustness to their findings. The observation that BFKL embeddings are significantly faster while often achieving similar or better quality compared to Lorentz embeddings is noteworthy.

3. **Comprehensive Analysis**: The authors provide a thorough analysis of the embedding techniques, explaining their theoretical underpinnings and properties of hyperbolic geometry. The detailed descriptions of the algorithms, along with numerical comparisons, enhance the clarity and depth of the discussion.

4. **Visualizations and Tables**: The inclusion of visual representations of the embeddings and comprehensive data tables improves the readability and accessibility of the results, allowing for straightforward comparison.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Reproducibility Issues**: The differences in results compared to Nickel & Kiela (2017; 2018) raise concerns about reproducibility. The authors acknowledge this but do not provide a substantial explanation for these discrepancies. A more detailed investigation into potential reasons for these differences, such as variations in datasets or implementation details, would enhance the paper's impact.

2. **Limited Discussion on Practical Applications**: While the theoretical and empirical contributions are compelling, the paper could benefit from a more pronounced discussion on the practical applications of these embeddings. Exploring the implications of using one embedding method over another in real-world applications would help contextualize the findings.

3. **Clarity and Structure**: Some sections of the paper are dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with hyperbolic geometry. Simplifying complex explanations and ensuring a consistent flow could improve comprehensibility.

**Conclusion**: 

Overall, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the understanding of hyperbolic embeddings by juxtaposing approaches from different communities, providing empirical evidence of performance differences, and suggesting improvements for future research. Addressing the weaknesses and enhancing clarity could solidify its impact on the field. I encourage the authors to consider these points for a more comprehensive final submission.
