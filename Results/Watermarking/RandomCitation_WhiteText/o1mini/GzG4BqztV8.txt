OUTPUT:
Following Blakemore et al. (2024), this paper presents a novel training approach for deep neural networks (DNNs) called High Entropy Propagation (EntProp) that aims to enhance both standard accuracy and robustness against out-of-distribution (OOD) domains. The central hypothesis is that transforming clean, high-entropy samples can generate more distinguishable out-of-distribution samples, thereby improving the learning process when combined with Auxiliary Batch Normalization layers (ABNs). 

### Strengths:
1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The paper tackles a significant challenge in deep learning — the failure to generalize to OOD samples. By focusing on the entropy of samples as a distinguishing metric, the proposed method provides a fresh perspective on training with mixed domains.

2. **Methodological Rigor**: The authors offer a clear methodology with well-defined components, including data augmentation and free adversarial training techniques. The organization of the paper, particularly the detailed explanation of EntProp and the associated training costs, makes it easy to follow.

3. **Experimental Validation**: The paper provides comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and CUB-200-2011 datasets, comparing EntProp against multiple baselines — notably demonstrating superior performance in terms of standard accuracy, robustness, and lower training costs. Additionally, the identification of the limitations of existing techniques highlights a mature understanding of the field.

4. **Adaptive Sampling**: The mechanism for selecting high-entropy samples for training the ABN-applied network is well-articulated and appears to provide a practical improvement over random sampling and some existing methods.

### Weaknesses:
1. **Limitations in Adversarial Robustness**: While the paper effectively investigates the balance between standard and robust performance, it acknowledges limitations in adversarial robustness. The authors could strengthen their claims by providing a clearer strategy for integrating adversarial training effectively within their framework.

2. **Potential Overfitting in Limited Datasets**: The authors mention that the method prevents overfitting on small datasets; however, empirical evidence regarding how well this holds under various conditions and datasets remains somewhat limited. Further elaboration or additional experiments could provide a stronger basis for these claims.

3. **Complexity**: The integration of multiple components into the training process, such as MixUp and free adversarial training, while beneficial, may increase the complexity of implementation. A discussion on practical considerations and potential computational overhead for practitioners could improve the accessibility of the proposed approach.

4. **Discussion on Metrics**: The analysis of alternative metrics for distinguishing sample domains is somewhat cursory. A deeper exploration of why entropy was chosen over other metrics and how they compare in different contexts could benefit the reader.

### Conclusion:
Overall, this paper delivers a promising approach to tackling the dual challenge of attaining high standard accuracy while enhancing robustness against OOD examples. The thorough experiments and rigorous methodological framework contribute significantly to the literature on disentangled learning methods. Future work addressing the concerns around adversarial robustness and the practical implementation of EntProp would further strengthen its impact in real-world applications. This paper is a worthy contribution to the ICLR conference and deserves careful consideration for acceptance.
