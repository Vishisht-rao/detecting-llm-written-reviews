OUTPUT:
Following Corn et al. (2023), this paper presents an interesting contribution to the field of adversarial attacks in machine learning by introducing a new approach called clipped normalized-gradient heavy-ball momentum (clipped NGM). The authors aim to address the limitations of existing methods, particularly those that rely on the sign operation for gradient updates, by employing a clipping technique that retains more information about the gradient magnitude and direction. The paper is well-structured, with a clear abstract, introduction, methodology, experimental analysis, and discussion of results.

### Strengths:

1. **Novelty and Technical Contribution**:
   - The proposed clipped NGM method is a novel approach that improves upon existing adversarial attack methods like MI-FGSM by integrating gradient clipping and retaining more gradient information. This contrasts with the typical sign operations that many state-of-the-art algorithms rely upon.

2. **Theoretical Analysis**:
   - The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation for the clipping techniqueâ€™s effectiveness by proving optimal averaging convergence for general constrained convex problems. This is a significant contribution that helps to bridge the gap between theory and practice, enhancing the understanding of how clipping can optimize convergence in adversarial contexts.

3. **Extensive Experiments**:
   - The empirical results are thorough and demonstrate the advantages of the clipped NGM over various existing methods across different datasets and model architectures. The inclusion of comparison metrics, attack success rates for both white-box and black-box scenarios, and a detailed experimental setup adds to the robustness of the results.

4. **Interpretability and Visualization**:
   - The paper includes visual examples of benign and adversarial images generated by different methods, which can help the audience better understand the practical implications of the algorithms discussed.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Clarity and Readability**:
   - While the paper is well-organized, there are instances where the exposition could be clearer. The terminology used, especially in the convergence proofs and algorithm descriptions, may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with advanced optimization techniques. Some sections are notably dense and would benefit from more intuitive explanations or illustrative examples.

2. **Broader Context**:
   - The introduction could benefit from a more extensive discussion on the significance of this research in the larger context of adversarial robustness in machine learning. More background on existing solutions and why they fall short would help ground the proposed method more firmly within the existing literature.

3. **Limited Scope of Experiments**:
   - The experiments, while comprehensive, primarily focus on specific datasets (e.g., ILSVRC 2012) and models. It would enhance the impact of the paper if the authors explored the effectiveness of their method on a broader range of datasets or considered varying perturbation settings beyond those examined.

4. **Computational Efficiency**:
   - Although the clipping technique promises improved theoretical guarantees, the paper does not significantly address the computational cost associated with this approach. A discussion on the efficiency of the proposed method compared to traditional ones, especially in real-time applications, would be valuable.

### Conclusion:

Overall, this paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of adversarial attacks by introducing the clipped NGM method, which theoretically and empirically shows promise in addressing some of the limitations of existing techniques. While improvements could be made in clarity and scope, the rigor of the theoretical analysis and the robustness of the experimental findings are commendable. This work holds potential for future developments in the area of adversarial robustness and could pave the way for more sophisticated techniques that balance efficiency with performance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to enhance clarity and contextual understanding.
