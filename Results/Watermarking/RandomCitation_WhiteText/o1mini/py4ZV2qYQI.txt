OUTPUT:
Following Matthew et al. (2016), this paper presents a novel federated learning approach called HybridTree, specifically designed to address the challenges of training Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDTs) in a hybrid data setting. The authors identify the significant gap in existing literature where federated learning primarily investigates horizontal and vertical data configurations, leaving the more complex hybrid scenarios largely unaddressed.

### Summary of Contributions:
1. **Meta-Rules in Trees**: The authors observe the existence of consistent split rules (meta-rules) across different trees, which they utilize to develop a more efficient training mechanism.
2. **Layer-Level Training**: The proposed HybridTree method adopts a layer-level training strategy, allowing for effective integration of knowledge from multiple parties without requiring the aggregation of all statistics at every node. This approach significantly reduces the communication overhead, which is a critical bottleneck in federated learning.
3. **Experimental Validation**: Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that HybridTree achieves comparable accuracy to conventional centralized training while substantially reducing both computational and communication costs.

### Strengths:
- **Innovative Methodology**: The introduction of a layer-level training strategy represents a significant advancement in federated GBDT algorithms, overcoming limitations associated with node-level and tree-level aggregations. By effectively utilizing meta-rules, the authors enhance the applicability of GBDTs in hybrid settings.
- **Comprehensive Experiments**: The results presented in this study are rigorous, showcasing the advantages of the HybridTree approach through comparisons with various established baselines, emphasizing its efficiency and effectiveness.
- **Practical Relevance**: The study addresses real-world applications, such as fraud detection in banking systems, making the findings particularly relevant for practitioners in the field of machine learning and federated learning.

### Areas for Improvement:
- **Theoretical Guarantees**: While the paper provides insights into theoretical foundations and guarantees the effectiveness of layer-level training, a more detailed analysis regarding the theoretical implications of meta-rules could enhance the credibility of the proposed method. For instance, stronger theoretical guarantees regarding consistency and convergence in the presence of noise across participants could be valuable.
- **Scalability Analysis**: Although scalability is mentioned, additional analysis regarding the impacts of increasing the number of parties and data heterogeneity would benefit the overall evaluation. How does HybridTree behave under extreme conditions of data scarcity or when the number of parties significantly increases?
- **Broader Applicability**: The authors acknowledge that the method is primarily tuned for tabular data. Exploring the potential of HybridTree in contexts involving non-tabular data (e.g., images or text) would broaden the impact and applicability of their findings.

### Conclusion:
Overall, the paper is well-structured and presents meaningful contributions to the field of federated learning, particularly in hybrid data environments. The proposed HybridTree method is a step forward in making federated GBDTs more practical and efficient. With the suggested improvements, particularly regarding theoretical guarantees and broader applicability, this work has the potential to significantly advance the state of federated learning methodologies.
