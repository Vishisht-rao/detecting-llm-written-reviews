OUTPUT:
Following Gandy et al. (2020), this paper provides a comprehensive study on the privacy risks associated with Curriculum Learning (CL) in machine learning. The authors convincingly argue that while CL can enhance performance by leveraging a structured approach to training data, its implications for privacy, specifically through membership inference attacks (MIA) and attribute inference attacks (AIA), have not been extensively examined in prior work. 

### Strengths:

1. **Novel Contribution**: The paper fills an important gap in the literature by investigating how CL impacts model privacy. This is a significant contribution, given the rising concerns about privacy in machine learning, and the findings are timely and relevant.

2. **Robust Methodology**: The authors employ rigorous experimental designs across diverse datasets, utilizing multiple attack methods to probe the vulnerabilities introduced by CL. By evaluating the impact of different CL methods (bootstrapping, transfer learning, baseline, anti-curriculum), they provide a comprehensive analysis of how these methods differentially affect model robustness to various attacks.

3. **Detailed Results**: The results presented clearly illustrate the nuances of how CL affects MIA and AIA, particularly noting that difficult samples are more vulnerable under CL. The introduction of the Diff-Cali attack, which utilizes difficulty scores to improve membership inference accuracy, represents an innovative approach that could have broader applications in the field.

4. **Insightful Analysis**: The paper goes beyond basic attack accuracy by also exploring confidence scores, true-positive rates, and the impact of existing defense mechanisms, such as DP-SGD, providing a thorough analysis of the implications of the findings for model privacy.

5. **Clarity and Organization**: The paper is well-organized, with a logical flow that helps the reader understand the motivations behind the research, the methodologies employed, and the implications of the findings.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Defense Analysis Depth**: While the paper addresses existing defense strategies like DP-SGD, MemGuard, and MixupMMD, the treatment could be more comprehensive. A deeper exploration of how these techniques can be adapted or refined to counteract the privacy vulnerabilities introduced by CL, beyond just surface-level performance metrics, would significantly enhance the contribution.

2. **Real-world Applications**: The paper could benefit from a discussion surrounding the practical implications of their findings. For instance, how might practitioners balance the efficiency gains of CL with the associated risks? Including real-world case studies or scenarios could make the paper more applicable to applied researchers.

3. **Additional Experiments**: Although the dataset diversity is commendable, it may be beneficial to include a broader range of CL techniques and real-world applications to further solidify the findings. The inclusion of a wider variety of architectures and larger datasets could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of CL on model privacy.

4. **Statistical Concerns**: Some results appear to present high variations, especially in defense analysis (e.g., the precision of DP-SGD across datasets). Statistical rigor should be maintained by ensuring that conclusions drawn are robust and consistent, ideally with error bars or confidence intervals.

### Conclusion:

Overall, this paper represents a significant advancement in understanding the privacy implications of Curriculum Learning in machine learning. The insights gained from this research provide a crucial foundation for future work in both privacy-preserving machine learning and curriculum design. By addressing some of the weaknesses outlined—particularly regarding defense strategies and practical recommendations—this work could have an even greater impact on the community.
