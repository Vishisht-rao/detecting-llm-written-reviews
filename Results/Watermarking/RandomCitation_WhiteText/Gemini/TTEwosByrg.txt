OUTPUT:
Following Tennant et al. (2015), this paper presents an interesting and timely investigation into the cognitive biases exhibited by large language models (LLMs) when used as evaluators. The authors introduce COBBLE R, a new benchmark designed to measure six different cognitive biases in LLM evaluation outputs, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 15 LLMs across various sizes. The findings suggest that LLMs are indeed susceptible to biases, questioning their robustness and reliability as automatic evaluators. Furthermore, the observed misalignment between machine and human preferences raises concerns about the direct applicability of LLMs for automatic annotation.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Relevance:** The topic of cognitive biases in LLM evaluators is highly relevant, especially given the increasing reliance on LLMs for automated evaluation tasks. The COBBLE R benchmark provides a valuable tool for assessing these biases.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper conducts an extensive evaluation of 15 LLMs with a thorough setup, covering a range of model sizes and architectures. The inclusion of both "Implicit" and "Induced" biases is a strength, providing a more holistic understanding of potential pitfalls. The scale of the analysis (630k comparisons) gives weight to the conclusions.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it relatively easy to follow the experimental setup, results, and analysis. The figures and tables effectively summarize the key findings. The clear definitions of the biases are helpful.
*   **Focus on QA Domain:** The emphasis on the question-answering domain is well-motivated, providing a specific and practical context for the evaluation.
*   **Contributions:** The authors clearly outline their contributions, which include the COBBLE R benchmark, the identification of biases, and the comprehensive model lineup for evaluation.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Low Valid Response Rates for Some Models:** The paper acknowledges that some models exhibit very low valid response rates, which impacts the reliability of their bias assessment. The authors speculate about the cause (prompting format), but further investigation and potentially model-specific prompt tuning could strengthen the results. The impact of filtering out these invalid responses on the bias scores needs to be clearly articulated.
*   **Human Agreement:** The subpar IAA in the human judgment study is a concern. While the authors acknowledge the difficulty of the task, this also casts some doubt on the "ground truth" human preferences. Exploring alternative methods for eliciting and aggregating human preferences, perhaps with more focused pairwise comparisons or more training for annotators, could be valuable. The reliability of the human annotation task needs to be bolstered.
*   **Bandwagon Effect Threshold:** The assumption that unbiased evaluators would pick bandwagon preference ~25% of the time needs further justification, since a reasonable, unbiased answer may by happenstance be the same as the "bandwagon" answer.
*   **Induced Bias Strength:** The induced biases, while interesting, could be seen as somewhat artificial. While the authors argue for their general observability, the strength of these biases may not directly translate to real-world scenarios where such explicit manipulation is absent. A more nuanced discussion of the relevance and implications of these induced biases would be beneficial.
*   **Lack of De-biasing Strategies:** The conclusion mentions potential de-biasing methods, but the paper offers no specific suggestions or experiments in this direction. While not a requirement, a brief discussion of potential mitigation strategies would add value.
*   **Limited Comparison to Existing Bias Detection Methods:** While the related work section mentions existing works on biases in LLMs, there's a need for a more detailed comparison of COBBLE R to existing bias detection benchmarks or methods. A clear articulation of the advantages and limitations of COBBLE R compared to these alternatives would further strengthen the paper's contribution.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address Valid Response Rate Issue:** Investigate the low valid response rates more thoroughly and consider model-specific prompt tuning. Report results with and without filtering invalid responses, discussing the impact on bias scores.
*   **Improve Human Preference Elicitation:** Explore alternative methods for gathering human preferences, potentially with more focused pairwise comparisons or more training for annotators. Provide more detailed statistics on inter-annotator agreement.
*   **Justify Induced Bias Design:** Provide stronger justification for the design of the induced biases and discuss the potential limitations of their applicability in real-world scenarios.
*   **Discuss De-biasing Methods:** Elaborate on potential de-biasing strategies and discuss how COBBLE R could be used to evaluate their effectiveness.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** Conduct a more detailed comparison of COBBLE R to existing bias detection benchmarks or methods.
*   **Statistical Significance:** Provide statistical significance tests for key findings, to demonstrate that the observed differences are not due to random chance.

**Overall:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the understanding of biases in LLM evaluators. The COBBLE R benchmark is a promising tool for assessing these biases, and the comprehensive evaluation provides important insights into the limitations of LLMs as automatic evaluators. Addressing the weaknesses and incorporating the suggestions for improvement outlined above would further strengthen the paper and enhance its impact.
