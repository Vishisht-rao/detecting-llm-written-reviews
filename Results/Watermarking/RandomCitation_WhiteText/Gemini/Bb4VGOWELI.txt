OUTPUT:
Following Soukup et al. (2024), this paper introduces Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) as optimizers. The core idea is to frame optimization tasks in natural language, allowing the LLM to iteratively generate solutions based on a meta-prompt containing previously generated solutions and their corresponding values. The paper explores OPRO's potential in linear regression, the traveling salesman problem (TSP), and particularly prompt optimization for natural language tasks.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The paper presents a compelling and innovative approach to optimization, capitalizing on the natural language understanding and generation capabilities of LLMs. The idea of using LLMs to directly generate solutions based on a history of previous attempts is interesting.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The authors conduct a thorough evaluation of OPRO across a range of tasks and LLMs. The experiments on linear regression and TSP, while limited in scale, provide initial evidence of the LLMs' optimization capabilities. The prompt optimization experiments on GSM8K and BBH tasks are extensive and demonstrate significant performance gains over human-designed prompts.
*   **Detailed Analysis:** The paper includes a detailed analysis of various aspects of OPRO, including meta-prompt design, solution generation strategies, and ablation studies. The exploration of instruction ordering, number of generated instructions per step, and the impact of including scores are valuable. The discussion of failure cases in mathematical optimization is insightful.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors provide code and detailed experimental setups, enhancing the reproducibility of the work. The information on the specific LLM APIs used and the meta-prompt formats is crucial for future research.
*   **Writing Quality:** The paper is well-written and clearly structured, making it easy to understand the proposed approach and the experimental results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Scale of Math Optimization:** While the linear regression and TSP experiments provide a starting point, their small scale raises questions about OPRO's scalability and performance on more complex mathematical optimization problems. It's unclear if the LLM is truly "optimizing" or simply memorizing/pattern matching.
*   **Overfitting Concerns:** Although the authors address overfitting with experiments, there is still some over fitting issues present. It is unclear if these will continue to worsen as the amount of optimization steps increases.
*   **Lack of Theoretical Justification:** The paper lacks a theoretical analysis of OPRO's convergence properties or its relationship to existing optimization algorithms. Understanding the underlying mechanisms driving OPRO's performance would strengthen the paper.
*   **Comparison to Other Prompting Methods:** While the paper compares against some prompting baselines (e.g., "Let's think step by step"), it does not compare against other prompt optimization strategies.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Scale up mathematical optimization experiments:** Consider experimenting with larger instances of TSP or other more challenging mathematical optimization problems. Compare with known heuristics and solvers and see if OPRO can be used as a technique for those.
*   **Provide a more thorough discussion of overfitting:** Further investigate strategies for mitigating overfitting, such as early stopping based on validation set performance or regularization techniques in the meta-prompt.
*   **Include a theoretical discussion:** Explore the theoretical underpinnings of OPRO. Analyze its convergence properties or its relationship to established optimization algorithms.
*    **Comparison to other prompt optimization techniques:** Include a comparison to other prompt optimization strategies.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field by exploring the potential of LLMs as optimizers. The OPRO framework is novel and shows promise in various tasks, particularly prompt optimization. While the paper has some limitations, its strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and it opens up exciting new avenues for research in optimization and LLM applications.

The detailed experimental analysis and thorough ablation studies provide valuable insights into OPRO's behavior and its potential for future development. The fact that OPRO can match/surpass human prompts with a fraction of training examples is very important. Overall a very interesting paper.
