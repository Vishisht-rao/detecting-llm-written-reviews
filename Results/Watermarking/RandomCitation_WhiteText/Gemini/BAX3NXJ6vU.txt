OUTPUT:
Following Cyrus et al. (2021), this paper addresses the important problem of escaping saddle points in minimax and bilevel optimization, focusing on the nonconvex-strongly-concave and nonconvex-strongly-convex settings respectively. The authors propose a novel Perturbed Recursive Gradient Descent Ascent (PRGDA) algorithm which, crucially, uses only first-order information and is applicable to the stochastic setting. This is a significant contribution given the limitations of existing second-order methods that are often deterministic or computationally expensive.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The proposed PRGDA algorithm appears to be the first stochastic algorithm with guarantees of finding second-order stationary points for nonconvex minimax problems. The pure first-order nature of the algorithm is a significant practical advantage.
*   **Theoretical Results:** The gradient complexity results of $\tilde{O}(\kappa^3\epsilon^{-3})$ for minimax and $G_c(f, \epsilon) = \tilde{O}(\kappa^3\epsilon^{-3})$, $G_c(g, \epsilon) = \tilde{O}(\kappa^7\epsilon^{-3})$ for bilevel optimization, are highly competitive and, according to the authors, match state-of-the-art first-order methods. The improvement over existing second-order methods for bilevel problems like StocBiO + iNEON is a key strength.
*   **Practical Relevance:** Minimax and bilevel optimization are fundamental to many machine learning tasks (GANs, adversarial training, meta-learning, etc.), making improvements in their optimization highly impactful.
*   **Experiments:** The matrix sensing experiment provides empirical evidence to support the theoretical claims, demonstrating the algorithm's ability to escape saddle points compared to baselines. The hyper-representation learning experiments further highlight the utility of PRGDA in a Bilevel setting.
*   **Clarity of Writing:** The introduction clearly motivates the problem and summarizes the contributions. The related work section is comprehensive.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Complexity of the Algorithm:** While the algorithm is presented as "pure first-order," the numerous parameters (stepsizes, batchsizes, period, inner loop size, perturbation radius, threshold, average movement) and nested loops make it potentially difficult to tune in practice. This is a common issue with theoretically sound optimization algorithms, but it needs to be acknowledged. The choice of batch size might be prohibitive in some application scenarios, although the authors do provide extensions for finite-sum problems.
*   **Experimental Details:** While the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on matrix sensing, more details regarding hyperparameter tuning and sensitivity analysis would be beneficial. Specifically, the parameters are selected somewhat arbitrarily. It would strengthen the paper to conduct ablation studies of different hyperparameters to understand how each affect performance.
*   **Practical Consideration of Perturbation:** The perturbation step, a cornerstone for saddle point escaping, is a potential Achilles heel. The algorithm's performance strongly depends on setting the "perturbation radius" r, "average movement" $\bar{D}$, and "escaping phase threshold" $t_{thres}$. The experimental details provided for selecting these parameters appear insufficient.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Provide a more detailed discussion of how to choose the parameters for the algorithm. Some practical guidelines or rules of thumb for setting the various parameters would be helpful for practitioners. Explain the rationale behind their chosen values in the experiments. Ideally, a sensitivity analysis of the hyperparameters should be included.
*   **Experiment Diversity:** While matrix sensing is a valid test problem, expanding the experimental evaluation to other applications, such as adversarial training or GANs, would further demonstrate the generalizability of the algorithm.
*   **Comparison to Simpler Methods:** Consider comparing against a simple perturbed SGD baseline to isolate the benefits of the more sophisticated variance reduction techniques.
*   **Implementation Details:** Provide a pseudocode description of Algorithm 3. This makes the implementation of the algorithm easier to check and reimplement.
*   **Discussion of Limitations:** Acknowledge the limitations of the algorithm, particularly the sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning and the potential computational overhead of the variance reduction techniques in certain settings.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of minimax and bilevel optimization. The proposed PRGDA algorithm offers a promising approach to escaping saddle points in stochastic settings, with strong theoretical guarantees and supporting experimental results. While the practical considerations of hyperparameter tuning need further attention, the paper is well-written and technically sound. I recommend acceptance, conditional on addressing the points mentioned above to improve the clarity and practical applicability of the work.
