OUTPUT:
Following Ito et al. (2021), this paper presents a novel causality-inspired spatial-temporal explanation framework for Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DyGNNs). The paper addresses a critical gap in the interpretability of DyGNNs, which are increasingly used in various real-world applications but often lack transparency. The core idea is to construct a structural causal model (SCM) that disentangles complex relationships in dynamic graphs into trivial, static, and dynamic causal relationships. The proposed DyGNNExplainer utilizes a contrastive learning module and a dynamic correlating module to achieve this disentanglement and employs a dynamic VGAE-based framework for spatial and temporal interpretability.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The paper tackles a relevant and challenging problem in the field of graph neural networks. The application of causal inference to explain DyGNNs is a novel approach. The identification and disentanglement of trivial, static, and dynamic relationships within dynamic graphs is a significant contribution.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The proposed method is well-motivated and technically sound. The use of contrastive learning for disentangling trivial and causal relationships, along with the dynamic correlating module, appears to be a reasonable approach. The integration of a dynamic VGAE for spatial interpretability and causal intervention for temporal interpretability provides a comprehensive framework.
*   **Experimental Evaluation:** The paper presents comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DyGNNExplainer over existing static GNN explanation methods in terms of explanation fidelity, interpretability, and even prediction accuracy. The ablation study provides insights into the contribution of different components of the proposed framework.
*   **Reproducibility:** The availability of code and dataset benchmarks is a significant plus, promoting reproducibility and facilitating further research in the field.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is well-written and generally easy to follow, despite the technical complexity of the topic. The use of figures, especially Figure 1, aids in understanding the proposed framework.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Comparison:** The comparison is limited to static GNN explanation methods. While this is understandable given the lack of existing DyGNN explanation benchmarks, it would be beneficial to discuss how the proposed method compares to other related works in dynamic graph representation learning or time series analysis, even if they are not directly focused on interpretability. Some discussion of the computational cost would also be beneficial.
*   **Synthetic Data Generation:** The paper mentions dynamically transforming static datasets to create dynamic ones. A more detailed explanation of this transformation process is needed to better understand the characteristics and potential limitations of the generated datasets. In the appendix, there is more information, but a summary in the main body would be helpful.
*   **Parameter Sensitivity:** The paper mentions the tuning of hyperparameters. A sensitivity analysis of the key hyperparameters, such as the weights for different loss terms (λ1, λ2, λ3, λ4) and the temperature coefficient (τ), would be helpful to understand the robustness of the method.
*   **Clarity on Causal Intervention:** While the paper mentions backdoor adjustment, the practical implementation of the `do`-calculus and the exact form of the intervention could be made more explicit. How is `P(Y|do(C))` actually estimated?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand Comparison:** Include a broader discussion of related work, even if not directly comparable, to contextualize the contributions of the paper.
*   **Elaborate on Synthetic Data:** Provide a more detailed explanation of the synthetic data generation process in the main body of the paper.
*   **Add Sensitivity Analysis:** Include a sensitivity analysis of key hyperparameters to assess the robustness of the method.
*   **Clarify Causal Intervention:** Provide a more explicit explanation of the implementation of backdoor adjustment and the intervention process.
*   **Discuss Limitations:** Explicitly discuss the limitations of the proposed method, such as computational complexity or potential biases in the synthetic data.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of DyGNN interpretability. The proposed method is novel, technically sound, and experimentally validated. The paper is well-written and the code and dataset benchmarks are publicly available. Despite the minor weaknesses mentioned above, the paper is of high quality and warrants acceptance.
