OUTPUT:
Following Schuller et al. (2018), this paper introduces a novel approach to link prediction using a learnable eigenbasis derived from the Laplacian matrix with linear constraints, termed Learnable Lanczos Layer with Linear Constraints (LLwLC). The motivation stems from the limitations of Message Passing Graph Neural Networks (MPNNs) in node-level tasks, particularly their inability to distinguish between certain graph structures like k-regular graphs, which are crucial for tasks like triangle counting and thus, link prediction. The paper proposes encoding link representations and induced subgraphs efficiently by formulating the problem as an eigenvalue problem with linear constraints solved via a novel learnable Lanczos algorithm with linear constraints (LLwLC). The authors specifically explore Neumann eigenvalues and their corresponding constraints, showing they can differentiate between k-regular graphs. They also provide theoretical analysis and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on benchmark link prediction datasets.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The proposed LLwLC method and the application of Neumann eigenvalues to encode link representations are novel and offer a potential solution to the expressivity limitations of MPNNs. The idea of incorporating linear constraints derived from subgraphs directly into the eigenbasis is a significant contribution.
*   **Theoretical Analysis:** The paper includes a theoretical analysis of the LLwLC eigenbasis, including convergence proofs and discussions on approximation error bounds. The theorems relating the method's expressiveness to graph isomorphism and the reconstruction conjecture provide a solid theoretical foundation.
*   **Empirical Results:** The experiments demonstrate strong performance on several benchmark datasets, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in many cases, often with fewer parameters. The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of different linear constraints and the overall architecture.
*   **Clarity (Mixed):** The introduction clearly states the problem, the proposed solution, and the contributions. The method section attempts to explain the rather complex mathematics, but could benefit from more detailed, intuitive explanations.
*   **Well-Organized:** The paper follows a logical structure with clear sections for introduction, related work, method, experiments, and conclusion.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity (Mathematical Details):** While the general idea is conveyed well, the mathematical details of the Lanczos algorithm with linear constraints and the practical implementation within PyTorch are not entirely clear. For example, more elaboration on exactly *how* the constraints are encoded into the constraint matrix C is required. The explanation of projecting into the null space N(C‚ä§) could be improved. The description of solving the least-squares problem, especially how it's done practically with PyTorch's QR factorization while maintaining backpropagation, needs more clarity.
*   **Implementation Details:** While the experimental setup is described, more specific implementation details would be beneficial for reproducibility. For example: How are the initial vectors for Lanczos initialized? How is the orthogonal projector *P* computed, and what optimizations (if any) are used? The details on the MLP architecture (number of layers, activation functions) and training parameters (batch size, optimizer) should be specified.
*   **Comparison with Baselines:** It would be beneficial to provide a more in-depth analysis of why LLwLC outperforms the baselines. The paper mentions that SEAL and BUDDY have oversimplified pairwise node representations, but a more concrete explanation, supported by analysis of the learned representations, would strengthen the claims. What aspects of the learned basis enable the method to perform better for link prediction? Also, including runtime comparisons with existing methods will improve clarity.
*   **Scalability:** While the time complexity analysis suggests linear scaling, there is little empirical evidence on the scalability of the method. Experiments on larger graphs or a discussion of the limitations of the current implementation would be helpful. How does the performance change when *k* (the number of constraints) approaches *n*?

**Suggestions:**

*   **Improve Clarity:** Revise the method section to provide a more detailed and intuitive explanation of the mathematical concepts and implementation details. Use more visual aids (diagrams) to illustrate the Lanczos algorithm and the encoding of constraints. Provide pseudocode for the core algorithm.
*   **Expand Implementation Details:** Include more specific information about the experimental setup and implementation details to improve reproducibility.
*   **More In-Depth Analysis:** Provide a more detailed analysis of the learned representations and explain why LLwLC outperforms the baselines. Visualize the learned eigenbasis for some simple graphs, showing the effect of the constraints.
*   **Address Scalability:** Discuss the scalability limitations of the method and consider experiments on larger graphs.
*   **Minor Point:** There are some inconsistencies in the notation (e.g., sometimes using bold font for vectors and sometimes not). Consistent notation throughout the paper would improve readability.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a promising approach to link prediction by addressing the expressivity limitations of MPNNs. The proposed LLwLC method is novel, theoretically grounded, and empirically validated. While the paper has some weaknesses in clarity and implementation details, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. With some revisions to address the concerns outlined above, this paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.

I recommend this paper for acceptance, contingent upon addressing the issues raised in this review. The current ICLR rating would be a 6 - marginally above acceptance threshold.
