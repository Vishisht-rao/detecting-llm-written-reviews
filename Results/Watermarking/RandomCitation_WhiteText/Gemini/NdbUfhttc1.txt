OUTPUT:
Following Priest et al. (2024), this paper tackles the challenging problem of learning optimizers for reinforcement learning (RL), a domain where traditional learned optimizers designed for supervised learning (SL) often fail. The paper identifies three key issues hindering the application of learned optimizers in RL: the non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) nature of agent-gradient distributions, the difficulty in accurately representing parameter updates due to the wide logarithmic range of gradients, and the high bias and variance of agent-gradients resulting from stochastic agent-environment interactions. To address these issues, the authors propose Optim4RL, a novel learned optimizer that incorporates gradient processing, pipeline training, and a specialized optimizer structure with good inductive bias. The experimental results demonstrate that Optim4RL can be trained from scratch in simple toy tasks and generalize to more complex, unseen tasks in the Brax environment, outperforming state-of-the-art SL learned optimizers.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Identification:** The paper clearly articulates the unique challenges of learning optimizers for RL, providing a valuable contribution to the field by highlighting the limitations of applying SL-based techniques directly to RL. The analysis of the agent-gradient distribution's non-iid nature and the difficulty of approximating identity functions with raw gradients are particularly insightful.
*   **Novel Approach:** The proposed Optim4RL framework is well-motivated and incorporates several innovative components. Gradient processing addresses the issue of varying gradient scales, pipeline training promotes a more iid input distribution, and the designed optimizer structure provides a beneficial inductive bias. The combination of these techniques contributes to the effectiveness of Optim4RL.
*   **Strong Experimental Results:** The experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of Optim4RL in both gridworld and Brax environments. The results clearly show that Optim4RL can be trained from scratch and generalize to unseen tasks, outperforming several baseline optimizers, including state-of-the-art SL learned optimizers like VeLO. The ablation study highlights the importance of pipeline training and the chosen inductive bias.
*   **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is well-written and organized, making it easy to understand the problem, the proposed solution, and the experimental results. The figures and tables are informative and contribute to the overall clarity of the presentation.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Scope of Meta-Training:** While the generalization results are impressive, the meta-training environment is relatively limited (six gridworld tasks). The paper acknowledges this limitation but further discussion on the potential impact of a more diverse meta-training dataset on the performance and generalization ability of Optim4RL would be beneficial. A discussion on negative transfer might also be valuable.
*   **Computational Resources:** Although the authors state that the computation required to replicate their results is not high, more specific details regarding the resources used (e.g., number of GPUs, training time) would enhance the reproducibility of the work.
*   **Theoretical Analysis:** While the paper provides a strong empirical evaluation, a more in-depth theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of Optim4RL would further strengthen the contribution. This could involve analyzing the stability of the learning process or providing guarantees on the performance of the learned optimizer.
*   **Justification of Hyperparameter Choice:** While the paper provides a range for hyperparameters, there's a lack of explanation about how the *best* hyperparameter values were selected. A more detailed explanation would improve reproducibility.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand Discussion on Meta-Training Data:** Provide a more detailed discussion on how the specific gridworld tasks were chosen and how they are representative of RL tasks in general. Consider discussing the potential benefits and challenges of using a more diverse meta-training dataset.
*   **Elaborate on Computational Resources:** Include more precise information about the computational resources used for training and evaluation.
*   **Consider Adding a Theoretical Analysis:** Explore the possibility of including a theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of Optim4RL.
*   **Justify Hyperparameter Choices:** Explain how the final hyperparameter choices were selected.
*   **Minor Grammatical Issue:** The term "coordinatewisely" in Section 5.3 is not standard English. Consider rephrasing to "coordinate-wise" or "element-wise."

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that addresses an important and challenging problem in the field of reinforcement learning. The proposed Optim4RL framework is well-motivated, incorporates several innovative components, and demonstrates impressive empirical results. Despite the minor weaknesses mentioned above, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field and is likely to be of interest to researchers working on learned optimization and reinforcement learning.
