OUTPUT:
Following Dunston et al. (2015), this paper presents a novel approach to solving unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) and partial unbalanced optimal transport (PUOT) problems, leveraging transform coefficients to determine marginal probability distributions. The core idea is to bypass direct computation of the coupling matrix, instead focusing on adjusting sample weights, and ultimately transforming the UOT/PUOT problem into a classical OT problem. The paper further introduces a cost-reweighted OT (CROT) method to achieve sparser and more accurate matching solutions, guided by Lagrange multipliers obtained during the transform coefficient calculation. The paper includes theoretical derivations, algorithmic descriptions, and experimental evaluations.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The transform coefficient approach offers a fresh perspective on UOT/PUOT, differing from entropy regularization and direct penalized regression methods. The transformation to a classical OT problem is an interesting theoretical contribution.
*   **Clarity of Presentation (Mixed):** The paper attempts to clearly articulate the methodology. The KKT conditions and optimization steps are laid out in detail. However, a couple of spots seem confusing and should be reworked.
*   **Potential Impact:** The ability to solve UOT/PUOT efficiently and sparsely has broad applications in machine learning, as highlighted in the introduction. The CROT method provides a practical approach to improving the quality of OT solutions.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in various scenarios, including outlier removal and domain adaptation. The time consumption analysis provides evidence of the computational efficiency. The analysis of multipliers s gives interesting insights.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity of Presentation (Mixed):** While the paper aims for clarity, the notation is sometimes dense and difficult to follow. Some equations could benefit from further explanation. For example, the definition of transformed pairwise distance `bC*_{i,j}` is used before it is clearly defined. While this is likely a typo, since `bC_{i,j}` is used later in the equation definition, such oversights add to difficulty of reading. Also, Proposition 1 seems to have typos.
*   **Related Work:** The related work section could be expanded to include more recent and relevant UOT and sparse OT solvers. A more thorough comparison to existing methods is needed to fully appreciate the advantages of the proposed approach. It might be useful to classify various OT methods that apply coefficient transform methods (such as cost or initial marginals).
*   **Justification of CROT:** The motivation behind CROT, while intuitive, could benefit from more rigorous justification. Is there a theoretical guarantee that reweighting the cost matrix with multipliers leads to a better solution? It appears there is a large sensitivity in hyperparameter `\eta`.
*   **Lack of Theoretical Justification:** While empirical experiments indicate that the method works well, it could be a good idea to spend more time justifying the approach or discussing settings in which the method is expected to fail.
*   **Typos and Grammatical Errors:** The paper contains several typos and grammatical errors (e.g., "inaccurate results" should be "inaccurate matching results") that detract from its readability and professionalism. Careful proofreading is required.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Improve Clarity:** Simplify the notation, provide more detailed explanations for key equations, and ensure consistent notation throughout the paper.
*   **Expand Related Work:** Conduct a more comprehensive review of existing UOT and sparse OT methods, highlighting the limitations of current approaches and clearly articulating the advantages of the proposed method.
*   **Provide Theoretical Justification:** Investigate the theoretical properties of CROT and provide some justification to guarantee that it works well.
*   **Address Sensitivity:** Address the sensitivity in hyperparameter `\eta`, provide heuristics or justifications for how to choose the parameter.
*   **Proofread Carefully:** Thoroughly proofread the paper to eliminate typos and grammatical errors.
*   **Consider Open Sourcing Code:** To increase the impact of this method, authors might consider open sourcing code.

**Overall Assessment:**

The paper presents a promising new approach to solving UOT/PUOT problems. While the paper has some weaknesses in terms of clarity, related work, and theoretical justification, the novelty of the transform coefficient method and the potential for achieving sparse and accurate solutions make it a worthwhile contribution to the field. With revisions to address the weaknesses outlined above, this paper has the potential to be a valuable addition to the ICLR 2024 conference.
