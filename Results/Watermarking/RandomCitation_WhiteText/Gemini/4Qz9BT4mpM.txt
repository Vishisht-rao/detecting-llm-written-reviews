OUTPUT:
Following Livesay et al. (2020), this paper tackles an important and timely problem: estimating the out-of-distribution (OOD) performance of fine-tuned foundation models (FMs) without relying on labeled OOD data. This is crucial for safely deploying these models in real-world scenarios where obtaining labeled data for every possible distribution shift is impractical. The authors build upon the "agreement-on-the-line" (AGL) phenomenon, previously demonstrated for models trained from scratch, and investigate its applicability to fine-tuned FMs.

**Strengths:**

*   **Relevance:** The paper addresses a very relevant and pressing problem in the machine learning community. With the increasing prevalence of fine-tuned FMs, reliable OOD performance estimation methods are highly valuable.
*   **Clear Problem Definition:** The problem is well-defined, and the authors clearly explain the challenges associated with applying existing AGL-based methods to fine-tuned FMs (e.g., lack of diversity).
*   **Systematic Investigation:** The paper presents a thorough and systematic investigation of different sources of randomness (linear head initialization, data shuffling, data subsetting) for inducing diversity in single-FM fine-tuning scenarios. The finding that random linear head initialization is surprisingly effective is a key contribution.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The authors provide extensive empirical results on various datasets and modalities (image classification, question answering, text classification) to support their claims. The use of CIFAR10C, SQuAD-Shifts, Office-Home, and WILDS benchmarks adds credibility to the findings.
*   **Surprising and Interesting Results:** The paper reveals some non-trivial and surprising findings, such as the effectiveness of random head initialization and the observation that FMs fine-tuned from diverse base models can lie on the same accuracy line. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of AGL and robustness in FMs.
*   **Well-Written:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, with a clear structure and logical flow.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors provide details about their experimental setup and plan to release code, which enhances reproducibility.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Theoretical Justification:** While the paper presents compelling empirical evidence, it lacks a strong theoretical justification for why random linear head initialization is so effective in inducing AGL behavior. A more in-depth analysis of the underlying mechanisms would strengthen the paper. While there is mention to prior work providing some theoretical underpinning, this is not elaborated on.
*   **Dependency on ACL Assumption:** The AGL approach relies on the "accuracy-on-the-line" (ACL) phenomenon, which is not guaranteed to hold for all distribution shifts. While the authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest checking for linear correlations, it would be beneficial to discuss the types of shifts where AGL is likely to fail and potential mitigation strategies. Perhaps, a simple check to see the variance of each model would be of benefit.
*   **Limited Comparison to other OOD estimation methods:** The comparison of ALine to other OOD estimation methods is a bit limited. Further investigation into other SOTA OOD estimation methods could strengthen the paper, or discussion about the limitations of other methods that make them not ideal for the study conducted.
*   **Lack of Discussion on Computational Cost:** While the authors mention that their study is computationally tractable, a more detailed discussion of the computational cost associated with fine-tuning multiple FMs (even lightly) would be valuable for practitioners.
*   **Ethics Statement:** The ethics statement is a bit general. While it acknowledges potential limitations and biases, it could be more specific about the ethical considerations related to the deployment of FMs in different domains and the potential for unintended consequences. In particular, could the fine-tuning step add bias that the base model does not possess?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Provide more theoretical insights:** Delve deeper into the reasons behind the effectiveness of random linear head initialization. Can this be related to implicit regularization or the exploration of different basins in the loss landscape?
*   **Discuss limitations of AGL:** Elaborate on the types of distribution shifts where AGL is likely to fail and potential solutions or alternative approaches for those scenarios.
*   **Expand Comparison of SOTA OOD Estimation Methods** Provide a more in-depth discussion or investigation of other SOTA OOD Estimation Methods.
*   **Clarify Computational Costs:** Provide a more precise estimate of the computational resources required for fine-tuning multiple FMs with the proposed methods.
*   **Strengthen the Ethics Statement:** Provide a more detailed and nuanced discussion of the potential ethical implications of deploying FMs based on AGL-estimated OOD performance, especially in sensitive applications. Elaborate if the fine-tuning step can add bias.
*   **Minor Clarification:** The description in the abstract notes, "Again rather surprisingly, we demonstrate that these models exhibit some key similarity, that causes them all to lie on the same agreement line". It would be helpful to briefly mention what that key similarity is, so that the reader does not need to refer to the body.

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of OOD performance estimation for fine-tuned foundation models. The systematic investigation, empirical results, and surprising findings make it a strong candidate for acceptance. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further enhance the paper's impact and significance. I recommend this paper for acceptance to ICLR 2024, contingent on addressing the above noted points.
