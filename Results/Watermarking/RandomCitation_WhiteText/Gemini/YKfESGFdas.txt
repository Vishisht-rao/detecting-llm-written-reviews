OUTPUT:
Following Tipton et al. (2021), this paper introduces GeONet, a neural operator designed to learn the Wasserstein geodesic between probability distributions. The core idea is to learn the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions of the Benamou-Brenier dynamic optimal transport formulation, characterized by a coupled PDE system in primal and dual spaces. The paper claims GeONet achieves comparable accuracy to traditional OT solvers with significantly reduced inference costs and demonstrates its applicability in scenarios including Gaussian mixture distributions (both continuous and discrete) and the MNIST dataset after encoding. The paper emphasizes the mesh-invariant nature of GeONet, enabling zero-shot super-resolution capabilities.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Approach:** Applying neural operators to learn the Wasserstein geodesic is a compelling idea. The formulation based on the dynamic OT problem and learning the KKT conditions offers a promising route to overcome the computational bottlenecks of traditional OT solvers.
*   **Mesh Invariance:** The mesh-independent nature of GeONet is a significant advantage. The ability to perform zero-shot super-resolution, demonstrated in the paper, showcases the practicality of this feature.
*   **Computational Efficiency:** The paper highlights the reduced inference cost compared to standard OT methods. The runtime comparison with POT (Python Optimal Transport) illustrates this speedup, particularly for finer grids, which is crucial for real-time applications and large-scale datasets.
*   **Versatility:** GeONet is presented as being versatile in handling both continuous densities (Gaussian mixtures) and discrete point clouds. The MNIST example, while requiring an autoencoder for pre-processing, shows the potential to apply the method to real-world data.
*   **Well-Structured Paper:** The paper is generally well-structured, with a clear introduction of the problem, method, and results. The background section provides necessary context on optimal transport and neural operators.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Novelty Compared to Existing Neural Operator Architectures:** While the application to Wasserstein geodesics is novel, the core neural network architecture is based on DeepONet. The paper could benefit from more emphasis on architectural innovations specifically tailored for this problem. The "enhanced" DeepONet version isn't sufficiently elaborated upon, leaving it unclear what specific modifications were made.
*   **Lack of Detail on the "Modified MLP":** The reference to a "modified MLP architecture" from Wang et al. (2021a) requires the reader to consult another paper to understand the implementation details. Including a brief description of the modifications within the appendix would improve the paper's self-containedness.
*   **Insufficient Ablation Studies:** The paper lacks sufficient ablation studies to justify the design choices of GeONet. For instance, it would be beneficial to investigate the impact of different neural operator architectures, the weighting of the physics-informed loss terms (α1, α2, β0, β1), and the dimension *p* of the branch and trunk networks.
*   **Clarity on Error Metrics:** While the paper reports L1 errors, more detail on how these errors are calculated is needed. For example, are the errors averaged over space and time? A more rigorous definition of the error metric will strengthen the validity of the results.
*   **Justification of the Autoencoder for MNIST:** The use of a pre-trained autoencoder for the MNIST dataset is somewhat ad-hoc. While the paper acknowledges the challenges of applying GeONet directly to the raw pixel data, a more detailed explanation of why this is the case and a discussion of alternative approaches would be valuable. Also, the error calculations are performed in both the latent and image space. While this information is informative, more analysis as to why the results do not coincide as well as what the downstream implications of these errors are is missing.
*   **Limited Comparison to Other ML-based OT Methods:** The paper mentions existing machine learning methods for computing Wasserstein geodesics (Liu et al., 2021; 2023; Pooladian et al., 2023; Tong et al., 2023; Lacombe et al. (2023); Amos et al. (2023)). However, the experimental section focuses primarily on comparisons with traditional OT solvers. Including a comparison with other relevant machine learning approaches would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of GeONet's performance.
*   **Discussion of Generalization Error:** The paper acknowledges the regularity of the OT problem but notes the absence of a generalization error bound. While this is understandable given the complexity of the problem, a discussion of factors influencing the generalization performance of GeONet (e.g., the size and diversity of the training data, the choice of network architecture) would be beneficial.
*   **Limitations section could be more elaborate:** The current limitations section is brief. Elaborating on each of the mentioned limitations as well as possibly providing solutions/future work to remedy these areas will strengthen the paper.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Elaborate on the "Enhanced" DeepONet Architecture:** Provide more detail on the specific modifications made to the DeepONet architecture for GeONet.
*   **Include a Description of the Modified MLP:** Add a brief description of the modified MLP architecture used in the experiments.
*   **Conduct Ablation Studies:** Perform ablation studies to justify the design choices of GeONet.
*   **Provide More Details on Error Metrics:** Clarify how the L1 errors are calculated.
*   **Add ML-based OT Comparison:** Include a comparative benchmark with other machine-learning based optimal transport methods.
*   **Discuss Generalization Error:** Provide a theoretical justification for performance claims.
*   **Expand the Limitations Section:** Elaborate on the limitations of GeONet and potential directions for future research.

**Overall Assessment:**

The paper presents a novel and promising approach for learning Wasserstein geodesics using neural operators. GeONet's mesh-invariant nature and potential for reduced inference costs make it a valuable contribution to the field of computational optimal transport. However, the paper could be strengthened by providing more detail on the architectural innovations, conducting more thorough ablation studies, including comparisons with other ML-based OT methods, and providing a discussion of generalization performance. Addressing these weaknesses will significantly improve the quality and impact of the paper.

**Rating:** 6/10 (Acceptable, but needs significant improvements)
