OUTPUT:
Following Steiger et al. (2018), this paper presents a theoretical analysis of Variance Exploding (VE) diffusion models under the manifold hypothesis. The authors identify a limitation in existing theoretical work on VE models, namely a slower forward process convergence rate compared to Variance Preserving (VP) models. To address this, they propose a novel forward VESDE process with a small drift term and allow for unbounded diffusion coefficients. This new process, they argue, achieves a faster convergence rate and enables the first polynomial sample complexity result for VE-based models with reverse SDEs, under the manifold hypothesis. The paper then extends the analysis to a more general setting, considering both reverse SDEs and probability flow ODEs through a unified tangent-based framework. They claim to provide the first quantitative convergence guarantee for SOTA VE-based models with probability flow ODEs. Synthetic experiments are included to support the theoretical findings.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The proposed forward VESDE process with a drift term and unbounded diffusion coefficient is a novel contribution and addresses a known limitation of existing VE models.
*   **Theoretical Contribution:** The paper provides theoretical guarantees (polynomial sample complexity, convergence guarantees) for VE models under the manifold hypothesis, which is a significant contribution to the field. The unified tangent-based framework for reverse SDEs and PFODEs is also a valuable contribution.
*   **Relevance:** Diffusion models are a highly active research area, and improving the theoretical understanding of VE models is of considerable importance. The connection to SOTA models (Karras et al., 2022) increases the practical relevance.
*   **Clarity (Overall):** The paper is generally well-written and clearly outlines the problem, the proposed solution, and the main results.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The synthetic experiments provide some empirical support for the theoretical claims.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Aggressiveness of Assumptions:** While the manifold hypothesis is a reasonable assumption, the assumption of uniform L2-accuracy on scores (Assumption 3) may be restrictive. The dependency of the theoretical results on the quality of score estimation is a crucial aspect that warrants further discussion. Similarly, the assumption regarding the growth of βt (Assumption 1) could be seen as limiting, even though the authors argue for its generality. A more in-depth justification of the real-world applicability of these assumptions would strengthen the paper.
*   **Practical Implications:** The polynomial sample complexity result, while theoretically significant, needs further interpretation in terms of its practical implications. How does this complexity scale with the dimensionality of the data, and what are the bottlenecks in applying these results to real-world datasets (e.g., image generation)? A discussion on the constants hidden by the O(.) notation would be beneficial.
*   **Experimental Detail:** The experimental section is relatively limited. Expanding the experimental validation with more complex datasets or comparing against existing VE model implementations would increase the impact. Specific details regarding the experimental setup (e.g., hyperparameter choices) are lacking.
*   **Tangent-Based Framework (Corollary 3):** The assumption on the Hessian (∇<sup>2</sup>log *q*<sub>*t*</sub>(*x*<sub>*t*</sub>) ≤ Γ/*σ*<sup>2</sup><sub>*t*</sub>) in Corollary 3, while acknowledged as potentially stronger, needs further justification regarding its real-world applicability. While the authors mention the hypercube example, exploring other relevant scenarios where this assumption holds would be valuable.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Assumption Justification:** Provide a more thorough justification for the key assumptions (Assumption 1 and 3, and the Hessian bound in Corollary 3), including a discussion of their limitations and applicability to real-world data.
*   **Complexity Analysis:** Elaborate on the practical implications of the polynomial sample complexity result, including a discussion of the scaling behavior and potential bottlenecks.
*   **Experimental Expansion:** Expand the experimental section with more complex datasets and comparisons against existing VE model implementations. Provide more detailed information about the experimental setup and hyperparameter choices.
*   **Clarity on Contributions:** While the paper claims novelty, it would benefit from a more direct comparison with the existing works mentioned, highlighting the specific differences and advantages of the proposed method.
*   **Typos:**  A careful proofread would be beneficial to eliminate the few typos.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a valuable theoretical contribution to the understanding of VE diffusion models. The proposed forward VESDE process and the unified tangent-based framework are novel and potentially impactful. While the paper has some weaknesses, particularly regarding the assumptions and experimental validation, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. This paper is worthy of acceptance, contingent upon addressing the suggested improvements.
