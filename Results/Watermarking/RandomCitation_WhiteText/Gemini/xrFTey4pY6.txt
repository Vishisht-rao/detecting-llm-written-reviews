OUTPUT:
Following Danner et al. (2015), this paper introduces CLARIFY, a novel interactive method for correcting model misconceptions in image classification using natural language feedback. The core idea is to allow users to provide targeted textual descriptions of model failure patterns, which are then automatically used to reweight the training data or gather additional data. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of CLARIFY through experiments on datasets with spurious correlations (Waterbirds, CelebA) and on a large-scale dataset (ImageNet), showing improvements in worst-group accuracy and discovery of novel spurious correlations.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The paper addresses a crucial problem in machine learning â€“ the reliance on spurious correlations. The proposed interactive approach is a novel and potentially impactful way to incorporate human knowledge and steer models towards more robust and generalizable behavior. The focus on concept-level feedback and negative knowledge is a refreshing departure from instance-level annotation.
*   **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The problem is clearly articulated, the proposed method is well-explained (especially the interaction workflow), and the experimental results are presented in a clear and concise manner. The figures are helpful in visualizing the CLARIFY interface and the discovered spurious correlations.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The experimental results provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of CLARIFY. The comparisons with existing methods (zero-shot CLIP, DFR, Group DRO) demonstrate that CLARIFY can achieve competitive or superior performance with minimal human supervision. The user study with non-expert annotators shows that the interface is user-friendly and that non-experts can effectively identify and describe model errors. The discovery and rectification of spurious correlations in ImageNet highlights the scalability of the approach.
*   **Scalability Argument:** The argument for scalability to large datasets such as ImageNet is well made. The paper demonstrates this empirically. This is a key differentiator from many other methods for addressing spurious correlations.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **CLIP Reliance:** The reliance on CLIP for measuring image-text similarity could be a limitation in specialized domains where CLIP may not perform well. While acknowledged in the discussion, exploring alternative or fine-tuned multimodal models might strengthen the method. The performance of CLIP is critical to the success of the annotation interface.
*   **Limited Hyperparameter Tuning:** While the paper argues that the automated finetuning step has no additional hyperparameters, the Error Score metric relies on a similarity threshold that needs to be set, either by the user or automatically. How sensitive are the results to the choice of this threshold? A sensitivity analysis would be helpful.
*   **Error Score Metric:** The Error Score metric provides a proxy for description quality. Its direct connection to training improvements could be better illustrated. While it's stated as not being used in the training process, its effectiveness in helping users guide their annotations could be more rigorously examined.
*   **Comparison to Automated Methods:** While the paper argues that the experiments are not intended to be head-to-head, the choice of baselines could be more comprehensive. Including more recent and state-of-the-art automated methods for addressing spurious correlations, even if only on the Waterbirds and CelebA datasets, would provide a stronger context for the performance of CLARIFY.

**Questions for the authors:**

*   How does the performance of CLARIFY vary with the quality of the initial model used for training?
*   What strategies can be employed to mitigate the limitations of relying solely on CLIP for image-text similarity, especially in specialized domains?
*   Could you elaborate on the sensitivity of the results to the choice of the similarity threshold used for partitioning the data based on the text prompt?
*   How could automated bias discovery methods be more tightly integrated into the CLARIFY framework to further reduce the annotation burden?

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective method for interactively correcting model misconceptions. The clarity of the presentation, the thorough empirical validation, and the insightful discussion of limitations make this a valuable contribution to the field. The weaknesses are relatively minor and do not detract significantly from the overall quality of the work. I recommend acceptance.
