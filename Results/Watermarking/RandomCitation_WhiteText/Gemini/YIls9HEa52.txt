OUTPUT:
Following Hudnall et al. (2020), this paper introduces the infinite recurrent switching linear dynamical system (irSLDS), a novel extension to the recurrent switching linear dynamical system (rSLDS) framework. The core innovation lies in replacing the fixed cardinality Hidden Markov Model (HMM) prior over discrete states with a semi-Markov discrete state process governed by a heat-equation-based prior. This allows for a variable number of states across trials and induces a geometry on the discrete state space, addressing limitations of the traditional rSLDS model. The paper argues that this approach offers improved interpretability and flexibility, particularly in scenarios with non-stationary dynamics.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The irSLDS model is a significant contribution to the field of state-space modeling, offering a compelling solution to the limitations of fixed-state HMMs in capturing complex neural dynamics. The use of PDE theory to derive the prior is a creative and technically interesting approach.

*   **Clarity of Problem Statement:** The paper clearly articulates the shortcomings of existing rSLDS models and motivates the need for a model with flexible state cardinality and latent state geometry. The introduction effectively sets the stage for the proposed irSLDS model.

*   **Technical Depth:** The paper delves into the mathematical details of the irSLDS model, including the derivation of the PDE prior, the discussion of PÃ³lya-gamma augmentation, and the implementation details for generation and inference. This level of technical detail demonstrates a strong understanding of the underlying theory.

*   **Empirical Validation:** The paper presents a thorough empirical evaluation of the irSLDS model, comparing its performance against the rSLDS and SLDS models on both synthetic and real neural data. The experiments on the NASCAR task effectively demonstrate the model's ability to capture recurrent dynamics and adapt to non-stationary environments. The application to IBL electrophysiological data provides compelling evidence for the model's ability to uncover trial-varying structure and geometric drift in neural dynamics.

*   **Code Availability (Implied):** The paper mentions building upon the SSM package, strongly implying the code will be made available, which is essential for reproducibility and adoption by the community.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity of Explanation of PDE Prior:** While the paper provides a good overview of the mathematical formulation, the intuitive understanding of *why* the heat equation is a good choice for the prior could be enhanced. More explanation on the link between the diffusion of probabilities and the desired properties of the model is needed.

*   **Computational Complexity:** The paper acknowledges the increased computational complexity of the irSLDS model, particularly due to the recurrent dynamics of the transition matrix. While the use of a parallel scan operation is presented as a solution, the implementation's limitations regarding automatic differentiation are a concern. The empirical running times (Table 4) highlight a significant performance difference, and a more detailed discussion of the computational trade-offs would be beneficial. Furthermore, the scan's current lack of compatibility with automatic differentiation is a significant practical limitation.

*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** While the paper shows robustness for the given hyperparameter settings, more detailed sensitivity analyses could strengthen the experimental results. Fig 6 showed that high values of k lead to more clearly defined states. Is this generally the case?

*   **Limited Exploration of Discrete State Geometry:** The paper introduces the concept of discrete state geometry, but only provides a limited example of its use in defining intermediate states. A more in-depth exploration of the potential applications of this geometry would be valuable. The interpretation of the geometry and how it relates to actual brain function could be explored more deeply.

*   **Reproducibility Details:** While the code availability is implied, specific details about the software environment and dependencies would further enhance reproducibility.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Elaborate on the intuition behind the heat equation prior:** Provide a more intuitive explanation of why the heat equation is a suitable choice for modeling the dynamics of the transition matrix. Discuss how the diffusion of probabilities relates to the desired properties of the model, such as capturing non-stationary dynamics and inducing a geometry on the state space.
*   **Address the limitations of the parallel scan implementation:** Acknowledge that the scan is not used for training (and why). Provide a more detailed discussion of alternative optimization strategies that could address the computational challenges of the irSLDS model. Are there approximation methods, such as variational inference with a structured approximation to the scan computation, that could be explored?
*   **Expand the exploration of discrete state geometry:** Provide more examples of how the geometry on the discrete state space can be leveraged for analysis and interpretation. Discuss potential applications such as interpolating between states, identifying clusters of related states, or visualizing the evolution of the system in the latent state space.
*   **Provide more details on reproducibility:** Include specific details about the software environment, dependencies, and data preprocessing steps to enhance the reproducibility of the results.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and technically sound extension to the rSLDS framework. The irSLDS model addresses important limitations of existing state-space models and offers a compelling approach for analyzing complex neural dynamics. While the paper has some weaknesses, particularly regarding computational complexity and the exploration of discrete state geometry, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, and the paper makes a significant contribution to the field. The paper is well-written, clearly motivated, and supported by strong empirical evidence. I recommend acceptance, pending minor revisions to address the suggestions outlined above.
