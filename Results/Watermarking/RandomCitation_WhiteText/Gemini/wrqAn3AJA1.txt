OUTPUT:
Following Sampson et al. (2022), this paper introduces HELP (Hierarchical Explainable Latent Pooling), a novel graph pooling method designed for inherently interpretable graph neural networks (GNNs). The core idea is to iteratively pool graphs into coarser representations by clustering node embeddings and merging connected components within the same cluster. The paper claims HELP achieves on-par accuracy with standard GCNs and other pooling methods while providing more understandable explanations, validated through concept completeness and a new metric called concept conformity. The method is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The hierarchical, interpretable-by-design approach to graph pooling is a significant contribution. The idea of composing concepts from different GNN layers is well-motivated and addresses a key limitation of existing concept-based GNN explanation methods.
*   **Interpretability Focus:** The paper explicitly targets interpretability as a primary goal, which is crucial for deploying GNNs in high-stakes decision-making settings.
*   **Concept Conformity Metric:** The proposed concept conformity metric is a valuable addition to the existing evaluation toolkit for interpretable GNNs, offering a more nuanced measure of concept quality than purity alone.  The motivation for considering multiple frequent subgraphs as a valid concept is sound.
*   **Expressiveness:** The paper clearly demonstrates that HELP is more expressive than 1-WL, a significant advantage over many message-passing GNNs.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The paper provides a comprehensive set of experiments on multiple datasets, including a novel synthetic hierarchical dataset.  Ablation studies are also included, lending credibility to the design choices.
*   **Qualitative Analysis:**  The qualitative analysis and alignment of discovered concepts with domain expert knowledge is a strong point, highlighting the practical utility of HELP's explanations.
*   **Reproducibility:**  The authors have taken steps to ensure reproducibility by providing hyperparameters, code in the repository, and detailed instructions for recreating the visualizations.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clustering Sensitivity:** While the authors claim robustness to the number of clusters, the choice of `k-means` as the clustering algorithm raises concerns about its sensitivity to initialization and the inherent assumption of spherical clusters. A discussion of potential alternatives (e.g., GMMs, spectral clustering) and their tradeoffs would be beneficial.
*   **Global Clustering Memory Requirements:** The authors acknowledge the memory limitations of the global clustering approach. It would be useful to quantify these requirements more precisely, perhaps with a scaling analysis in the appendix.  This limits the applicability of that variant.
*   **Hyperplane Gradient Approximation Complexity:** The complexity and computational cost of the hyperplane gradient approximation are significant limitations. The ablation study shows it performs comparably to the simpler gradient flow approach, making its practical value questionable.  More in-depth hyperparameter tuning might be needed, but the computational burden is a barrier.
*   **Conformity Metric Limitations:** The conformity metric relies on a threshold `t`, which introduces a hyperparameter. While the authors choose a default value, a sensitivity analysis of the metric's behavior with respect to `t` would be helpful. Also, while graph isomorphism is acknowledged as an issue, relying on WL hashes might lead to collisions and inaccurate conformity scores. The impact of these collisions should be discussed. The metric is infeasible for larger datasets, limiting its widespread use.
*   **Clarity in Gradient Flow Explanation:** The explanation of gradient flow and the motivation for the hyperplane gradient approximation could be clarified further.  Figure 5 is helpful but dense, and the text is somewhat difficult to follow.
*   **Missing ASAP Results on REDDIT:** The lack of ASAP results on REDDIT-BINARY due to memory constraints is unfortunate. It weakens the comparative analysis.
*   **Related Work Discussion:** Although the related work section is detailed, it could benefit from a more critical discussion of the limitations of competing approaches beyond what is already presented. For example, a more in-depth contrast with other explainable GNNs in terms of computational overhead would be helpful.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Clustering:** Explore and discuss alternative clustering algorithms to `k-means`, addressing its limitations and justifying the final choice more thoroughly.
*   **Memory Footprint:** Provide a more detailed analysis of the memory requirements for global clustering.
*   **Hyperplane Gradient Approximation:**  Since the results are similar without this, consider moving the detail to the appendix to save space.
*   **Conformity Threshold Sensitivity:** Conduct a sensitivity analysis of the concept conformity metric with respect to the threshold parameter `t`. Acknowledge the limitations of the WL hash approach in the conformity metric.
*   **Gradient Flow Clarity:** Revise the explanation of gradient flow and hyperplane gradient approximation for improved clarity. Potentially simplify Figure 5.
*   **Related Work:** Strengthen the related work section by including a more critical discussion of the limitations of existing approaches. Compare computational costs where possible.
*   **Broader Impact:** While the paper focuses on positive aspects of interpretability, adding a section on potential negative societal impacts (e.g., biases in explanations) could improve the paper's completeness.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of interpretable GNNs. The HELP method offers a novel and promising approach to hierarchical graph pooling that yields more understandable explanations. Despite some weaknesses, the paper is well-written, the experiments are thorough, and the results are compelling. The paper is likely to be of interest to the ICLR community. I recommend acceptance, pending minor revisions to address the points mentioned above.
