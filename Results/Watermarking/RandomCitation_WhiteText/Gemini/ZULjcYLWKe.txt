OUTPUT:
Following Stokes et al. (2019), this paper presents DMBP, a Diffusion Model-Based Predictor, designed to enhance the robustness of offline reinforcement learning (RL) agents against state observation perturbations. The core idea is to use a conditional diffusion model to denoise perturbed state observations before feeding them to an existing offline RL algorithm. A key contribution is a proposed non-Markovian training objective for the diffusion model, aiming to mitigate error accumulation during the denoising process in RL trajectories. The paper also explores the use of DMBP for state infilling in scenarios with incomplete state observations. Extensive experiments on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that DMBP significantly improves the robustness of various offline RL algorithms against different types and scales of noise and adversarial attacks, as well as handling incomplete observations.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The use of diffusion models as a *denoising* tool in offline RL, rather than as trajectory generators or behavior cloners, is a fresh perspective and addresses a critical challenge in real-world RL applications. The paper clearly distinguishes DMBP from existing diffusion-based RL methods.
*   **Problem Relevance:** Robustness against state observation perturbations is a crucial aspect of deploying offline RL agents in real-world scenarios, where sensor errors, adversarial attacks, and domain shifts are common. The paper effectively highlights this challenge in the introduction.
*   **Technical Contribution:** The non-Markovian loss function is a well-motivated and potentially significant contribution. It directly addresses the issue of error accumulation, a common problem in model-based RL. The derivation of the simplified loss function (Eq. 7) is detailed in the appendix, which aids in reproducibility.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The extensive experimental results on D4RL benchmarks provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of DMBP. The comparisons against various baseline algorithms, under different types of noise and adversarial attacks, demonstrate the broad applicability of the proposed method. The inclusion of results for incomplete state observations further strengthens the practical relevance of the work. The ablation studies on M, N and Network structure provide insight in the design choices.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, with a clear explanation of the DMBP framework and the proposed training objective. The inclusion of diagrams (Figure 1 and 5) helps to visualize the approach. The GitHub link increases transparency and reproducibility.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The paper mentions the variance schedule (a, b, c) as a hyperparameter, and tuning N, M and the embedded dimension $\zeta$ for different tasks. This raises concerns about the practical applicability of DMBP, as it may require significant effort to tune these parameters for new environments. A more in-depth discussion of hyperparameter sensitivity and guidelines for selecting appropriate values would be beneficial.
*   **Computational Cost:** While the paper includes a discussion of computational cost, the runtime analysis suggests a significant increase in decision time when using DMBP. While the authors suggest ways to mitigate the computational cost, this weakness needs to be addressed.
*   **Limited Generalization Analysis:** While the authors have shown strong performance on the D4RL benchmark, further analysis of DMBP's generalization capabilities would be beneficial. Specifically, assessing its performance when trained and tested on datasets with different characteristics (e.g., different behavior policies) could provide valuable insights.
*   **Lack of comparison to other robust offline RL methods:** While RORL is used as a baseline algorithm, it would help to include other methods for robust offline RL in the comparison.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Provide more detailed guidelines for selecting appropriate hyperparameters for DMBP. Explore techniques for automating hyperparameter optimization.
*   **Implicit sampling:** Include the comparison of decision time consumption using implicit sampling techniques.
*   **Generalization Analysis:** Conduct experiments to assess the generalization performance of DMBP across different datasets.
*   **Normalization Considerations:** Add a section validating DMBP with normalized state observations.
*   **Computational Cost Mitigation:** Discuss methods to further reduce the computational cost of DMBP, such as techniques for reducing the number of diffusion steps or simplifying the network architecture.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a novel and effective approach for enhancing the robustness of offline RL agents against state observation perturbations. The proposed DMBP framework, with its non-Markovian training objective, shows promising results on D4RL benchmarks. While there are some areas for improvement, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of offline RL and is well-suited for presentation at ICLR.
