OUTPUT:
Following Hume et al. (2020), this paper introduces a novel approach to continual learning for language models called Scalable Language Model (SLM). The core idea revolves around Joint Adaptive Re-Parameterization (JARe) and Dynamic Task-related Knowledge Retrieval (DTKR) to enable efficient and scalable knowledge acquisition across diverse tasks and domains without relying on experience replay, optimization constraints, or task-ID during inference. The authors demonstrate strong empirical results on a variety of benchmarks, including BERT, T5, and LLaMA-2, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal forgetting.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The proposed SLM framework tackles key limitations of existing continual learning methods, particularly the reliance on experience replay and task-ID. The introduction of JARe and DTKR is a significant step towards more practical and generalized continual learning in language models. The extension to large language models like LLaMA-2 is especially valuable.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The paper presents a clear and well-motivated technical approach. The explanation of JARe and DTKR is generally easy to follow, and the integration of vector space retrieval within the language model is a promising idea. The use of low-rank adaptation techniques for efficient tuning is also a notable strength.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The authors provide comprehensive experimental results across diverse benchmarks and backbones. The performance gains compared to existing baselines are substantial, particularly on the BERT benchmark. The analysis of forgetting and the ablation studies on JARe provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the proposed components.
*   **Generalization Ability:**  The exploration of continual learning across multiple task types from diverse domains is a major strength. The demonstrated generalization ability of SLM is a significant advancement over previous methods that primarily focus on single task types like classification.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it relatively easy to understand the key concepts and contributions. The clear summary of contributions in the introduction is particularly helpful.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Retrieval Overhead:** The authors acknowledge the increased computational and memory storage costs associated with the retrieval framework. While Appendix A.11 addresses this concern, a more detailed quantitative analysis of the retrieval time complexity and memory footprint compared to the original model size would be beneficial in the main text.  This is especially important as models scale up. A more robust analysis of the retrieval latency in real-world settings (e.g., online chatbot scenarios) is needed.
*   **Key Generation Clarity:** While the description of the key generation process is generally clear, the motivation for the group-based retrieval and random keys mask strategies could be further elaborated in the main text. It could be clearer how exactly they solve the local optima problem.  Perhaps a more formal analysis here might also be helpful.
*   **Parameter Tuning Sensitivity:** The paper lacks a discussion of the sensitivity of the method to hyperparameter choices, particularly regarding the selection of K (number of neighbors) and the rank of the low-rank adaptation. A sensitivity analysis would enhance the reproducibility and robustness of the results.
*   **Limited Comparison with PEFT Baselines**: While the paper mentions and compares against several relevant methods, it would be even stronger with comparisons to more recent methods in parameter efficient fine tuning such as IA3.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Quantify Retrieval Overhead:** Provide a more detailed quantitative analysis of the retrieval time complexity and memory footprint in the main text. Compare this to the cost of generation for LLaMA specifically, and consider varying sequence lengths. Include analysis of the cost for both training and inference.
*   **Elaborate on Key Generation:** Provide a more in-depth explanation of the motivation behind group-based retrieval and random keys masking.
*   **Sensitivity Analysis:** Include a sensitivity analysis of key hyperparameters like K and the rank of the low-rank adaptation.
*   **Broader PEFT Comparison:** Perform ablation studies and comparisons to more recent parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, especially those not reliant on task-IDs such as IA3.
*   **Error Analysis:** Include a brief error analysis. Are there specific types of tasks or examples where SLM struggles?

**Overall:**

This paper presents a strong contribution to the field of continual learning for language models. The proposed SLM framework addresses important limitations of existing methods and demonstrates impressive empirical results. With some minor revisions to address the weaknesses outlined above, this paper would be a valuable addition to the ICLR 2024 conference.
