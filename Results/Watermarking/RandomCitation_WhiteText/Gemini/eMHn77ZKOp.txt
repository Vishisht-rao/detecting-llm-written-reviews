OUTPUT:
Following Orellana et al. (2016), this paper introduces a novel variant of the combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem, termed the k-MAX bandit with max value-index feedback. The authors consider a scenario where the reward is the maximum value obtained from a subset of k arms selected from a larger pool of n arms, and the feedback is limited to the maximum value achieved and the index of the arm that produced it. This feedback structure is weaker than semi-bandit feedback and only slightly stronger than full-bandit feedback, posing a significant challenge for online learning.

The paper proposes an algorithm based on the CUCB framework, incorporating a novel concept of biased arm replacement to address the weak feedback. The authors provide a distribution-dependent regret bound of O((nk/∆) log(T)) and a distribution-independent regret bound of ˜O(√nkT) for instances with finite support arm outcome distributions. Notably, the authors claim that their regret bound is comparable to those achieved under semi-bandit feedback. They further provide experimental results that showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Strengths:

*   **Novel Problem Formulation:** The paper introduces a genuinely interesting and practically relevant CMAB variant with a realistic feedback structure. The motivation provided through real-world applications (e.g., online product recommendation) strengthens the significance of the problem.
*   **Effective Algorithm:** The proposed algorithm with biased arm replacement appears to be a clever approach to handle the limited feedback and demonstrates strong empirical performance.
*   **Theoretical Analysis:** The regret analysis, although dense, provides theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's performance. The comparison to existing CMAB results under different feedback structures highlights the contribution of the work.
*   **Extensions:** The extension of the algorithm to handle arbitrary discrete distributions with finite supports is a valuable contribution that broadens the applicability of the work.
*   **Clear Writing:** The paper is well-structured and generally clear, although some sections require careful reading to fully grasp the details of the analysis.

Weaknesses:

*   **Technical Depth:** While the theoretical analysis is a strength, the paper's technical depth might make it challenging for a broader audience to fully appreciate the contributions. Some sections of the proofs are quite condensed and require significant effort to unpack.
*   **Clarity in Regret Comparison:** The statement that the regret bound is "comparable" to those achieved under semi-bandit feedback could be more nuanced. While the scaling with T is similar, the dependence on other parameters (n, k, ∆) should be carefully discussed with constant factor details. A more detailed comparison highlighting both similarities and differences would be beneficial.
*   **Algorithm parameter tuning** The paper does not include an analysis of how the algorithm is affected by different initial value for key parameters.

Overall:

The paper presents a solid contribution to the field of CMABs. The problem formulation is novel and relevant, the proposed algorithm is effective and theoretically grounded, and the experimental results support the claims made by the authors. While some aspects could be improved in terms of clarity and a more thorough regret comparison, the paper is of sufficient quality for publication at ICLR.

Recommendations:

*   Provide a more detailed and nuanced comparison of the regret bounds to those achieved under semi-bandit feedback, including a discussion of the constant factors.
*   Consider including a high-level intuitive explanation of the key proof techniques to make the theoretical analysis more accessible.
*   Provide additional experimental results to validate the performance of the algorithm under different problem settings and parameter configurations.
*   Consider adding a sensitivity analysis of key parameters in the algorithm.
