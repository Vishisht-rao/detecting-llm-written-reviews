OUTPUT:
Following Shade et al. (2018), this paper proposes a novel framework for comparing NLP models by evaluating their shared invariance to interpretable input perturbations targeting specific linguistic capabilities. The core idea is to generate perturbations that leave a reference model's behavior unchanged and then measure how the target model responds to these perturbations. The authors introduce two new metrics, Hard-SCoPE and Soft-SCoPE, to quantify the degree of shared invariance. Through experiments on text classification and language modeling tasks, the paper offers insights into how model design choices (distillation, size, pre-training) affect these shared invariances and also demonstrates how the framework can compare black-box APIs with more transparent models.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The framework is novel and provides a fresh perspective on model comparison that goes beyond traditional benchmark accuracy. The focus on shared invariances is a valuable addition to the field.
*   **Clarity:** The problem is well-defined, and the methodology is clearly explained. The descriptions of Hard-SCoPE and Soft-SCoPE are comprehensive, and the motivations behind their design are well-articulated.
*   **Empirical Evaluation:** The paper presents a thorough empirical evaluation with a variety of models, tasks, and linguistic capabilities. The experiments are well-designed and provide meaningful insights.
*   **Insights:** The paper uncovers interesting insights about the effect of distillation, model size, and pre-training on shared invariances.  The observations about large language models sharing invariances more broadly, and the differences between RL-finetuned models and supervised finetuned models, are particularly noteworthy.
*   **Relevance:** Model comparison is a crucial challenge in NLP. The proposed framework addresses this challenge in a principled and insightful way, providing tools for better understanding and evaluation.
*   **Well Written:** The paper is generally well-written and organized.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Efficiency of Perturbation Generation:** The paper acknowledges the inefficiency of the search methods used for perturbation generation, especially when applied to black-box APIs. This is a significant limitation, as it limits the scalability and applicability of the framework. While mentioned as a limitation in the conclusion, the impact on practical application should be emphasized more clearly within the results discussion.
*   **Choice of Linguistic Capabilities:** While the paper experiments with three linguistic capabilities, it could benefit from a more comprehensive exploration of different capabilities. It is mentioned that capabilities can be expanded by defining transformations and constraints, the selection of the initial three could benefit from more detailed justification. The discussion around the fairness metric relies upon a specific dataset, and while this is adequately justified, the limitations of this decision in the broader scope could be more clearly outlined.
*   **Interpretability of SCoPE metrics:** While the paper motivates and defines Soft- and Hard-SCoPE, the absolute values of the metrics, and their difference, are sometimes difficult to interpret. The paper provides good intuition, but could benefit from more visualization or further examples that show the practical significance of the different SCoPE measures in varying scenarios. Specifically, what does a Soft-SCoPE of 0.6 *mean* for a practitioner?
*   **Limited Correlation Analysis:** While the paper presents a correlation analysis between the proposed invariance-based measures and existing metrics, it's relatively sparse. A more comprehensive analysis with a wider range of metrics and models could provide a stronger validation of the novel contributions.
*   **Appendix Overload:** Some content in the appendix is central enough to the arguments of the paper that it should arguably be moved into the main body. The additional results from the AG-news dataset are an example of this.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address the efficiency issue:** The authors should prioritize developing more efficient search methods for perturbation generation, potentially exploring gradient-based approaches or other optimization techniques. Provide a clearer roadmap for tackling this challenge in future work.
*   **Expand the range of linguistic capabilities:** Explore a wider range of linguistic capabilities, potentially drawing inspiration from resources like CheckList. This would demonstrate the versatility of the framework.
*   **Elaborate on the interpretation of SCoPE metrics:** Provide more detailed guidance on how to interpret the values of Hard-SCoPE and Soft-SCoPE in practical settings. Use additional case studies or visualizations to illustrate their significance.
*   **Strengthen the correlation analysis:** Conduct a more comprehensive correlation analysis with a wider range of existing metrics and models. This would provide stronger evidence of the added value of the proposed invariance-based measures.
*   **Refactor content between main paper and appendix:** Promote some content from the appendix into the main body of the paper.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper with a novel and insightful framework for comparing NLP models. The empirical evaluation is thorough, and the results offer valuable insights. Addressing the limitations related to efficiency and broadening the evaluation scope would further strengthen the paper. I recommend acceptance, conditional on addressing the suggestions above.
