OUTPUT:
Following Williams et al. (2019), this paper tackles an important and timely problem: class unlearning in the context of imbalanced data with restricted data access. This scenario is highly relevant to real-world applications where data privacy and storage limitations are paramount. The paper proposes GENIU, a novel framework leveraging a VAE to generate proxies and an in-batch tuning strategy to address the challenges posed by imbalanced datasets.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Relevance:** The paper addresses a critical gap in the existing literature, which primarily focuses on balanced datasets and full data access scenarios. The imbalanced data setting is much more realistic and poses significant challenges for unlearning methods.
*   **Novel Approach:** GENIU offers a creative solution by training a proxy generator concurrently with the original model. This allows the generator to capture accurate class representations even in the presence of imbalance, mitigating the biases introduced by existing methods. The "in-batch tuning" is also a sensible strategy to further improve unlearning by incorporating impairment and repair as a unified objective, instead of distinct steps.
*   **Strong Empirical Evaluation:** The paper presents thorough experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets (Digits-MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, CIFAR-10). The results demonstrate the superiority of GENIU over existing baselines, including I-R, Unrolling SGD, GKT, and UNSIR, in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The analysis on the time cost in the unlearning phase and the storage cost is helpful to evaluate the practical values of the proposed approach.
*   **Clear and Well-Structured:** The paper is well-written and organized, with a clear introduction of the problem, related work, proposed method, and experimental results. The figures and tables are informative and contribute to the overall understanding of the paper.
*   **Comprehensive Ablation Studies:** The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the contribution of different components of GENIU, highlighting the importance of concurrent training and in-batch tuning. The additional investigations on supervision sample selection and the number of in-batch tuning rounds further strengthen the analysis.
*   **Addressing a Specific Failure Mode:** The paper identifies and addresses a key failure mode of existing generative-based unlearning methods in the imbalanced setting: proxies inheriting characteristics of the majority class. The KL divergence analysis to measure model's bias towards majority class and experiments with GKT's noise using GENIU's VAE are solid support for the contributions of the proposed framework.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity on Noise Initialization:** The description of the noise initialization and training process (Section 4.2) could be slightly clearer. While the optimization objective is mentioned, providing more details on how the noise samples are updated iteratively would be helpful. For example, what is the learning rate, batch size used to train the noise?
*   **Generator Architecture Details:** While the paper mentions the CNN structure of the encoder and decoder, providing more specific details on the number of layers, filter sizes, and activation functions used would be beneficial for reproducibility.
*   **Computational cost during training**: Although the paper addresses computational cost in the unlearning phase, it would be good to provide more discussion on the additional computational overhead during training due to the joint training of the proxy generator and the main classifier.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis:** A discussion of the sensitivity of GENIU's performance to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the trade-off parameter Î» in the generator loss and the learning rate for in-batch tuning, would be valuable.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   Add more details on noise initialization and training process (Section 4.2).
*   Provide more specific details on the generator architecture.
*   Include a discussion on computational overhead during training and potential optimizations.
*   Discuss the sensitivity of GENIU's performance to hyperparameter settings.

**Overall:**

This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of machine unlearning by addressing the challenges of imbalanced data and restricted data access. The proposed GENIU framework is innovative, well-evaluated, and offers a practical solution for class unlearning in real-world scenarios. The paper is of high quality and is suitable for publication at ICLR 2024, pending minor revisions to address the points mentioned above.
