OUTPUT:
Following Ivory et al. (2014), this paper presents a compelling investigation into the challenges of applying persistent homology to high-dimensional data, particularly in the presence of noise. The authors identify a key limitation of vanilla persistent homology, where noise dominates the signal, obscuring true topological features. They propose using spectral distances on k-nearest-neighbor graphs, such as diffusion distance and effective resistance, as a robust alternative.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Definition:** The paper clearly articulates a significant problem in topological data analysis: the sensitivity of persistent homology to noise in high-dimensional spaces. The toy example of a noisy circle in R50 effectively demonstrates this issue.
*   **Novelty:** The application of spectral distances, particularly effective resistance, to persistent homology for high-dimensional data is novel. The derivation of a closed-form expression for effective resistance in terms of the eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian is a significant contribution.
*   **Methodology:** The paper presents a well-defined synthetic benchmark to evaluate different distance metrics for persistent homology. The use of a "hole detection score" provides a quantitative measure of performance.
*   **Empirical Results:** The paper provides strong empirical evidence that spectral distances outperform existing methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The application to single-cell RNA-sequencing data is particularly compelling.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, although some sections could benefit from further clarification (see weaknesses). The figures are helpful in illustrating the key concepts.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Related Work:** While the related work section covers several relevant methods, a more in-depth comparison with other dimensionality reduction techniques and their limitations could further strengthen the paper. Specifically, a discussion on how the proposed method compares to applying persistent homology *after* dimensionality reduction would be valuable.
*   **Theoretical Justification:** While the empirical results are strong, a more rigorous theoretical justification for why spectral distances are more robust to noise in high-dimensional spaces would be beneficial. Some intuition is provided, but a more formal analysis would strengthen the paper's contribution.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The paper acknowledges the importance of hyperparameter tuning, but a more detailed analysis of the sensitivity of the results to different hyperparameter choices could be included. While the Appendix mentions the selected hyperparameters, providing guidance on how to choose these parameters in practice would be helpful.
*   **Computational Complexity:** The paper acknowledges the computational complexity of persistent homology, but a more detailed discussion of the scalability of the proposed method would be valuable. Are there specific optimizations that can be employed to improve performance on large datasets?
*   **Figure 2:** While the figure tries to be helpful, the label "Score=p1/p2" is confusing and possibly incorrect, as the detection score is later defined as a *difference* divided by persistence.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   Expand the discussion of related work to include a more thorough comparison with other dimensionality reduction techniques and methods for applying persistent homology to graph data.
*   Provide a more rigorous theoretical justification for the robustness of spectral distances to noise.
*   Include a more detailed analysis of the sensitivity of the results to hyperparameter choices. Offer practical guidance on selecting appropriate hyperparameter values.
*   Discuss the scalability of the proposed method and potential optimizations for large datasets.
*   Correct potentially wrong formula in Figure 2.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that addresses an important problem in topological data analysis. The proposed method is novel and well-supported by empirical evidence. The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field. I recommend acceptance, conditional on addressing the weaknesses and suggestions outlined above.
