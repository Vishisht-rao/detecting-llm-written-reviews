OUTPUT:
Following Bolinger et al. (2023), this paper explores the Generalized Gaussian (GG) mechanism as a potential alternative to the Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms, commonly used in differentially private (DP) machine learning. The authors prove that all members of the GG family satisfy DP, provide an extension to the PRV accountant for privacy accounting, and apply the GG mechanism to PATE and DP-SGD. Their empirical results suggest that the choice of the GG parameter β has a relatively weak relationship with test accuracy, and that Gaussian noise (β=2) is often near-optimal. However, they also observe minor improvements in utility for β ≠ 2, suggesting further exploration of general families of noise distributions.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The paper explores a relatively unexplored area in DP, the use of the Generalized Gaussian mechanism. While not entirely new (Liu, 2019), the paper provides a more comprehensive analysis, particularly with the PRV accountant.
*   **Theoretical Contributions:** The paper formally proves that the GG mechanism satisfies DP. The extension of the PRV accountant to handle the GG mechanism is a valuable contribution.
*   **Empirical Evaluation:** The paper provides a thorough empirical evaluation on two canonical DP learning tasks, PATE and DP-SGD, using several datasets and models.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is well-written and generally easy to follow. The introduction clearly outlines the problem, the proposed solution, and the contributions of the work.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors provide a code repository, which enhances reproducibility.
*   **Dimension independence analysis:** Proving the dimension independence when using ℓβ sensitivity is a neat theoretical result.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Utility Gains:** While the paper suggests potential improvements for β ≠ 2, the observed gains in utility are relatively minor. The practical significance of these improvements may be limited.
*   **Justification for Parameter Choices:** In the DP-SGD experiments, the choice of using the ℓβ norm for clipping rather than a fixed choice like ℓ2 needs stronger justification. While the authors mention dimension independence in Appendix B.2, it is not entirely clear why this is the preferred approach. The impact of this choice on the observed results should be further discussed.
*   **Limited Comparison to other DP Mechanisms:** While the paper does cover some other DP mechanisms in the related works, a stronger comparative analysis, even empirically, against mechanisms like the Staircase or Podium mechanism, particularly in low-composition settings, would be helpful.
*   **Overclaiming "SOTA":** The paper claims to slightly surpass SOTA results in one case (CIFAR-10). However, the difference appears marginal, and it is partly attributed to using the PRV accountant (which provides tighter privacy guarantees compared to RDP). It is important to acknowledge that the improvement is not solely due to the GG mechanism. The cost of hyperparameter search with the GG mechanism should also be considered, as mentioned by Papernot & Steinke (2022).
*   **Lack of Theoretical Justification for Empirical Findings:** The observation that β ≈ 2 (Gaussian) performs near-optimally is primarily based on empirical evidence. While the paper offers some intuition, a more rigorous theoretical explanation would strengthen the findings. The exploration of outlier minimization as a potential design principle needs further development.
*   **Minor inconsistencies:** The document mentions "proof C.2" multiple times, but it seems to refer to Appendix C.2 as the proof for Theorem 3.1. It would be cleaner to explicitly state "Appendix C.2" instead.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Quantify the Impact of ℓβ Clipping:** Provide a more detailed analysis of the impact of using ℓβ clipping versus a fixed clipping norm (e.g., ℓ2) in DP-SGD. Explore how this choice affects the privacy-utility trade-off for different values of β.
*   **Explore Alternative Utility Metrics:** Consider exploring alternative utility metrics beyond test accuracy, such as calibration error or fairness metrics, to assess the impact of the GG mechanism on different aspects of model performance.
*   **Theoretical Analysis of β ≈ 2:** Attempt to provide a more theoretical explanation for why β ≈ 2 performs near-optimally. This could involve analyzing the properties of the Generalized Gaussian distribution and its relationship to the optimization landscape in DP-SGD.
*   **Discuss Limitations of PRV Accountant:** Acknowledge the limitations of the PRV accountant, such as its computational cost and dependence on numerical approximations.
*   **Further Exploration of β Selection:** While the authors mention hyperparameter search for β, they could explore more sophisticated methods, perhaps borrowing from meta-learning techniques to intelligently choose β based on dataset characteristics.
*   **Clear Up Inconsistencies:** Fix minor inconsistencies in references to the appendix (e.g., explicitly state "Appendix C.2" instead of "proof C.2").

**Overall:**

The paper presents a valuable exploration of the Generalized Gaussian mechanism for differentially private machine learning. The theoretical contributions, empirical evaluations, and the extension to the PRV accountant are significant. While the observed utility gains are modest, the paper provides a solid foundation for future research in this area. The suggestions for improvement outlined above could further strengthen the paper and enhance its impact.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the weaknesses and suggestions outlined above. The work is a valuable contribution to the field of differential privacy and warrants publication at ICLR.
