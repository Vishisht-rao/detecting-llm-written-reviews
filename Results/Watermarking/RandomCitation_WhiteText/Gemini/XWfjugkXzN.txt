OUTPUT:
Following Privett et al. (2022), this paper tackles an important and practical problem in the field of imperfect-information games: how to efficiently learn value functions (or evaluators) for information sets by sampling a subset of states within those sets. The core question the paper addresses – how many states should be sampled from a given information set to balance computational cost and accuracy – is well-motivated and relevant to a wide range of applications, from card games like Poker to board games like Reconnaissance Blind Chess. The paper is clearly written and the experiments are designed to provide insights into this fundamental trade-off.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Formulation:** The formalization of the problem in Section 2 is well-defined and clearly explains the challenges associated with learning in imperfect information settings. The connection to noisy labels and active learning is also relevant.
*   **Experimental Setup:** The use of three different experimental settings (MNIST with uncertainty, Heads-Up Poker, and Reconnaissance Blind Chess) allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach in diverse scenarios. The description of each setup is detailed enough to understand the methodology.
*   **Results and Analysis:** The paper presents a thorough analysis of the experimental results, highlighting the trade-offs between the number of samples, label quality, and computational cost. The visualizations (especially Figures 1, 4, and 6) are effective in illustrating the key findings. The authors also acknowledge the limitations of their approach and offer reasonable explanations for the observed discrepancies between the MNIST results and the poker/RBC results.
*   **Relevance and Impact:** The research is highly relevant to the Game AI community and offers practical insights into optimizing the sampling of information sets in imperfect-information games. The conclusions drawn from the experiments can guide the design of more efficient and effective learning algorithms for these types of games.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors claim that the source code will be made public upon acceptance, which significantly enhances the reproducibility of the results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Novelty:** While the problem itself is important, the approach is relatively straightforward. The core idea of sampling to approximate the expected value is not entirely novel, although its application to learning value functions for imperfect information games is valuable. The connection to the law of large numbers could be made more explicit.
*   **Lack of Comparison to Existing Techniques:** The paper mentions several related works in Section 3, but it does not provide a direct comparison of the proposed approach to these existing techniques. It would be beneficial to benchmark the performance of the sampling-based learning method against other commonly used approaches for evaluating information sets, such as Perfect Information Monte Carlo or Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search. This would provide a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach in comparison to the state-of-the-art.
*   **Limited Discussion of Distributional Assumptions:** The paper acknowledges that the assumption of a uniform distribution of states within an information set may not hold in practice (Section 6). However, the impact of different distributional assumptions on the optimal sampling strategy is not explored in detail. It would be interesting to investigate how the sampling strategy should be adapted when prior knowledge about the distribution of states within the information set is available.
*   **Clarity on the Neural Network Architecture and Training Details:** More details could be provided about the architectures of the neural networks used in the experiments and the specific training parameters. While the paper mentions "basic convolutional neural network" in the MNIST section, providing more specifics about layers, activation functions, and optimizers would enhance the clarity. Similarly, in other experiments, the network architecture should be clearly described.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Comparison to Baselines:** Include a comparison to at least one existing method for evaluating information sets (e.g., Perfect Information Monte Carlo) in the experimental evaluation.
*   **Discussion of Non-Uniform Distributions:** Elaborate on the potential impact of non-uniform distributions on the sampling strategy and suggest possible approaches for addressing this issue.
*   **Provide more details on Network Architectures:** In the experiment section, please describe the network architectures clearly.
*   **Broader Literature Review:** While the related works section is adequate, it could be expanded to include more recent advances in imperfect information game solving and learning.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of imperfect-information games by investigating the trade-offs associated with sampling states from information sets to learn value functions. The experiments are well-designed and the results provide practical insights into optimizing the sampling strategy. While the approach is relatively straightforward, the problem is important and the paper offers a solid foundation for future research in this area. With the suggested improvements, the paper can be further strengthened and its impact increased.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend this paper for acceptance with minor revisions. The weaknesses are primarily related to a lack of comparison to existing techniques and limited discussion of distributional assumptions, which can be addressed through revisions.
