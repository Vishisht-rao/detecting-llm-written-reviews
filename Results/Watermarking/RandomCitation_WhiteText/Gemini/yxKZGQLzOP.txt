OUTPUT:
Following Yousif et al. (2023), this paper tackles the challenging problem of scaling program synthesis from examples (PBE) to realistic program spaces. The key idea is to leverage the Rational Speech Acts (RSA) framework to generate informative training examples for neural program synthesizers. The paper proposes PRAX, a novel self-play algorithm where listener (synthesizer) and speaker (example generator) models iteratively improve each other by generating pragmatic examples and training on them.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The approach of using self-play and pragmatic inference to generate training data for neural program synthesizers is novel and addresses a key limitation of prior work on RSA-based program synthesis, namely scalability.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The paper demonstrates significant improvements over a literal baseline (51% relative increase) and matches the performance of supervised learning on human-provided pragmatic examples without using any human data in training. The human evaluation further validates the effectiveness of the generated informative examples.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is well-written and explains the method clearly, with helpful figures and pseudocode. The background section provides a good overview of related work.
*   **Thorough Experimental Setup:** The experiments are well-designed, with comparisons to strong baselines, including a model fine-tuned on human-provided data and GPT-3.5. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the training process and ablations.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors have made their code and data publicly available, which promotes reproducibility and further research.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Domain Specificity:** The evaluation is limited to the domain of regular expression synthesis. While this is a well-studied PBE task, it is not clear how well the approach would generalize to other, more complex programming domains. The regular expression DSL used is also fairly constrained.
*   **Computational Cost:** While PRAX avoids the expensive counterfactual inference of traditional RSA at runtime, the iterative training process can still be computationally intensive, as evidenced by the need to sample from both base and round-specific models, and to train for 20 rounds. It would be helpful to have a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of PRAX.
*   **Model Selection:** The model selection process relies on a small validation set of human-provided examples. While the authors claim this is only used for model selection and not for training, it still introduces a potential dependence on human data.
*   **GPT-3.5 Evaluation:** The GPT-3.5 evaluation, while interesting, seems somewhat rudimentary. A more interactive setup where the model observes the user's intention through iterative feedback could yield more meaningful results.
*   **Lack of Comparison to SOTA Neural Program Synthesis:** While the paper compares well against baselines and human-annotated data, it could benefit from a comparison against current state-of-the-art neural program synthesis approaches for regular expression generation, even if they don't explicitly model pragmatics. This would provide a clearer picture of the overall performance of PRAX.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   Evaluate the approach on a broader range of PBE tasks and programming domains to assess its generalizability.
*   Provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of PRAX and explore ways to reduce it.
*   Investigate alternative model selection strategies that do not rely on human-provided data.
*   Conduct a more sophisticated evaluation of LLMs like GPT-3.5, allowing for iterative feedback and adaptation.
*   Compare the performance of PRAX to state-of-the-art neural program synthesis approaches for regular expression generation.
*   Consider exploring different architectures for the speaker and listener models.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach to scaling pragmatic program synthesis. The empirical results are impressive, and the paper is well-written and clearly presented. While there are some limitations, the contributions of this work are significant and warrant publication. The paper has the potential to make a significant impact on the field of program synthesis. I would recommend acceptance.
