OUTPUT:
Following Henriquez et al. (2023), this paper presents VarNMF, a probabilistic extension of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) designed to model variation in source signals between samples. Unlike traditional NMF, which assumes constant source components, VarNMF models each source as a distribution (specifically, a Gamma distribution) and learns the parameters of these distributions from mixed samples using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) procedure. The paper demonstrates the model's ability to extract cancer-associated source distributions from liquid biopsies, reflecting inter-cancer variability without prior knowledge.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The core idea of modeling source variation directly within the NMF framework is a valuable contribution. Addressing limitations of standard NMF and Bayesian extensions by accounting for sample-specific source signal is significant.
*   **Probabilistic Framework:**  The probabilistic formulation allows for principled inference and estimation of sample-specific source contributions via the posterior. This is a powerful feature.
*   **Application and Motivation:** The motivation from genomic data (cfChIP-seq) provides a compelling use case, and the explanation of the data's characteristics is clear. The need to disentangle variation due to mixing proportions from true source variation is well-articulated.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The synthetic data experiments are well-designed to evaluate the model's ability to recover source distributions under varying degrees of source variation. The comparison with NMF and K-NMF provides strong evidence for the benefits of VarNMF. The application to real cfChIP-seq data offers further support, showcasing the model's ability to explain unexplained signal and identify patient-specific disease behavior.
*   **Reproducibility:** The inclusion of a reproducibility statement and the availability of code and data are commendable.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, particularly in the initial sections. The figures are helpful in illustrating the concepts.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Complexity of the EM procedure:** While the paper acknowledges the computational burden of the EM procedure, the details provided are extensive and may be difficult for readers unfamiliar with EM or NMF to follow. Further clarification or simplification of this section would improve accessibility.
*   **Justification of Gamma Distribution:** The choice of the Gamma distribution is mentioned as a "common modeling choice" but a more thorough justification for its suitability in this specific application would be beneficial. While common in gene expression, exploring alternative distributions and discussing their potential advantages/disadvantages could strengthen the work.
*   **Practical Scalability:** While the alternating EM alleviates some computational issues, scalability to even larger datasets or with more components (K) remains a concern. Further discussion on techniques for scaling the model to high-dimensional data would be helpful.
*   **Identifiability Issues:** While acknowledged, the identifiability issue requires a more robust discussion. The paper mentions normalization schemes to alleviate ambiguity but a deeper analysis of the potential impact of non-uniqueness on the biological interpretation of the components should be included. What are the implications of potential local minima? Is there a way to check the stability of the solutions?
*   **Comparison to Other Methods:** The comparison to Andrade Barbosa et al. (2021) focuses on the lack of direct source observations. While this is a key difference, a more thorough comparison of the model's performance and limitations against other related probabilistic models would be valuable.
*   **Lack of statistical significance test:** in figure 4, although the paper mention a significance value, this value seems to be based on the individual gene and does not involve group difference or sample variations.
*    **Uniqueness of the solution:** It is mentioned that EM assures convergence to a local maximum. how robust is the proposed solutions? is there a method to test the stability of the solutions?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Simplify the EM details:**  Consider providing a high-level overview of the EM procedure in the main text, with the full mathematical details relegated to the appendix.  Illustrative examples could also be helpful.
*   **Elaborate on the Gamma distribution choice:** Provide a more detailed justification for the use of the Gamma distribution, possibly discussing alternative distribution choices and their implications.
*   **Address scalability challenges:** Discuss potential strategies for improving the scalability of the model to larger datasets and higher values of K.
*   **Expand the discussion of identifiability:** Provide a more in-depth analysis of the identifiability issue and its potential impact on the biological interpretation of the components. Address the implications of local minima and consider techniques for checking the stability of the solutions.
*   **Include a more comprehensive comparison to related methods:**  Expand the comparison to other relevant probabilistic models, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of VarNMF in different scenarios.
*   **Add statistical significance test:** it is important to test if differences between groups have statistical significance to ensure that they do not come from noise or random variations between samples.
*    **Address the uniqueness of the solution:** How robust is the proposed solutions? is there a method to test the stability of the solutions?

**Overall:**

VarNMF represents a significant advancement in non-negative matrix factorization for scenarios where source variation is a crucial factor. The paper is well-motivated, and the experimental results demonstrate the model's effectiveness. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper and enhance its impact.
