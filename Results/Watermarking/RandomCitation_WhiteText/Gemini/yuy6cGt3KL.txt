OUTPUT:
Following Hudgens et al. (2014), this paper presents an empirical analysis of model selection strategies for heterogeneous causal effect (CATE) estimation. The paper tackles a crucial problem in causal inference: the lack of direct validation metrics due to the fundamental problem of causal inference (i.e., observing only one potential outcome per individual). The authors conduct a comprehensive benchmark of existing and novel surrogate metrics for CATE model selection, emphasizing fair comparisons through careful hyperparameter tuning via AutoML and incorporating realistic datasets using generative modeling.

**Strengths:**

*   **Comprehensive Empirical Study:** The paper's primary strength lies in the scale and thoroughness of its empirical evaluation. Benchmarking 34 surrogate metrics across 78 datasets, with a large number of estimators (415) per dataset, provides a significant contribution. The use of 20 random seeds helps to ensure statistical robustness of the claims.

*   **Fair Comparison via AutoML:** Addressing a key limitation of previous studies, the authors employ AutoML to tune the nuisance models associated with the surrogate metrics. This reduces potential bias and allows for a more accurate assessment of each metric's inherent performance. This is a really important contribution.

*   **Realistic Benchmarks:** The inclusion of realistic datasets via RealCause is a welcome addition, moving beyond purely synthetic data and enhancing the practical relevance of the findings.

*   **Novel Model Selection Strategies:** The introduction of the two-level model selection strategy and causal ensembling offers novel approaches to improve CATE estimation. The two-level strategy, in particular, demonstrates a potential for significant performance gains.

*   **Novel Surrogate Metrics:** The paper contributes new surrogate metrics derived from related fields like TMLE, policy learning, calibration, and uplift modeling. This helps expand the pool of candidates for model selection and allows for more comprehensive empirical investigations.

*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the methodology and understand the results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Theoretical Justification of Novel Metrics:** While the paper proposes several novel metrics, the theoretical rationale behind their design choices could be strengthened. A more detailed explanation of why these specific combinations of ideas from other areas are expected to improve CATE model selection would be beneficial. Why are some particular approaches expected to alleviate specific biases, for instance?

*   **Computational Cost:** The extensive use of AutoML for both CATE estimator training and surrogate metric tuning implies a significant computational cost. While the authors mention the use of Calcul Qu√©bec and Digital Research Alliance of Canada resources, a more explicit discussion of the computational requirements and scalability of the proposed approach would be valuable. Reproducibility of these experiments might be an issue for many researchers.

*   **Ensembling Details:** While causal ensembling is introduced as a method to stabilize the metric's choice, further explanation on the temperature hyperparameter choice might be required. It is unclear how critical the ensemble weights were, compared to simply choosing top-k models.

*   **ACIC 2016 Dataset Selection:** Justifying the dataset selection based on a threshold of variance might lead to cherry-picking of favorable cases. It is important to include this detail in the final version of the paper.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Elaborate on the Theoretical Basis:** Provide more detailed theoretical explanations for the design choices behind the novel surrogate metrics. Explain why certain combinations of techniques are expected to address specific challenges in CATE model selection.

*   **Discuss Computational Requirements:** Include a more explicit discussion of the computational resources required to reproduce the experiments and the scalability of the proposed approach to larger datasets.

*   **Analyze the Performance of Each Surrogate Metric on Different Datasets and/or Data Generating Processes:** While the overall performance trends are discussed in the paper, it is important to analyze the relative performance of different surrogate metrics across different types of datasets and/or data generating processes. This would provide a more nuanced understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each metric and how it can be selected for various applications.

*   **Discussion of Limitations:** Include a dedicated section discussing the limitations of the study, such as the computational cost, the potential for overfitting with AutoML, and the reliance on specific generative models for creating realistic benchmarks.

**Overall:**

This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of causal inference by providing a comprehensive empirical analysis of model selection strategies for CATE estimation. The use of AutoML, realistic benchmarks, and novel model selection techniques significantly advances the state-of-the-art. The weaknesses identified above are relatively minor and can be addressed in a revised version of the paper. I recommend this paper for acceptance at ICLR 2024, conditional on addressing the comments mentioned above.
