OUTPUT:
Following Devers et al. (2023), this paper introduces DIFUSCO-LNS, a novel Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solver that integrates a neural diffusion model for guiding Large Neighborhood Search (LNS). The core idea is to use a diffusion model to generate effective destroy heuristics, addressing the unimodal limitations of existing neural LNS approaches by capturing the multimodal nature of optimal policies during variable selection. The diffusion model is trained via imitation learning to mimic the Local Branching (LB) destroy heuristic. The paper evaluates DIFUSCO-LNS on four representative MIP problems (MIS, CA, SC, and MVC), demonstrating superior performance compared to prior neural LNS solvers.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The application of diffusion models to the LNS destroy heuristic for general ILP solving is a novel contribution. It's a promising direction to address the limitations of unimodal assumptions in existing neural LNS methods.
*   **Methodological soundness:** The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the DIFUSCO-LNS framework, including the probabilistic formulation, diffusion-based modeling, policy network architecture, and training data generation. The integration of graph neural networks to represent the ILP problem and LNS state is well-motivated.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The experimental results are comprehensive, covering four diverse benchmark datasets and comparing against several strong baselines (BnB, Random-LNS, LB-relax, IL-LNS, and CL-LNS). The evaluation metrics (primal gap, primal integral, and primal bound) are standard in the field. The ablation study examining the effect of diffusion steps and inference schedulers is helpful.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, with a clear problem statement, methodology description, and experimental setup. The figures (especially Figure 1) are informative.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Reproducibility Details:** While the paper describes the method well, more details on the network architecture and hyperparameter settings would enhance reproducibility, although some are in the appendix (mentioned but not included). Specifics about the graph neural network architecture and training regime (e.g., learning rate, optimizer) should be explicitly mentioned either in the main text or the appendix (which is missing from the provided paper).
*   **Computational Resources:** The paper mentions contradictions with previous work regarding baseline performance due to differences in computational resources. While a fair comparison within the same environment is ensured, a more detailed explanation of the resources used (e.g., CPU, GPU, memory) would be beneficial. The authors should clarify how instances were run in parallel, if applicable.
*   **Ablation Study Depth:** The ablation study, while present, could be expanded. It primarily focuses on the number of diffusion steps and inference schedulers. Exploring the impact of different graph neural network architectures or feature engineering choices would provide further insights into the effectiveness of individual components of DIFUSCO-LNS. Also it would be important to show that the computation time added by the use of diffusion model compared to CL-LNS is statistically insignificant, by providing confidence interval and p values.
*   **Transfer Performance Discussion:** The paper claims that DIFUSCO-LNS shows stronger transfer performance, but the improvement compared to CL-LNS on the larger instances is not overwhelmingly large in all cases. A more nuanced discussion of the transferability, including possible explanations for variations across datasets, would strengthen the paper. The reported results on SC-L, which required filtering due to bad initial solutions, also warrant further investigation and discussion.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Provide Appendix:** Include the appendix with detailed network architecture, hyperparameters, and additional experimental results.
*   **Expand Ablation Study:** Consider adding ablations to investigate the impact of different network architectures or feature engineering choices on the overall performance.
*   **Clarify Computational Resources:** Provide specific details on the computational resources used for training and evaluation.
*   **Strengthen Transfer Performance Discussion:** Offer a more in-depth analysis of the transfer performance of DIFUSCO-LNS, addressing the observed variations across datasets and the challenges encountered with SC-L instances.
*   **Address Running time claim:** Provide additional details on the statistical significance of running time.

**Overall Score:**

I would rate this paper as a **6 (Weak Accept)**. The idea is novel and promising, and the initial results are encouraging. However, the paper needs to address the weaknesses outlined above to be considered a strong accept. The main areas for improvement are providing more detailed implementation information for reproducibility and strengthening the empirical evaluation and discussion.
