OUTPUT:
Following Hawley et al. (2015), this paper proposes an actor-critic reinforcement learning approach for generating geodesics on manifolds, specifically focusing on path planning tasks. The key idea is the introduction of "midpoint trees," a modification of sub-goal trees, where the policy learns to predict midpoints between two given points. The paper provides a theoretical justification, demonstrating that under certain assumptions, the learned policy converges to predicting true midpoints in the limit of infinite tree depth. Experimental results on path planning tasks, including a sloped ground scenario, non-holonomic vehicles, and robotic arm motion planning, are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to sequential reinforcement learning and policy gradient-based sub-goal tree generation.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The concept of midpoint trees and the associated actor-critic learning framework offer a novel approach to geodesic generation, particularly in scenarios where distance functions are not readily available or computationally expensive to compute.
*   **Theoretical Justification:** The theoretical analysis provides a solid foundation for the proposed method, demonstrating convergence to true midpoints under specified conditions.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The paper presents experiments on diverse path planning tasks, showcasing the method's ability to outperform existing techniques, especially in the challenging non-holonomic vehicle environment and robotic arm obstacle avoidance scenario.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and explains the proposed method and its theoretical underpinnings in a clear and understandable manner.
*   **Reproducibility:** The inclusion of implementation details, hyperparameter settings, and supplementary materials aimed at enabling reproducibility is a significant strength.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Assumptions:** The theoretical analysis relies on assumptions such as the compactness of the space, the existence of the midpoint property, and the equicontinuity of the value function sequence. The practical implications and limitations of these assumptions could be discussed further. Furthermore, the reliance on infinitesimal metric knowledge, while arguably realistic, limits the general applicability of the approach.
*   **Environment Specificity:** The success of the method appears to be dependent on the specific characteristics of the environment and the reward function design. While the paper argues that it avoids manually tuning reward functions, the selection of the appropriate loss function (equations 6, 17, 18) still requires some understanding of the underlying metric. This point deserves further discussion.
*   **Limited Comparison:** While the comparisons to sequential RL and policy gradient are valuable, comparisons to other path planning algorithms, especially those used in robotics, are missing. Discussing the performance relative to traditional methods such as RRT or potential fields would be beneficial to the robotics audience.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** While the paper provides hyperparameters, there's limited discussion regarding the sensitivity of the results to these parameters.
*   **Runtime Analysis:** While it provides steps, runtime analysis isn't discussed. This would be a nice addition, and would help highlight the strength of the method.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Discuss the limitations of the assumptions:** Provide a more detailed discussion of the assumptions underlying the theoretical analysis and their potential impact on the method's performance in real-world scenarios. In particular, the case of non-compact spaces or metrics lacking the continuous midpoint property should be considered.
*   **Elaborate on the reward function design:** Provide more justification for the choice of loss functions in the actor (equations 6, 17, 18). Explore the effects of different loss functions on the performance of the algorithm. Explain why the performance of the "Intermediate Point" variant is so close to the "Ours" method for some tasks, but not others. What is the intuition for this?
*   **Expand the experimental comparisons:** Include comparisons to traditional path planning algorithms, such as RRT or potential field methods, to provide a broader context for the method's performance.
*   **Address hyperparameter sensitivity:** Discuss the sensitivity of the results to the choice of hyperparameters and provide guidelines for selecting appropriate values for different environments.
*   **Provide runtime analysis**: Discuss how runtime is affected by the increased complexity of the method as compared to baseline methods.
*   **Address Negative Results**: Results for robot arm collision avoidance weren't perfect. How will this be handled in future versions of the method?

**Overall:**

This paper presents a promising approach to geodesic generation using reinforcement learning. The combination of midpoint trees and actor-critic learning offers a novel and theoretically sound framework for path planning. The experimental results demonstrate the method's potential to outperform existing techniques in certain challenging scenarios. Addressing the identified weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements would further strengthen the paper and enhance its impact.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend this paper for acceptance, subject to addressing the identified weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements.
