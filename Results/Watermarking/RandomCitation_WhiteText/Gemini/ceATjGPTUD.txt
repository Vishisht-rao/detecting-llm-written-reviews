OUTPUT:
Following Scoggins et al. (2023), this paper presents a method for improving the noise robustness of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems using large language models (LLMs). The authors extend the generative error correction (GER) framework to noisy conditions and introduce a "Robust HyPoradise" dataset. The core idea is to extract a language-space noise embedding from the N-best hypotheses of the ASR output and use this embedding to condition the LLM during fine-tuning. This allows the LLM to perform denoising in the language space, mitigating the cross-modality gap that arises when directly incorporating audio features. A knowledge distillation approach is also proposed to enhance the noise representation ability of the language embedding. The experiments demonstrate significant improvements in word error rate (WER) on various noisy datasets using several popular LLMs.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The approach of extracting a language-space noise embedding and using it for denoising within the GER framework is novel and addresses a crucial challenge in noisy ASR. The paper clearly articulates why this approach is superior to directly using audio embeddings.
*   **Thorough Evaluation:** The paper includes comprehensive experiments on various noisy datasets (CHiME-4, VoiceBank-DEMAND, NOIZEUS, LibriSpeech-FreeSound, RATS) and with several LLMs (LLaMA-2-7b/13b, LLaMA-7b, Falcon-7b). The ablation studies are well-designed and provide valuable insights into the contribution of different components. The experiments on different SNR levels further strengthen the evaluation.
*   **Significant Results:** The results demonstrate a significant improvement in WER compared to baseline methods and even surpass the rescoring upper bound in some cases. The high WER reduction (up to 53.9%) is compelling.
*   **Data Efficiency:** The data efficiency analysis is a significant finding, suggesting the method's practicality for scenarios with limited training data.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and clearly explains the proposed method. The figures are helpful in understanding the framework and embedding extraction process.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors mention that the code and dataset will be open-sourced, which is a huge plus for reproducibility and further research.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Novelty in Dataset:** While the extension of HyPoradise to a noisy setting is valuable, the core methodology behind creating RobustHP involves established datasets and a standard recipe of noising. More details on any data cleaning or preparation steps might be useful.
*   **Dependency on Whisper:** The method relies heavily on the Whisper model for generating N-best hypotheses. The performance might be influenced by the quality of Whisper's output, especially for extremely noisy conditions. A discussion on the limitations imposed by Whisper, perhaps an analysis of error types it commonly makes on these datasets, and a discussion of how alternative ASR models could be integrated might be beneficial.
*   **Limited Insight into Failure Cases:** While a failure case is presented, a more in-depth analysis of failure modes would be useful. What types of errors does the system still struggle with? Are there specific noise types or SNR levels where the performance degrades significantly? A more systematic error analysis would provide a better understanding of the system's limitations and potential areas for improvement. The discussion of the homophone limitation could be expanded.
*   **Clarity of Hyperparameter Choice:** The reason behind setting the prompt length U to N*(N-1) is unclear. A more detailed explanation of this choice and its potential impact on performance is needed. A sensitivity analysis of the hyperparameter lambda is also missing.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand Dataset Description:** Provide more details about the "Robust HyPoradise" dataset, including specific data cleaning steps, noise addition techniques and any augmentations used. Include a detailed breakdown of the data distribution by noise type and SNR levels.
*   **Analyze Whisper's Impact:** Discuss the influence of Whisper's performance on the overall system. Explore the effect of using different ASR models or fine-tuning Whisper on the noisy datasets. Consider including a comparison against other ASR systems.
*   **Conduct Systematic Error Analysis:** Perform a more systematic error analysis to identify the types of errors the system still struggles with. This could involve categorizing errors into different classes (e.g., substitutions, insertions, deletions) and analyzing their frequency for different noise conditions.
*   **Justify Hyperparameter Choices:** Provide a more detailed explanation of the hyperparameter choices, especially the prompt length U and lambda. Justify those settings, and if possible conduct a sensitivity analysis to assess their impact on the final performance.
*   **More analysis on CHiME-4 improvements:** A more granular error analysis on the improvements seen in CHiME-4 would be interesting given the relative gains on that dataset.
*   **Discussion of computational cost:** A brief discussion of the computational cost of training and inference would be useful for readers.

**Overall Score:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach for noise-robust ASR. The experimental results are compelling, and the paper is well-written and clear. Despite the weaknesses noted above, the contributions of this work are significant. Therefore, I recommend this paper for acceptance with minor revisions.
