OUTPUT:
Following Henn et al. (2019), this paper presents an interesting investigation into the optimization landscape of Transformers by studying a simplified linear Transformer model. The central claim is that this linear model can reproduce several distinctive features of Transformer training dynamics, suggesting its potential as a valuable abstraction for understanding optimization challenges.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clarity and Motivation:** The paper clearly articulates the difficulty of training Transformers and motivates the need for a simpler model. The introduction effectively highlights the shortcomings of standard optimization theory assumptions in this context.
*   **Well-Defined Model:** The linear Transformer model is well-defined and reasonably simple, making it amenable to analysis. The authors provide justification for their architectural choices, particularly the removal of softmax and feedforward networks.
*   **Reproducing Key Features:** The paper convincingly demonstrates that the linear Transformer model reproduces several key features observed in full Transformer training, including the Adam > SGD phenomenon, heavy-tailed gradient noise, and ill-conditioned loss landscape. The figures effectively illustrate these similarities.
*   **Controlled Experiments:** The controlled experiments varying data distribution (heavy-tailedness) and network depth are valuable for understanding the influence of these factors on the optimization landscape.
*   **Relevant Connections:** The paper makes strong connections to prior work in Transformer optimization, including Zhang et al. (2020a, 2020b), Kunstner et al. (2023), and Jiang et al. (2022), which helps to position the paper within the existing literature.
*   **Code & Reproducibility (implied):** The paper seems to provide enough detail about hyperparameter and the model that its main results could be easily reproduced.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Lack of Theoretical Justification:** The paper acknowledges the lack of a solid theoretical foundation for the observed phenomena. While empirical observations are valuable, theoretical insights would significantly strengthen the claims. A deeper mathematical analysis of why linear Transformers exhibit these features would be highly desirable.
*   **Limited Scope of Linear Regression:** The linear regression setting, while simpler, might not fully capture the complexities of language data and tasks used in Transformer optimization. This limits the generalizability of the findings. While nonlinear regression experiments were performed, it's not clear whether this fully addresses the limitation.
*   **Depth and Capacity of Linear Transformers:** While the paper examines the impact of the number of layers on the optimization, it doesn't fully explore the capacity or representation ability of linear Transformers. Understanding how the representation power scales with depth in this simplified model could provide valuable insights.
*   **Limited novelty on the method side.** The paper provides a good empirical and qualitative understanding of the Transformer optimization. However, it may be less impactful as a method paper.
*   **Lack of quantitative metrics:** While the plots and tables are effective in comparing different settings and optimization methods, the paper would benefit from including quantitative metrics that can be used to assess the degree to which the linear Transformer replicates the optimization behavior of full Transformers. For example, one could define a distance metric between the gradient noise distributions or condition number trajectories of the two models.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Theoretical Analysis:** Even a preliminary theoretical analysis of the loss landscape of the linear Transformer model would significantly enhance the paper's contribution. For example, could the authors provide any theoretical justification on why linear Transformer gives heavy tailed stochastic gradients?
*   **Broader Task Evaluation:** While linear regression provides a controlled environment, exploring other simple tasks (e.g., nonlinear regression with more complex functions) could increase the generalizability of the findings.
*   **Addressing Limitation of Lack of Softmax:** The paper mentions that the lack of softmax may lead to denser attention scores. It would be beneficial to explore this difference empirically and investigate its potential impact on the optimization landscape. Perhaps, some form of weight decay or L1 regularization could encourage sparse attention patterns in the linear model.
*   **Quantitative comparison with full Transformer.** While the paper compared the behavior of SGD vs Adam, and heavy-tailedness of the gradient stochastic noise, it would be better to make the comparison quantitative.
*   **Explain Easter Egg better.** The term 'Easter Egg' is vaguely defined. A bit more explanation of this phenomenon would be good.
*   **Write clearer title.** While the title is interesting, the "(MAYBE )" part doesn't look good.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the understanding of Transformer optimization by introducing and analyzing a simplified linear model. While the lack of theoretical justification and the limited scope of linear regression are weaknesses, the paper's clarity, well-defined model, convincing empirical results, and relevant connections to prior work make it a worthwhile submission. Addressing the suggestions for improvement would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact.
