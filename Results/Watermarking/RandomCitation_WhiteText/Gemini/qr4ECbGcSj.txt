OUTPUT:
Following Comfort et al. (2018), this paper tackles an important and timely problem in reinforcement learning: the expressivity of different objective specification formalisms. The paper comprehensively compares 17 formalisms and presents a Hasse diagram illustrating their relative expressive power. The central argument is that no single formalism is both dominantly expressive and easily optimizable with current techniques, highlighting the need for practitioners to be familiar with a variety of formalisms and for future research to address the expressivity limitations of current reward learning methods.

**Strengths:**

*   **Comprehensive Scope:** The paper offers a broad and detailed comparison of a large set of objective specification formalisms. This is a significant contribution, as it brings together a fragmented literature and provides a unified framework for analysis.
*   **Rigorous Methodology:** The paper employs a well-defined notion of expressivity based on the ability to express policy orderings, and uses mathematical proofs to establish the relationships between formalisms. The clear definitions and formal proofs enhance the credibility of the results.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The Hasse diagram is an effective way to visualize the complex relationships between the formalisms. The paper's structure is logical, and the explanations are generally clear.
*   **Practical Relevance:** The paper's findings have direct implications for RL practitioners, who need to choose appropriate objective specification formalisms for their tasks. The discussion of limitations and the call for future research on reward learning with more expressive formalisms is valuable.
*   **Connection to Existing Literature:** The paper does a good job of connecting its results to existing work on the reward hypothesis, the VNM utility theorem, and specific formalisms like MORL, Reward Machines, and LTL. This helps to contextualize the paper's contribution within the broader research landscape.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Tractability Tradeoff:** While the paper acknowledges the tradeoff between expressivity and tractability, it doesn't provide concrete guidance on how to balance these two considerations in practice. This is a significant limitation, as the more expressive formalisms may be too computationally expensive to use in many real-world scenarios. Further discussions (possibly including time/space complexity) or suggestions for future research directions to bridge this gap would add significant value.
*   **Restricting Conditions:** Some results rely on theoretical constructs that may not be readily available in practice. As the authors admit (Appendix A.4) the dependence on infinite precision and arbitrary wrapper functions reduces the impact in the practical domains. Further consideration on the potential for analysis under restricted conditions would make the results more applicable.
*   **Stationary Policies:** The focus on stationary policies may limit the applicability of the results in environments where history-dependent policies are necessary. Although the authors provide a table of the expressivity relationships for history-dependent policies this is an incomplete discussion that requires expansion and exploration.
*   **Axiomatic Foundation:** While the discussion of the VNM theorem and its axioms is relevant, the paper could benefit from a more in-depth exploration of whether the objectives that Markov rewards and functions from trajectories to reals *cannot* express are truly reasonable and practically relevant. A deeper argument for *why* violating the axioms may be justified in specific scenarios would strengthen the paper's impact.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand the discussion of the expressivity-tractability tradeoff.** Provide more concrete examples of how the choice of objective specification formalism can impact the computational cost of policy optimization. Suggest practical techniques for trading off expressivity and tractability.
*   **Conduct further analysis under more realistic restricting conditions.** Investigate the impact of limited precision, constraints on wrapper functions, and restrictions on the number of reward functions in multi-objective formalisms.
*   **Provide a more comprehensive analysis of history-dependent policies.** Extend the expressivity comparison to include a wider range of formalisms and address the challenges of defining objectives for history-dependent policies.
*   **Offer a more nuanced discussion of the VNM axioms.** Provide a more compelling argument for why violating the axioms may be necessary or desirable in certain RL tasks. Discuss the practical implications of violating these axioms.
*   **Consider the use of examples in each proof for improved understandability**

**Overall:**

This is a well-written and important paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning. The comprehensive comparison of objective specification formalisms and the identification of their expressivity limitations are valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners. While the paper has some limitations, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, and the paper is worthy of acceptance to the conference.
