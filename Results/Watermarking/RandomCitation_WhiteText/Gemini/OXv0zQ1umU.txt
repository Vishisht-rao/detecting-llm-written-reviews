OUTPUT:
Following Bankhead et al. (2019), this paper presents Evoke, a novel automatic prompt refinement framework designed to enhance critical thinking abilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). The core idea revolves around an iterative author-reviewer paradigm, where one LLM instance acts as a reviewer, scoring the current prompt, and another instance acts as an author, refining the prompt based on the reviewer's feedback and edit history. The paper further incorporates a data selection strategy, focusing on "hard" samples to foster deeper understanding. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains compared to existing methods, particularly in challenging tasks like logical fallacy detection.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The author-reviewer paradigm for automatic prompt refinement is a compelling and novel approach. The cyclical feedback loop and the explicit memory component for both author and reviewer are well-reasoned and contribute to the framework's efficacy.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and clearly articulates the problem, proposed solution, and experimental setup. The inclusion of figures (e.g., Figure 2 illustrating the Evoke workflow) enhances understanding.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The experimental results are compelling. The significant performance improvements on various tasks compared to human-curated prompts and APE are strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of Evoke. The analysis of adversarial robustness and fine-grained NER further strengthens the claims.
*   **Ablation Studies:** The analysis section, particularly the investigation of the LLM-Reviewer's scoring ability and the impact of the LLM-Selector (hard sample selection), provides valuable insights into the contributions of individual components of the framework.
*   **Reproducibility:** The inclusion of Algorithm 1 and the detailed descriptions of the prompts used for each LLM role enhance the potential for reproducibility. The appendix further provides generated instructions from all the tasks performed.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Model Dependency:** The paper heavily relies on GPT-4. While impressive results are shown, the extent to which Evoke's benefits generalize to other LLMs (especially smaller or open-source models) is not fully explored (addressed in the additional experiments in the appendix). Showing a broader applicability would greatly increase the impact. However, the models Mistral-7B-Openorca and Llama2-70B-Instruct were tested in the appendix, which did improve the robustness of the study.
*   **Computational Cost:** The paper lacks discussion of the computational cost associated with Evoke. The iterative process of authoring, reviewing, and data selection could be computationally expensive, particularly for large datasets and complex tasks. A discussion of the time complexity and resource requirements would be valuable.
*   **Clarity of "Hard" Sample Definition:** While the concept of "hard" samples is intuitive, the paper could benefit from a more precise definition. The difficulty scoring by LLM-Selector is subjective. Are there any objective metrics or characteristics that consistently identify "hard" samples across different tasks?
*   **Generalizability of Prompts:** The generated prompts, while effective, might be highly specific to the tasks and datasets used in the experiments. The paper could discuss the potential challenges in adapting Evoke to new tasks or domains with different characteristics.
*   **Instruction Induction:** While the paper has additional experiments that show the robustness of different instruction inductions, the paper does not discuss the initial prompt generation extensively in the main text. The effect of the initial prompt on the final result should be discussed, as this may alter the number of iterations required.
*   **Lack of Discussion on Failure Cases:** The paper primarily focuses on the successes of Evoke. A discussion of potential failure cases or limitations of the approach would provide a more balanced perspective.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective framework for automatic prompt refinement. The experimental results are compelling, and the analysis provides valuable insights. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above, particularly concerning model dependency, computational cost, and the definition of "hard" samples, would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact. The addition of experiments on open source models in the Appendix is a welcome addition. I would recommend this paper for acceptance.
