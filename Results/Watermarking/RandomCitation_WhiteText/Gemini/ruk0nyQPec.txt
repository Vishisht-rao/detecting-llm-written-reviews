**Following Hartsell et al. (2019), this paper** presents SILO, a novel approach to language model training that aims to mitigate legal risks associated with training on copyrighted or restricted data. The core idea is to decouple the language model into a parametric component trained on permissively licensed data (the OPEN LICENSE CORPUS - OLC) and a nonparametric datastore containing potentially high-risk data used only during inference. This allows the model to leverage a broader range of data without directly training on it, facilitating data attribution and opt-out mechanisms. The authors evaluate SILO's performance on various language modeling tasks and downstream text classification, demonstrating that the datastore effectively bridges the performance gap caused by training only on low-risk data.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses a critical problem:** The paper tackles a very relevant and timely issue - the legality of training large language models on copyrighted material. The proposed solution is both technically interesting and practically important, as legal scrutiny of LM training practices intensifies.
*   **Novel Approach:** The SILO approach offers a compelling alternative to traditional LM training pipelines. It separates the training process into two distinct components (parametric and non-parametric), effectively managing the risk-performance tradeoff. The ability to update the datastore and allow data owners to opt-out is a significant advantage.
*   **Thorough Evaluation:** The paper presents a comprehensive set of experiments to evaluate SILO's performance. The evaluation spans a wide range of domains (both in-domain and out-of-domain) and tasks (language modeling and text classification), providing strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
*   **Detailed Analysis:** The authors don't just present results; they also provide insightful analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the different components of SILO (kNN-LM vs. RIC-LM) and identify avenues for future improvements. The ablation studies are well-designed and informative.
*   **OPEN LICENSE CORPUS Contribution:** The curation and release of the OPEN LICENSE CORPUS (OLC) itself is a significant contribution. Providing a large dataset of permissively licensed text enables further research in this area.
*   **Clear and well-written:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, making the complex concepts accessible. The figures and tables are clear and informative.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Data set skewness:** The OLC, while a valuable resource, exhibits a skewed distribution towards code, legal, and scientific text. While the authors acknowledge this and employ upweighting strategies, this inherent skewness can affect the generality of the parametric LM. More sophisticated domain weighting strategies could be further explored.
*   **Non-parametric component limitations:** the Non-parametric component also poses practical limitations. The authors only explored data availability *at inference* for each test domain. In practical setups, this may be unrealistic, or even a way to defeat the purpose of a low-risk model. Furthermore, the current implementation of kNN-LM, despite outperforming RIC-LM, has a significant runtime speed disadvantage compared to parametric LMs. Further runtime optimizations can be explored.
*   **Definition of Attribution:** The term "attribution" remains fuzzy and undefined. Providing citations may not be sufficient, and does not truly protect data ownership. What is considered an attribution, and how does the current approach truly fulfill the requirement?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Discussion of downstream effects:** The paper can consider expanding on the downstream effects of SILO. SILO is not a silver bullet, and still cannot completely eliminate legal risk.
*   **Scalability to extremely large datastores:** While the paper explores scaling the datastore to 1 billion tokens, the authors can consider exploring datastore scalability further. This can highlight the scalability issues for SILO.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that addresses an important problem with a novel and well-executed approach. The SILO framework offers a promising direction for building legally compliant and high-performing language models. While some limitations exist, the paper provides a solid foundation for future research in this area. I highly recommend this paper for acceptance.
