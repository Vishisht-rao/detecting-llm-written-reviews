OUTPUT:
Following Crooks et al. (2020), this paper presents a novel variational lower bound (VLB-IRL) for inverse reinforcement learning. The core idea revolves around formulating IRL as a probabilistic graphical model, explicitly incorporating reward and optimality as key random variables. The authors derive a lower bound on the likelihood of the reward model given expert trajectories, leading to a reverse KL divergence minimization between an approximated optimality distribution (conditioned on the reward) and the true optimality distribution (conditioned on trajectories). The method simultaneously learns the reward function and the policy under the learned reward. The authors claim improved performance compared to existing state-of-the-art IRL algorithms across several continuous control domains.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The proposed VLB-IRL framework appears to be a novel approach to IRL, offering a fresh perspective using probabilistic graphical models and a variational lower bound. The explicit modeling of optimality is interesting.
*   **Theoretical Foundation:** The paper provides a detailed derivation of the variational lower bound, offering theoretical justification for the proposed method. The connection to reverse KL divergence is clearly stated.
*   **Empirical Evaluation:** The experiments cover a range of Mujoco benchmark domains and a more realistic assistive robotics environment (Assistive Gym). The inclusion of both optimal and noisy expert trajectories is valuable for assessing robustness. The comparison to several strong baselines (AIRL, f-IRL, EBIL, IQ-Learn, GAIL) strengthens the evaluation.
*   **Clear Presentation (mostly):** The paper is generally well-written and organized, with a clear explanation of the motivation, methodology, and experimental results. The graphical model is helpful for understanding the relationships between variables.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity in Approximations:** Section 2.3 could benefit from a more intuitive explanation of the approximated optimality distribution, `q(Ot|rt)`. While the mathematical formulation is present, the practical implications and rationale behind the chosen approximation are not entirely clear. More specifically, justifying the reparameterization trick in the context of a distribution over rewards would be beneficial. The connection between the reward *value* and the *optimality* seems somewhat weak.
*   **Limited Theoretical Analysis:** While the derivation of the lower bound is presented, there's a lack of deeper theoretical analysis. The paper mentions the reward ambiguity problem but the mitigation of this via the reverse KL divergence is not sufficiently fleshed out. Demonstrating the *tightness* of the lower bound is crucial but lacking, as acknowledged in the conclusion.
*   **Justification for Reverse KL:** The paper highlights the benefits of using reverse KL divergence for robustness to noisy expert trajectories. However, a more in-depth discussion comparing and contrasting the properties of forward and reverse KL divergence in this specific context would be beneficial. A comparison with Expectation-Maximization algorithms and their potential suitability would be useful.
*   **Algorithmic Details:** Algorithm 1 provides a high-level overview but lacks crucial implementation details. Specifying how the classifier and reward function are updated (e.g., loss functions, optimization algorithms) would improve reproducibility. The interplay between reward function variance and learner policy stability warrants further explanation.
*   **Experimental Ablation:** While the paper presents a thorough comparison against state-of-the-art methods, it lacks an ablation study to investigate the impact of individual components of the VLB-IRL framework (e.g., the variance regularization term, the specific form of the optimality approximation). It would be interesting to see results with and without the lambda term.
*   **Related Work:** There's related work on using the same principles for Imitation Learning in the absence of the reward (for example in Viano et al. (2021)). These should be cited and discussed. Similarly, more recent results of Arora and Doshi (2021b) and Schlaginhaufen and Kamgarpour (2023) should be cited and their relevance discussed. Kim et al. (2021) discusses Reward Identification in IRL which is highly relevant and should be cited.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand on the intuition and practical implications of the optimality approximation.** Provide a more concrete example of how `q(Ot|rt)` is used in practice and how it relates to the agent's behavior.
*   **Include an ablation study** to assess the impact of individual components of the VLB-IRL framework.
*   **Provide more implementation details** for Algorithm 1, including loss functions, optimization algorithms, and other relevant settings.
*   **Perform a more rigorous theoretical analysis** of the properties of the VLB-IRL framework, including the tightness of the lower bound and convergence guarantees.
*   **Elaborate on the differences and advantages of using reverse KL divergence** compared to other divergence measures in the context of noisy expert trajectories.
*   **Address the limitations** mentioned in the conclusion more explicitly and discuss potential solutions or future research directions.
*   **Expand on the related works as suggested in Weaknesses**.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a promising new approach to inverse reinforcement learning. The VLB-IRL framework is theoretically grounded and empirically validated. While there are some weaknesses in the presentation and analysis, the potential impact of this work warrants further investigation. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the aforementioned weaknesses.
