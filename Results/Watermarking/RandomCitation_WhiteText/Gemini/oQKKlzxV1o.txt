OUTPUT:
Following Diedrich et al. (2021), this paper tackles the challenging problem of online information acquisition using multiple agents, a setting more realistic but significantly more complex than the single-agent scenarios typically studied. The authors model the problem as a mechanism design game, where the principal aims to incentivize truthful reporting and effort from the agents through action recommendations and scoring rules.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Problem Setting:** The move from single-agent to multi-agent information acquisition is a valuable contribution. The paper correctly identifies the key challenges of coordinating agents' efforts and aggregating correlated information.
*   **Algorithmic Contributions:** The polynomial-time algorithm for finding an optimal incentive-compatible mechanism is a significant achievement. The LP relaxation technique and the recovery of a solution are well-explained.
*   **Online Learning Algorithm:** The design of a no-regret algorithm that matches the state-of-the-art bound for single-agent settings is impressive. The algorithm's three-phase structure (estimation of probabilities, estimation of costs, and commit phase) is well-defined and addresses the core challenges of the online learning problem.
*   **Theoretical Analysis:** The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis, including proofs of incentive compatibility, regret bounds, and characterizations of correlated vs. uncorrelated mechanisms. The clean events and lemmas are used effectively to establish the theoretical guarantees.
*   **Clarity of Writing:** While the technical details are dense, the paper is generally well-written and organized. The introduction clearly motivates the problem and summarizes the contributions. The algorithm overview provides a good high-level understanding before delving into the details.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Complexity:** The paper is technically very dense and requires a strong background in mechanism design, optimization, and online learning. The notation can be overwhelming at times, and some of the proofs are difficult to follow without significant effort. Making certain sections more intuitive or providing additional explanation would increase the paper's accessibility.
*   **Practical Considerations:** While the paper makes a solid theoretical contribution, there is a relative lack of discussion of practical implementation. The paper acknowledges that correlated mechanisms are suboptimal under certain conditions. It does not, however, discuss how one would determine whether to employ correlated or uncorrelated mechanisms in a real world problem. This limits the applicability of the paper to real world conditions.
*   **Assumption 1:** Assumption 1 is a standard assumption but a strong one. Discussion of its limitations and possible relaxations is warranted. The paper does not acknowledge that the learner has to "know" the scoring rules ahead of time, and it is not necessarily clear how these would be obtained, potentially adding extra complexity to the analysis.
*   **Constant *n* assumption:** This assumption limits the paper's scope somewhat, even though the authors state that it avoids computational issues related to exponential-size representation. It would be good to state more clearly whether the results can be extended if `n` is not constant, and if not, to justify why that is.
*   **Clarity in Section 4**: While the paper recognizes the drawback of correlated mechanisms in non-IC settings in Section 4, this section could benefit from more examples and discussion. The computational complexity and equilibrium selection problems associated with correlated mechanisms could be explained more clearly. Additionally, while Theorem 4.2 provides a sufficient condition for optimal mechanisms to be uncorrelated, more examples of cases in which this condition holds are warranted.
*   **Typos and Grammatical Errors:** A few minor typos and grammatical errors are present throughout the text (e.g., in Equation 3) that should be corrected.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Provide More Intuition:** Include more intuitive explanations of the key concepts and results. Break down the complex equations and algorithms into smaller, more manageable steps. Consider providing illustrative examples to clarify the theoretical concepts.
*   **Discuss Practical Implications:** Discuss the practical limitations of the proposed algorithms and potential avenues for future research. Address the problem of how to best determine whether to employ uncorrelated or correlated mechanisms in real-world conditions.
*   **Address Assumption 1:** Discuss the limitations of assumption 1 and possible relaxations thereof. Explore ways to reduce the reliance on this strong assumption.
*   **Refine Presentation:** Improve the clarity and consistency of the notation. Carefully proofread the paper to correct typos and grammatical errors.

**Overall:**

This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of online mechanism design for information acquisition. The proposed algorithms and theoretical results are novel and technically sound. While the paper is complex and requires a strong background, the contributions are valuable and address an important problem. With some revisions to improve clarity and discuss practical considerations, this paper would be a strong addition to the conference.
