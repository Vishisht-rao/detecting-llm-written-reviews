OUTPUT:
Following Kegley et al. (2015), this paper investigates the robustness of reinforcement learning (RL) policies, specifically focusing on the vulnerabilities of policies trained using imitation learning (IL) and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) compared to vanilla deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The central argument is that policies trained without explicit reward functions (IL/IRL) are more susceptible to adversarial perturbations and small deviations from optimal trajectories than DRL policies. The authors theoretically motivate and empirically demonstrate this non-robustness, linking it to limited exploration and a resulting misalignment between the policy's learned beliefs and the true environment rewards.

**Strengths:**

*   **Timely and Relevant Problem:** The paper addresses a crucial issue in RL, namely the robustness and reliability of policies, particularly in the context of learning without rewards. This is especially relevant considering the increasing use of RLHF in areas like large language models, where value alignment is paramount.
*   **Clear Research Questions:** The research questions are well-defined and provide a clear focus for the investigation.
*   **Theoretical Motivation:** The paper provides a theoretical framework (Lemma 3.1, Proposition 3.3, Corollary 3.4) to explain the observed vulnerabilities of IL/IRL policies, which strengthens the argument. The subspace-contained expert trajectory model is a useful abstraction.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The empirical results, particularly those in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3 and Figure 1, provide strong support for the theoretical claims. The use of different adversarial settings (Arandom alg+M, Arandom M, Aaw, Arandom) helps to isolate and characterize the vulnerabilities.
*   **Well-Structured and Written:** The paper is generally well-structured and written, making the arguments relatively easy to follow. The introduction clearly sets the stage, and the related work section provides sufficient context. The conclusion effectively summarizes the key findings and their implications.
*   **Clear Definitions:** The definitions of key concepts, such as adversarial directions and deviation from optimal trajectories, are precise.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Scope of Algorithms:** While the paper focuses on a state-of-the-art inverse Q-learning algorithm, the comparison is essentially limited to this single IL/IRL approach against a vanilla DRL method (DDQN). Exploring a broader range of IL/IRL algorithms (e.g., GAIL, AIRL) would strengthen the generality of the findings.
*   **Simplified Theoretical Model:** The subspace-contained expert trajectory model (Definition 3.2) is a strong assumption that might not hold in many real-world scenarios. While it facilitates theoretical analysis, it limits the applicability of the theoretical results. A more relaxed assumption, perhaps incorporating some form of 'leakage' from the expert subspace, could improve the model's realism.
*   **Lack of Mitigation Strategies:** The paper primarily focuses on demonstrating the vulnerabilities of IL/IRL policies. It would be valuable to include a discussion of potential mitigation strategies. Are there techniques (e.g., adversarial training, regularization) that could be used to improve the robustness of these policies without sacrificing performance?
*   **Limited Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis:** The `\(\epsilon\)` value in the `\(\epsilon\)`-deviation setting and the `\(\delta\)` (norm bound) value for adversarial perturbations seem crucial. A sensitivity analysis showing how these hyperparameters influence the results would be beneficial. The authors mention the choice of norm bound in the text but a more detailed analysis would be needed.
*   **Generalization across MDPs:** The experiments are conducted in a limited set of Atari games. It would be helpful to discuss the potential for generalization to other types of MDPs with different characteristics (e.g., continuous state spaces, sparse rewards).
*   **Citations:** While the citations are mostly relevant, more citations to recent Imitation Learning algorithms, outside of the discussed Inverse Soft-Q learning, would be more helpful.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand the algorithm comparison:** Include results for a wider range of IL/IRL algorithms, if computationally feasible.
*   **Refine the theoretical model:** Relax the assumptions of the subspace-contained expert trajectory model or explore alternative theoretical frameworks.
*   **Discuss potential mitigation strategies:** Explore and discuss techniques for improving the robustness of IL/IRL policies.
*   **Include hyperparameter sensitivity analysis:** Investigate how the `\(\epsilon\)` and `\(\delta\)` values influence the results.
*   **Discuss generalizability:** Address the limitations of the experimental setup and discuss the potential for generalization to other MDPs.
*   **Proofread carefully:** There are several minor grammatical errors and typos throughout the paper.

**Overall:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the understanding of robustness in reinforcement learning. The theoretical motivation and empirical results convincingly demonstrate that IL/IRL policies can be more vulnerable to adversarial perturbations and deviations from optimal trajectories than vanilla DRL policies. While there are some limitations, the paper provides a solid foundation for future research in this important area. I recommend acceptance, conditional on addressing the suggested improvements.
