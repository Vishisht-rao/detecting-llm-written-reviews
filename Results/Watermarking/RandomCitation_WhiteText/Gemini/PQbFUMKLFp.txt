OUTPUT:
Following Hyman et al. (2023), this paper presents a novel decentralized Riemannian conjugate gradient descent (DRCGD) method for optimization problems constrained to the Stiefel manifold. The motivation is clear: large-scale machine learning and other applications often involve data distributed across multiple nodes, making decentralized optimization techniques crucial. The paper identifies a gap in the literature regarding decentralized conjugate gradient methods on Riemannian manifolds, specifically the Stiefel manifold.

The core contribution lies in the development of the DRCGD algorithm, which aims to minimize a global function represented as a sum of local functions distributed across a network of agents. A key feature of the proposed method is its avoidance of computationally expensive Riemannian geometric operations like retractions, exponential maps, and vector transports. This is achieved through the use of projection operators, leading to a computationally efficient algorithm. The authors claim that DRCGD is the first decentralized Riemannian conjugate gradient algorithm to achieve global convergence on the Stiefel manifold.

The paper is reasonably well-structured. The introduction provides adequate context and motivation. Section 2 clearly defines the necessary notation and preliminaries related to Riemannian manifolds. Section 3 details the consensus problem on the Stiefel manifold. Section 4 presents the DRCGD algorithm and outlines its convergence analysis. Finally, Section 5 offers numerical experiments to validate the theoretical results.

Strengths of the paper include:

*   **Novelty:** The DRCGD algorithm appears to be a genuinely novel contribution to the field of decentralized Riemannian optimization.
*   **Practicality:** The focus on reducing computational complexity by avoiding expensive Riemannian operations makes the proposed method more practical for large-scale problems.
*   **Global Convergence:** The claim of achieving global convergence is a significant result.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world (MNIST) datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. The comparison against DRDGD and DPRGD helps to contextualize the performance of DRCGD.
*   **Clear Presentation of Algorithm:** The steps of Algorithm 1 are clearly laid out.

Potential Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:

*   **Extended Assumption:** The extended assumption (20) regarding the projection operator requires closer scrutiny. While it is presented as a substitute for a bounded vector transport, more justification or intuition regarding its validity and scope would be beneficial. The relationship between Assumption (20) and more standard assumptions in Riemannian optimization should be discussed. It would be useful to explore cases where this assumption might not hold and what the consequences are.
*   **Clarity of Proofs:** While the convergence proofs are included in the appendix, they are quite dense and could benefit from more detailed explanations. Making the key steps and logical connections more explicit would improve readability.
*   **Limited Discussion of Limitations:** The paper could benefit from a more explicit discussion of the limitations of the DRCGD algorithm. For example, are there specific types of local functions or graph topologies for which the algorithm performs poorly? A more nuanced discussion of when and where DRCGD is most applicable would strengthen the paper.
*   **Impact of 't' on Convergence Rate:** Although the paper mentions varying communication rounds `t` in the experiments, the convergence analysis should include a discussion of how `t` affects the proven convergence rate. What are the practical considerations in choosing an appropriate value for `t`?
*   **Reproducibility:** Providing code or more details about the implementation (e.g., parameter tuning strategies) would enhance the reproducibility of the results.

Overall, this is a promising paper that introduces a potentially valuable algorithm for decentralized Riemannian optimization. Addressing the points raised above, particularly concerning the extended assumption and the clarity of the proofs, would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact.
