OUTPUT:
Following Adkins et al. (2023), this paper tackles the challenging problem of understanding how large language models (LLMs) implement chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. The paper proposes a novel framework based on path patching and causal intervention to identify key attention heads responsible for CoT reasoning in LLMs. The approach focuses on constructing appropriate counterfactual examples paired with a "word-of-interest" (WoI) normalization technique to overcome challenges related to the complexity of reasoning and the sparsity of causal effects.

**Strengths:**

*   **Important Problem:** Understanding the inner workings of CoT reasoning in LLMs is crucial for improving their reliability, trustworthiness, and explainability. This work addresses a significant gap in the current literature.
*   **Novel Approach:** The proposed framework, combining in-context learning for RE/CE generation and WoI normalization, is innovative and specifically tailored to address the difficulties associated with interpreting CoT reasoning in LLMs. The WoI normalization is a key contribution, providing a method to focus on relevant output tokens.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The paper presents extensive experiments on multiple datasets (StrategyQA, AQuA, CSQA) and LLMs (LLaMA2-7B, Qwen-7B), providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
*   **Interesting Findings:** The paper identifies specific attention heads that play critical roles in CoT reasoning, highlighting their distribution across layers and their attention patterns towards relevant tokens. The observation that some heads are responsible for judging the final answer while others synthesize the step-by-step thoughts is insightful.
*   **Ablation Studies:** The analysis of different CE templates and metrics demonstrates the robustness of the proposed framework and provides valuable insights into the design choices.
*   **Well-written and organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, with a clear presentation of the methodology, experiments, and results. The figures and tables are helpful in visualizing the findings.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Scope of CE Construction:** While the paper explores different CE templates, the CE construction still relies heavily on replacing the rationale with irrelevant sentences. The specific mechanism that turns off the reasoning capacity is therefore not well explored. What are the exact properties that makes a passage stop the models from reasoning? Further investigation here would be beneficial.
*   **Choice of LLMs:** The paper focuses on LLaMA2-7B and Qwen-7B. While these are popular models, it would be valuable to investigate the generalizability of the findings to other LLM architectures and scales. It would be worthwhile to consider larger models with more complex reasoning capabilities.
*   **Explanation of Attention Heads:** While the paper identifies key attention heads and provides some analysis of their attention patterns, a deeper understanding of *why* these specific heads are important for CoT reasoning is needed. What specific computations or knowledge are these heads encoding? Can we derive more specific descriptions of the capabilities of these attention heads?
*   **Knockout Method:** The knockout experiments involve replacing the attention head outputs with those from the CE. While this is a common approach, it might not be the most faithful way to simulate the absence of the head. Using an average activation value (as mentioned in the background) or other intervention techniques might provide more reliable results.
*   **Lack of Comparison with Baselines:** The paper lacks a direct comparison with other interpretability methods for LLMs. While path patching is a well-established technique, it would be beneficial to compare the results with other approaches, such as attention analysis or probing, to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Investigate CE Construction More Deeply:** Experiment with more sophisticated methods for constructing CEs that target specific aspects of the reasoning process. For example, manipulate the numerical computation or logical reasoning components of the CoT example.
*   **Expand LLM Experiments:** Consider including other LLM architectures and scales in the experiments to assess the generalizability of the findings.
*   **Deeper Analysis of Attention Head Functionality:** Provide a more in-depth analysis of the computational role of the identified attention heads, drawing connections to specific knowledge or reasoning mechanisms. Consider analyzing the input embeddings that activate these specific heads.
*   **Refine Knockout Method:** Explore alternative knockout techniques, such as using average activation values or other more sophisticated intervention strategies.
*   **Compare with Existing Methods:** Include a comparison with other interpretability methods for LLMs to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed framework.
*   **Address Limitations of WoI normalization:** WoI normalization appears quite specific to question-answering formats. Consider how it could be adapted for more generative tasks.
*   **Discuss Limitations:** The paper would benefit from a dedicated section discussing the limitations of the proposed approach and potential directions for future research.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of LLM interpretability. The proposed framework is novel, the experiments are thorough, and the findings are insightful. While there are some limitations, the paper offers a strong foundation for future research on understanding the inner workings of CoT reasoning in LLMs. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the weaknesses and suggestions outlined above.
