OUTPUT:
Following Browder et al. (2019), this paper investigates the computational hardness of learning equivariant neural networks via gradient descent, specifically within the correlational statistical query (CSQ) framework. The central question is whether the inductive bias imparted by symmetry is sufficient to overcome the known exponential complexity of learning general shallow neural networks. The paper answers this question negatively, providing lower bounds for several equivariant architectures including graph neural networks (GNNs), convolutional networks (CNNs), invariant polynomials, and frame-averaged networks.

**Strengths:**

*   **Important and Timely Question:** The work addresses a fundamental question regarding the interplay between symmetry and computational complexity in machine learning. With the increasing use of equivariant networks, understanding their theoretical limitations is crucial.
*   **Breadth of Results:** The paper presents a variety of lower bounds spanning several important equivariant architectures. This provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges in learning these models.
*   **Solid Theoretical Foundation:** The proofs are based on extensions of existing techniques from learning theory, particularly the CSQ framework and the hardness results for non-symmetric networks.
*   **Clear Motivation and Presentation:** The introduction clearly motivates the research question and places the work within the relevant literature. The paper is generally well-written and organized.
*   **Complementary Results:** The inclusion of efficient learning algorithms for sparse invariant polynomials (albeit not via gradient descent) and an NP-hardness result for GNN training provides a more complete picture of the landscape.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The experimental results, while limited, provide empirical evidence supporting the theoretical lower bounds. The experiments convincingly demonstrate the difficulty in learning functions from the proposed hard classes using standard training procedures.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Scope of Experiments:** The experiments could be expanded to include a wider range of datasets, network architectures, and training techniques. A more detailed analysis of the factors affecting learnability in practice would be valuable.
*   **Dependence on Existing Hardness Results:** The proofs largely rely on extending existing hardness results for non-symmetric networks. While this is a valid approach, it would be interesting to see if novel proof techniques could lead to stronger lower bounds or new insights.
*   **Worst-Case Nature of Results:** The CSQ framework provides worst-case lower bounds. It would be useful to explore average-case hardness or identify specific properties of the data distribution that make learning more or less difficult. The paper lacks any attempt to discuss specific data distributions that could allow for easier learning or be more common in real-world problems.
*   **Practical Relevance of Hard Function Classes:** It's not entirely clear how closely the proposed hard function classes reflect real-world functions that equivariant networks are typically used to learn. Further discussion of the relevance and applicability of these function classes would strengthen the paper.
*   **Lack of Comparative Analysis to other Hardness Classes:** The paper would greatly benefit from a discussion relating its hardness class functions to pre-existing hardness classes in a range of related papers.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand the experiments:** Include more diverse datasets, architectures, and training techniques.
*   **Investigate average-case hardness:** Explore the potential for efficient learning under specific data distributions.
*   **Discuss the limitations of the CSQ framework:** Acknowledge the worst-case nature of the results and discuss potential alternative frameworks for analyzing the computational complexity of learning.
*   **Further explore implicit biases:** The paper touches upon implicit bias in relation to existing work. Exploring how implicit biases can mitigate the demonstrated hardness would be a valuable addition.
*   **Incorporate a discussion of the limitations of the negative results.** In particular, it would be useful to relate the paper's hardness class functions to existing hardness class functions.

**Overall:**

This is a valuable theoretical contribution to the field of equivariant machine learning. The paper provides important insights into the computational limitations of learning equivariant networks via gradient descent. While the worst-case nature of the results and the limited scope of the experiments warrant some caution, the paper is a significant step forward in understanding the fundamental challenges in this area. The paper warrants publication in ICLR.
