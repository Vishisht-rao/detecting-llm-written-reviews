OUTPUT:
Following Crippen et al. (2023), this paper investigates the application of decoder-only large language models (LLMs) to the task of simultaneous machine translation (SiMT). The core idea is to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM, specifically LLaMA-2, to generate a special "wait" token, effectively controlling input segmentation and enabling SiMT without a separate policy network. The paper presents results for English-German and English-Russian language pairs, demonstrating comparable BLEU scores to state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, it explores the zero-shot capabilities of closed-source models like GPT-4, showing promising results.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Approach:** The paper presents a novel approach to SiMT by leveraging the capabilities of decoder-only LLMs. This is a significant departure from the traditional encoder-decoder architectures commonly used in SiMT. The "wait" token mechanism for policy-free translation is clever and potentially simplifies the system design.
*   **Clear and Well-Structured:** The paper is well-written and organized, clearly explaining the methodology, experimental setup, and results. The figures and tables are informative and contribute to the overall understanding of the approach.
*   **Strong Empirical Evaluation:** The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach, comparing it to several baselines and exploring different aspects of the system's performance (T2TT, S2TT, zero-shot). The ablation studies on the importance of "wait" tokens further strengthen the analysis.
*   **Reproducibility Considerations:** The authors explicitly discuss the hyperparameters used for fine-tuning and inference, increasing chances of reproducibility. The explicit references to open-source libraries also promote reproducibility.
*   **Analysis of Limitations:** The paper acknowledges the limitations of the approach, such as the impact of ASR errors and the reliance on a system message, and discusses potential future directions to address these issues. The wall time comparisons are particularly insightful.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Dataset Size:** The training dataset size (4000 sentences) seems relatively small for fine-tuning a large language model.  It raises concerns about potential overfitting, especially given the model size. The paper would benefit from an analysis of the impact of dataset size on performance. It might be worth experimenting with techniques like data augmentation or transfer learning from other translation datasets to address this.
*   **Lack of Detailed Latency Analysis:** While the paper mentions latency (through AL, LAAL etc) and ablates `k` values, a more detailed analysis of the latency distribution is needed. What is the *variance* in latency? Are there pathological cases with very high latency? Understanding this distribution would be valuable for practical deployment considerations. Also, a direct comparison of latency achieved by other state-of-the-art SiMT models would be appreciated.
*   **ASR Integration:** The ASR integration seems somewhat naive. While the authors acknowledge this and propose future improvements, the current approach of fixed audio windowing and discarding potentially clipped words could significantly impact the system's performance. Furthermore, the models being compared have very different methodologies for ASR, complicating comparisons. More standardization here would be useful.
*   **System Message Sensitivity:** The reliance on a system message, even for supervised fine-tuning, is a potential drawback.  The authors mention a performance impact, but it would be beneficial to see results without the system message entirely to quantify the effect.  The appendix indicates that removing it speeds up inference with no noticeable drop in quality, which makes the inclusion of system messages questionable in SFT scenarios.
*   **Ablation Study Specificity:** The ablation study on the `wait` token utility only investigates k <= 2 for GPT-4. Expanding this analysis to include higher k values, as well as other models, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the token's importance across different scenarios.
*   **Tokenizer Imbalance:** The point made regarding the tokenizer's efficiency favoring English is a valid concern but lacks empirical support within the paper. While true in general, quantifying this bias for the specific language pairs and model used would strengthen this argument.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Dataset Size Analysis:** Conduct experiments with varying training dataset sizes to assess the impact on performance and generalization.
*   **Detailed Latency Analysis:** Provide a more thorough analysis of latency, including distribution statistics and comparisons to other SiMT models.
*   **Improved ASR Integration:** Explore more advanced ASR integration techniques to minimize errors and improve the overall system performance.
*   **System Message Ablation:**  Present results of SFT models without the system message.
*   **Extended Ablation Study:** Expand the ablation study on "wait" tokens to include higher k values and other models.
*   **Tokenizer Efficiency Evaluation:** Quantify the tokenizer's efficiency bias for the specific language pairs used in the study.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of simultaneous machine translation by demonstrating the potential of decoder-only LLMs for this task. While some limitations exist, the clear presentation, strong empirical evaluation, and insightful analysis make this a promising work worthy of consideration for ICLR 2024. With some revisions addressing the weaknesses outlined above, the paper could be further strengthened. I recommend a conditional accept, pending these revisions.
