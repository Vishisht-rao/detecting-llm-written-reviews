OUTPUT:
Following Jaquez et al. (2019), this paper introduces NAISR, a 3D Neural Additive Model for Interpretable Shape Representation. The core idea is to represent individual shapes by deforming a shape atlas based on disentangled covariates. The authors argue that existing Deep Implicit Function (DIF) methods lack the ability to precisely represent shapes while capturing dependencies on individual covariates, which is crucial for scientific shape discovery. NAISR aims to fill this gap by combining the benefits of DIFs with an atlas-based deformation approach, making it deformable, disentangleable, evolvable, transferable, and interpretable.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The paper presents a novel approach to shape representation by combining DIFs with an atlas deformation model that explicitly accounts for covariates. This is a significant contribution to the field, particularly for applications in medical imaging and scientific discovery.
*   **Interpretability:** The method explicitly aims for interpretability by disentangling the effects of different covariates on shape. This is a desirable feature for scientific applications where understanding the influence of covariates is crucial. The neural additive model approach is well-motivated by GAMs and NAMs.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper provides a thorough evaluation of NAISR on three datasets: a synthetic 2D Starman dataset, the ADNI hippocampus 3D shape dataset, and a pediatric airway 3D shape dataset. The evaluation includes shape reconstruction, shape disentanglement, shape evolution, and shape transfer, demonstrating the versatility of the proposed method.
*   **Strong Results:** NAISR demonstrates excellent shape reconstruction performance while retaining interpretability. The quantitative results show superior performance compared to several baselines, especially in the ADNI hippocampus and pediatric airway datasets. Qualitative results support these findings. The shape transfer results are also promising.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is well-written and structured, with a clear explanation of the method and the experimental setup. The figures and tables are informative and easy to understand.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors provide detailed implementation details, ablation studies, and data processing steps in the supplementary material, enhancing the reproducibility of the work. The code is publicly available (a significant strength).

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Invertibility of Deformations:** The paper acknowledges that invertible transforms are often desirable for shape correspondences but not guaranteed in NAISR. While the authors mention a potential solution using velocity fields, they also note the associated computational cost. This could be a significant limitation in some applications where precise point correspondences are critical. More discussion on the implications of non-invertible deformations would be beneficial.
*   **Limited Assessment of Abnormality Detection:** The authors mention that they will include patients with airway abnormalities in future work to explore if the model of normal airway shape can be used to detect abnormalities. The current paper lacks any direct assessment of the model's ability to identify or characterize shape abnormalities, which is a key application in medical imaging.
*   **Potential Overfitting Concerns:** Although the authors addressed overfitting concerns related to A-SDF, it is important to ensure and explicitly state that NAISR does not overfit as more covariates are added. Even with the latent code regularizer and additive architecture, the potential for overfitting should still be discussed, particularly for complex shapes or datasets with a limited number of samples.
*   **Demographics for the airway data:** What is the ethnic distribution and the BMI?
*   **Starman Dataset limitations:** What is the relationship between the arms and legs?
*   **Choice of Atlas:** The method depends on an atlas shape T. Although the paper states that the method can create it, a discussion of the influence of the atlas on the final solution is absent. Could it be a problem that one atlas is not suitable for all cases?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address the Invertibility Issue:** Provide a more detailed discussion of the implications of non-invertible deformations and potential workarounds.
*   **Include Abnormality Detection Analysis:** If possible, include a preliminary analysis of the model's ability to detect or characterize shape abnormalities.
*   **Discuss Overfitting Mitigation:** Explicitly address potential overfitting concerns and discuss strategies to mitigate this risk, especially as the number of covariates increases.
*   **Elaborate on Future Work:** Expand the discussion of future work, including specific plans for addressing the limitations of the current approach.
*   **Minor issues:** What happens to the performance when there are more than 4 covariates?

**Overall:**

This paper presents a strong and novel approach to interpretable shape representation. NAISR has the potential to be a valuable tool for scientific shape discovery, particularly in medical imaging. The identified weaknesses are relatively minor and can be addressed in future work. The paper is well-written, the results are compelling, and the code is publicly available. I recommend acceptance.
