OUTPUT:
Following Nassar et al. (2016), this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of Optimal Transport (OT)-based Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The authors make a valuable contribution by unifying existing OT-based GAN approaches (WGAN, OTM, UOTM) under a single framework, enabling a systematic comparison and ablation study. Their analysis highlights the importance of strictly convex functions in the discriminator loss for stable training and the role of the cost function in mitigating mode collapse. Furthermore, the proposed UOTM with Scheduled Divergence (UOTM-SD) is a novel and effective method for improving the performance and robustness of UOTM by gradually aligning the generated distribution with the data distribution. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of UOTM-SD over existing OT-based GANs on CIFAR-10 and CelebA-HQ-256 datasets.

**Strengths:**

*   **Unified Framework:** The unification of different OT-based GANs into a single framework is a significant contribution. It allows for a clear and consistent analysis of the different components and their effects on training dynamics.
*   **Comprehensive Analysis:** The ablation study on the effect of different components (cost function, strictly convex functions in discriminator loss) provides valuable insights into the behavior of OT-based GANs. The explanation of the role of each component in training dynamics is well-supported by experimental results.
*   **Novel Method:** The proposed UOTM-SD is a simple yet effective method for improving the performance and robustness of UOTM. The intuition behind gradually up-weighting divergence terms is well-motivated.
*   **Strong Experimental Results:** The experimental results on CIFAR-10 and CelebA-HQ-256 demonstrate the effectiveness of UOTM-SD compared to existing OT-based GANs. The ablation study on the cost function intensity parameter shows the improved robustness of UOTM-SD.
*   **Theoretical Analysis:** The theoretical analysis, including Theorem 3.1 (equi-Lipschitz continuity of UOTM potential) and Theorem 4.1 (convergence of optimal transport plan), provides a solid foundation for the proposed method.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors provide detailed implementation details in the appendix and have submitted the source code, ensuring the reproducibility of the results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Scope of Analysis:** While the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the chosen OT-based GANs, it primarily focuses on the impact of the cost function and the strictly convex functions in the discriminator loss.  The authors acknowledge fixing g3=Id during the analysis and this is a significant limitation. A deeper dive into other components or regularizations could further enrich the analysis.
*   **Transport Map Convergence:** Theorem 4.1 proves the convergence of the transport *plan* but not the transport *map* itself. While the empirical results are compelling, a theoretical guarantee on the map convergence would be stronger. This is a key point for future research.
*   **Presentation Could be Improved:** The paper is generally well-written, but some sections could be reorganized for better clarity. For example, the sections on the effect of strictly convex functions and the cost function could be more tightly integrated.  The figures, while informative, could be larger and include more detailed captions.
*   **Minor Technicality in Theorem Assumption:** The assumption on the non-negativity of Ψi is confusing as it contradicts the sentence "Ψi(x) =∞forx < 0". This should be clarified.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand the Scope of Analysis:** Explore the impact of different choices for the generator loss function (g3) and other regularization techniques.
*   **Investigate Transport Map Convergence:** Provide theoretical or empirical evidence to support the convergence of the transport map in UOTM-SD.
*   **Refine Presentation:** Reorganize some sections for better flow and clarity. Increase the size and detail of the figures. Clarify the assumption about the non-negativity of the entropy functions.
*   **Discuss Limitations More Explicitly:** While the limitations are mentioned, a more explicit discussion of the assumptions and potential shortcomings of the approach would strengthen the paper.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of OT-based GANs. The unified framework, comprehensive analysis, and novel UOTM-SD method are valuable contributions. While there are some weaknesses, the strengths outweigh the limitations. I recommend this paper for acceptance at ICLR 2024.
