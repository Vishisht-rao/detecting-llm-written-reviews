OUTPUT:
Following Mcmullin et al. (2020), this paper explores unsupervised automatic speech recognition (ASR) by leveraging cross-lingual transfer learning. The core idea is to use a source language acoustic model (AM), trained on labeled data, to generate pseudo-labels for a target language with only unpaired audio and text. These pseudo-labels, constrained by a target language model (LM), are then used to bootstrap a target language AM. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach on Common Voice and LJSpeech datasets, showing promising results even when transferring between languages from different families and alphabets.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The paper addresses an important and practical problem: training ASR systems for low-resource languages where labeled data is scarce. The cross-lingual pseudo-labeling approach is intuitive and provides a viable alternative to purely unsupervised methods.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and clearly explains the proposed method, experimental setup, and results. The figures and tables effectively illustrate the key concepts and findings.
*   **Empirical Evaluation:** The authors present a comprehensive set of experiments across various language pairs and datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and provide valuable insights into the factors influencing cross-lingual transfer. The analysis of the impact of source and target language dataset sizes is particularly insightful.
*   **Simplicity:** The method avoids complex adversarial training, phonetic lexicons, or other sophisticated techniques, relying on standard ASR recipes and end-to-end character-level acoustic models. This makes the approach more accessible and easier to implement.
*   **Strong Results:** The reported results, especially the significant improvement over character-based wav2vec-U 2.0 on LJSpeech, are compelling.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors provide detailed training and evaluation details, increasing the potential for reproducibility.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Ablation Studies:** While the paper presents a good overview of their setup, the impact of certain design choices (e.g., specific architecture or hyperparameters) could be explored more deeply. A stronger ablation study would strengthen the conclusions.
*   **Language Dependence:** The success of cross-lingual transfer seems to be highly language-dependent, especially with french. The paper mentions difficulties with french. A deeper investigation into why this language transfers poorly would be beneficial. The limitations are acknowledged but could be more thoroughly addressed.
*   **Lack of a Comprehensive Comparison:** While the paper compares against wav2vec-U 2.0, a broader comparison with other relevant unsupervised or cross-lingual ASR methods would be valuable. Although the authors focus on character-based methods, acknowledging and briefly discussing phoneme-based or multilingual approaches in more detail would improve the context.
*   **Dependence on Target LM:** The method heavily relies on a good target language model (LM). The paper could discuss strategies for creating LMs for truly zero-resource languages where even text data is limited.
*   **Error Rates:** The error rates for some of the cross-lingual transfer tasks, while promising, are still relatively high. Further improvements are needed to make the approach practical for real-world applications.
*   **Czech Language Evaluation:** The authors pick Belarusian and Czech for cross-alphabet languages. The low number of hours (25h) for Czech seems like a weak evaluation. Perhaps evaluating on another lower-resource latin alphabet language would make the demonstration more impactful.
*   **Ethics and reproducibility**: The ethics statement is brief and doesn't deal with the potential for misuse, such as mass surveillance on low resource languages. While the reproducibility statement mentions publicly available data, it also could describe details on the computing infrastructure required for these experiments.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   Include ablation studies to analyze the impact of key components, such as architecture.
*   Investigate and address the reasons for poor transfer performance with French.
*   Compare with a wider range of baseline methods, including relevant multilingual or transfer learning approaches.
*   Discuss strategies for creating LMs for zero-resource languages.
*   Explore techniques for further reducing error rates.
*   Expand the ethics statement to address potential misuse.
*   Provide more detail on the computational resources required for the experiments in the reproducibility section.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of unsupervised ASR. The cross-lingual pseudo-labeling approach is promising, well-explained, and empirically supported. While there are some limitations and areas for improvement, the paper is worthy of acceptance at ICLR 2024, contingent on addressing the comments above.
