OUTPUT:
Following Rhyne et al. (2019), this paper proposes a novel method called Progressive Fourier Neural Representation (PFNR) for continual learning of neural implicit representations (NIR) for sequential video compilation. The core idea is to learn adaptive and compact sub-modules in the Fourier space for each video session, enabling continuous accumulation of high-quality representations while preserving previously learned information. This is achieved by freezing the weights of previously learned subnetworks and allowing overlapping subnetworks for knowledge transfer. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of PFNR on the UVG8/17 and DAVIS50 datasets, showing improved performance over continual learning baselines.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The paper introduces a novel approach to continual learning in NIR by leveraging Fourier space and the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis. The concept of Progressive Fourier Neural Representation seems promising.
*   **Clear Problem Definition:** The paper clearly defines the problem of continual learning for NIR in the context of sequential video encoding. The limitations of existing NIR methods are well explained.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The proposed PFNR method is well-motivated and technically sound. The Fourier Subnetwork Operator (FSO) and the joint training approach are clearly described.
*   **Strong Experimental Results:** The paper provides comprehensive experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the superiority of PFNR over strong baselines in terms of PSNR and MS-SSIM. The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of FSO.
*   **Forget-free Guarantee:** A key strength of the approach is the guarantee of no forgetting on previously learned videos, a significant advantage in continual learning scenarios.
*   **Code Availability:** The availability of the code is a plus, facilitating reproducibility and further research.
*   **Analysis:** The transfer matrix visualization is a nice addition, illustrating the relationships learned between different videos. The exploration of layer-wise representations provides some insights into the learned features.
* **Well-written:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Novelty in Architecture:** The paper relies on the existing NeRV architecture as a backbone. While the FSO is a novel component, the overall architecture's novelty is limited. A more significant architectural contribution could further enhance the paper's impact.
*   **Computational Cost of Decoding:** The decoding FPS is lower than NeRV, potentially limiting practical applications. While the paper acknowledges this, further investigation and optimization for decoding speed would be beneficial.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The choice of `c` (capacity ratio) and the FSO layer seem crucial. The ablation study helps, but a more systematic approach to hyperparameter tuning and analysis of their impact on performance could be stronger.
*   **Lack of Comparison with More Recent Continual Learning Techniques:** The field of continual learning is rapidly evolving. Comparing PFNR with more recent and advanced continual learning techniques, beyond the included baselines, would further strengthen the paper. Particularly, comparison with more recent architecture-based CL approaches would be beneficial.
*   **DAVIS50 Results:** The results on DAVIS50 are significantly lower than UVG8/17, suggesting potential limitations in scaling to larger and more complex datasets. The paper acknowledges this but doesn't provide a deeper analysis of the reasons for this performance degradation.
*   **Limited Qualitative Results:** While the paper presents quantitative results, more detailed qualitative analysis and comparisons (e.g., side-by-side visual comparisons with baselines, especially in the DAVIS50 setting where performance is lower) would provide a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of PFNR.
* **Ablation study is a bit incomplete**: It is great that the authors provide ablation studies. However, it is not entirely clear from table 11 and 12 if replacing conv with just the imaginary part, or just the real part, is beneficial. More variants of the ablation would be helpful for a complete view.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Architectural Exploration:** Investigate and experiment with alternative backbone architectures or modifications to the NeRV architecture to further improve performance and efficiency.
*   **Decoding Speed Optimization:** Explore techniques to optimize the decoding process and improve FPS, such as model pruning or quantization.
*   **Hyperparameter Analysis:** Conduct a more systematic analysis of the impact of hyperparameters, particularly `c` and the FSO layer, on performance and generalization.
*   **Comparison with State-of-the-Art CL Techniques:** Compare PFNR with more recent and advanced continual learning techniques, including those designed for image or video data.
*   **DAVIS50 Analysis:** Investigate the reasons for the performance degradation on DAVIS50 and propose potential solutions or modifications to PFNR to improve scalability.
*   **More Detailed Qualitative Analysis:** Provide more detailed qualitative results, including side-by-side visual comparisons with baselines, to better illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of PFNR.
*   **Discuss limitations more clearly:** The last item in the "Broader impact" section is not a "broader impact" (positive or negative) of the work, but a comment about misuse of deep learning in general. This should be removed and/or replaced by an actual discussion about the impact of the work.
*   **Improve writing in Appendix** The appendix has some strange formatting issues. For example, section A.1.3 is titled "Fourier Operator", but the following section A.1.4 is titled "Fourier Subneural Operator (FSO)" instead of "Fourier Subneural Operator". This suggests that the (FSO) part should be in the section header itself.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a novel and promising approach for continual learning of NIR in the context of sequential video compilation. The proposed PFNR method demonstrates strong performance on benchmark datasets and offers a significant advantage in terms of forget-free learning. While there are some limitations and areas for improvement, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field and has the potential to inspire further research in this area. I recommend this paper for acceptance, conditional on addressing the suggestions above.

**Rating:** 7 (Good paper, accept if a few things are fixed)
