OUTPUT:
Following Bollinger et al. (2021), this paper presents HAICO-CN, a novel approach to human-AI collaboration that aims to personalize models to individual user's noisy labeling patterns. The core idea involves clustering users based on their noisy label characteristics, augmenting training data with cluster-specific noise patterns, and then training personalized human-AI collaborative models for each cluster. During inference, a user goes through an onboarding process to be assigned to a cluster, and the corresponding model is used for joint decision-making.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The idea of personalizing human-AI collaboration models based on cluster-wise noisy label augmentation is novel and addresses a significant gap in existing research that often relies on global confusion matrices or human behavior models.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper presents a comprehensive evaluation across diverse datasets, including synthetic (CIFAR-10 simulation) and real-world multi-rater datasets (CIFAR-10N, CIFAR-10H, Fashion-MNIST-H, Chaoyang histopathology). The introduction of new evaluation criteria (Positive/Negative Alteration Rates) is valuable for assessing human-AI collaborative frameworks.
*   **Model-Agnostic:** The proposed HAICO-CN framework is model-agnostic, which makes it applicable to various base models. The authors empirically validated this by using different backbone architectures (ResNet, DenseNet, ViT).
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The experimental results consistently demonstrate HAICO-CN's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art human-AI collaboration methods. The ablation studies provide insights into the impact of different components of the framework.
*   **Clear and Well-Structured Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and structured, making it easy to follow the proposed methodology and experimental setup.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Onboarding Process:** The onboarding process requires each testing user to label 20 images per class which is a lot of work for the human experts. A more efficient, few-shot onboarding approach needs to be further explored.
*   **Assumption of Distinct Noise Patterns:** The method assumes distinct noise patterns across user groups. The paper needs to acknowledge the cases where users exhibits highly comparable noisy patterns and explore automated methods of determine the optimal number of clusters.
*   **Privacy Concerns:** The clustering process could potentially compromise user privacy by revealing individual noisy label patterns. The paper should address this limitation and discuss potential strategies to preserve user privacy during clustering.
*   **Limited Scope:** The current implementation focuses on multi-class classification tasks. Expanding the scope to multi-label scenarios would be a valuable extension.
*   **Synthetic Nature of some test sets:** While the use of crowd-sourced labels in CIFAR-10N and CIFAR-10H provide a more realistic assessment, the synthetic nature of test sets in Fashion-MNIST-H and Chaoyang is a limitation. It needs to be stated more clearly in the paper.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address Privacy Concerns:** Explicitly address the privacy implications of the user clustering process and propose potential solutions, such as differential privacy techniques.
*   **Improve Onboarding Efficiency:** Explore more efficient onboarding strategies that require fewer labeled examples from new users.
*   **Explore alternative to fuzzy K-means:** Investigate methods on determining a fundamental number of clusters like silhouette score plots on the training data.
*   **Expand to Multi-Label Scenarios:** Discuss the challenges and potential solutions for extending HAICO-CN to multi-label classification tasks.
*   **Investigate sensitivity to number of clusters:** Show the performance and impact of increasing or decreasing number of clusters.
*   **Discussion on limitations with synthetic data in Fashion-MNIST-H and Chaoyang datasets:** The impact of potential domain shift from having all test users artificially built through transition matrix.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a solid contribution to the field of human-AI collaboration. The proposed HAICO-CN framework is novel, well-evaluated, and demonstrates promising results. The weaknesses outlined above can be addressed to further strengthen the paper and enhance its impact. I recommend acceptance with the suggested revisions.
