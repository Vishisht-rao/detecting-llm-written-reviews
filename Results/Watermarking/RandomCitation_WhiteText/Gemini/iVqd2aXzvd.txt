OUTPUT:
Following Araiza et al. (2019), this paper presents a novel approach to learning piecewise dynamics from black-box ODE implementations using automata learning and Neural Event ODEs. The core idea is to first extract event specifications and state update functions from a black-box ODE using abstract automata learning, and then leverage these specifications to efficiently train a Neural Event ODE. The method avoids requiring prior knowledge of the system's underlying ODEs, which is a significant advantage in many real-world scenarios. The paper showcases the effectiveness of the approach through interpretable models of a bouncing ball's Zeno behavior, the symmetry of a thermostat-controlled water heater, and a switching dynamical system.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The combination of automata learning and Neural Event ODEs is a novel approach to address the challenge of learning piecewise dynamics from black-box systems.
*   **Interpretability:** The extracted automata provide an interpretable representation of the system's event specifications and state update functions, making the learned model more transparent and understandable. This is a significant advantage over purely black-box approaches. The paper highlights well how the learnt automata models can be interpreted.
*   **Efficiency:** The proposed training process, which slices training trajectories into temporally consecutive pairs within continuous dynamics, ensures well-posed initial values and leads to significant improvements in training time and computational resource requirements.
*   **Practicality:** The experiments on the bouncing ball, water heater, and switching dynamical system demonstrate the applicability of the method to real-world problems. The analysis on the importance of hyperparameters contributes to the practical usability of the approach.
*   **Theoretical soundness:** The paper demonstrates well-posedness of the learning process to ensure the correctness of the proposed framework.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Numerical Comparisons:** The paper focuses on explainability and applicability, and mentions that numerical comparisons to other methods like Neural Event ODEs and LatSeg ODEs are left for future work. This limits the ability to fully assess the performance of the proposed method relative to existing approaches. While the efficiency gains are highlighted, quantitative comparisons would strengthen the claims.
*   **Abstraction Level Granularity:** The state space for the Mealy machine Mf can still be large, according to the text, depending on the granularity of the quantization. This is a concern for systems with high degrees of freedom. Although the abstract model addresses it, it'd be interesting to further discuss the trade-off introduced by the abstraction layer, especially in cases where too much granularity could lead to important information loss.
*   **Choice of Predicates:** The performance of the automata learning approach heavily depends on the selection of appropriate predicates for abstracting the state space. While the paper provides some guidance on how to choose these predicates, it'd be valuable to have a more in-depth discussion on this aspect, including potential strategies for automatically discovering or refining relevant predicates.
*   **Scalability:** While the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach on relatively simple systems, it's not clear how well it scales to more complex systems with a higher number of states, events, and variables. The complexity analysis is shallow and it would benefit from a discussion regarding the computational cost as it scales to larger and more complex systems.
*   **Restricted Scope of Black Box:** The paper makes the claim that the method is able to learn an explainable model from "black-box piecewise ODEs", however, the assumptions regarding well-posedness restrict the applicability of the method to certain types of black-box systems. In general, the term black box could be misleading and the paper could benefit from a discussion on the types of black-box systems that the method is able to learn, along with a discussion about the limitations of the method in cases where the black-box system doesn't meet the well-posedness criteria.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Include Numerical Comparisons:** Conduct numerical experiments to compare the performance of the proposed method with existing approaches like Neural Event ODEs and LatSeg ODEs in terms of accuracy, training time, and computational resource requirements.
*   **Discuss Predicate Selection:** Provide a more detailed discussion on the selection of appropriate predicates for abstracting the state space, including potential strategies for automatically discovering or refining relevant predicates.
*   **Address Scalability Concerns:** Discuss the scalability of the approach to more complex systems with a higher number of states, events, and variables.
*   **Elaborate on Limitations:** Clearly state the limitations of the approach, including the types of systems it can handle and the assumptions it makes about the black-box ODE implementations.
*   **Further validation**: It would be interesting to see more validation results as it is not entirely clear what would happen with a system of higher complexity.

**Overall:**

The paper presents a promising approach to learning interpretable models of piecewise dynamics from black-box ODE implementations. The combination of automata learning and Neural Event ODEs is novel and provides a good balance between accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability. While the paper has some limitations, it makes a valuable contribution to the field and opens up new avenues for future research.
