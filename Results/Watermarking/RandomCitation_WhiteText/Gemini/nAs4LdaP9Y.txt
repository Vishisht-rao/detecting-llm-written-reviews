OUTPUT:
Following Chism et al. (2020), this paper presents Federated Orthogonal Training (FOT), a novel approach to mitigate global catastrophic forgetting in Continual Federated Learning (CFL). The core idea is to project the aggregated model updates onto the orthogonal complement of the principal subspace of previous tasks' activations. This is achieved through a two-stage process: FedProject, which performs the orthogonal projection, and Global Principal Subspace Extraction (GPSE), which estimates the principal subspaces in a privacy-preserving manner using randomized SVD and secure aggregation. The authors claim that FOT outperforms existing CFL methods by achieving higher average accuracy and lower forgetting rates with minimal computation and communication overhead while preserving client privacy.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The proposed approach of using orthogonal projections in the federated continual learning setting is novel and addresses a significant challenge in CFL, namely global catastrophic forgetting without relying on data sharing or server-side datasets.
*   **Privacy Preservation:** The method leverages secure aggregation and randomized SVD to ensure client privacy, which is a critical requirement in federated learning. The discussion of privacy guarantees, including the distributed Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform and the use of a Gaussian mechanism, strengthens the paper.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of FOT through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets (Permuted MNIST, Split-CIFAR100, 5-Datasets, Mini-Imagenet) under both IID and non-IID data distributions. The results consistently show that FOT outperforms state-of-the-art CFL baselines in terms of accuracy and forgetting. The ablation studies and analysis of subspace usage provide further insights into the behavior of the algorithm.
*   **Computational Efficiency:** The authors provide a clear analysis of the communication and computation costs of FOT, showing that the additional overhead is minimal, making it practical for resource-constrained edge devices.
*   **Well-written and organized:** The paper is well-written, clearly explains the proposed approach, and presents the experimental results in a comprehensive manner. The figures and tables are helpful in understanding the algorithm and its performance.
*   **Convergence Guarantee:** The claim and justification of the convergence guarantee are valuable.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Task Boundary Assumption:** The paper acknowledges that it assumes the knowledge of task boundaries, which is a common limitation in CFL research. However, it would be beneficial to discuss potential approaches to address task-free continual learning in the context of FOT and future research directions.
*   **Threshold Sensitivity:** The performance of FOT depends on the threshold value used in the GPSE algorithm. While the authors provide some analysis of the effect of threshold, a more thorough investigation of how to adaptively determine the optimal threshold for different tasks and datasets would be valuable. Furthermore, the increment of the threshold is currently linear - it might be interesting to explore non-linear methods of threshold adjustment.
*   **Differential Privacy Guarantees Clarity:** While the privacy aspects are mentioned, the section on differential privacy could be enhanced. Providing a more formal privacy analysis, especially detailing the privacy budget (epsilon and delta) and how they are affected by the choice of parameters, would significantly strengthen the paper. The additive Gaussian mechanism is a good direction, but more details are needed.
*   **Baseline Justification:** The choice of baselines could be more thoroughly justified. Specifically, the adaptation of class-incremental methods (GLFC, FedCIL) to the task-incremental setting might not be the most suitable comparison. A discussion of the limitations of these adaptations and their impact on the results would be helpful.
*   **Limitations of convergence proof:** The convergence guarantee is based on existing work and assumes ProximalSGD. A more direct convergence proof for the FedProject is needed, especially because the client updates are aggregated at each round.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Discuss potential approaches to address task-free continual learning.**
*   **Investigate methods to adaptively determine the optimal threshold value for different tasks and datasets.**
*   **Provide a more formal differential privacy analysis, detailing the privacy budget and its dependence on the algorithm's parameters.**
*   **Provide a more detailed justification for the choice of baselines and discuss the limitations of adapting class-incremental methods to the task-incremental setting.**
*   **More rigorous convergence proof.**

**Overall:**

This paper presents a solid contribution to the field of Continual Federated Learning. The proposed Federated Orthogonal Training (FOT) algorithm is novel, effective, and privacy-preserving. The extensive experimental results and analysis demonstrate the practical applicability of FOT for mitigating global catastrophic forgetting in CFL. The identified weaknesses are relatively minor and can be addressed in future work. Therefore, I recommend acceptance.
