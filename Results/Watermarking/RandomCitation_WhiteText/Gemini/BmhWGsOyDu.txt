OUTPUT:
Following Klink et al. (2017), this paper tackles a challenging and relatively underexplored area of reinforcement learning: controlling large-scale, potentially continuous, populations of agents. The paper proposes a novel approach based on formulating the problem as control of a deterministic dynamical system on a function space, using a moment transform to obtain a kernel representation, and developing a hierarchical RL algorithm.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Problem Formulation:** The paper addresses a significant gap in RL research by providing a systematic formulation for controlling large populations of agents. The framing of the agent population as a group system defined on function spaces is a strong theoretical contribution.
*   **Moment Kernel Representation:** The introduction of a moment transform and subsequent kernel representation appears to be a promising technique for reducing the dimensionality of the problem.
*   **Hierarchical Algorithm:** The hierarchical algorithm leverages the moment representation effectively. The optimality-preserving property of the hierarchy is a desirable feature, leading to faster convergence.
*   **Theoretical Guarantee:** The theoretical convergence guarantee for the algorithm is a significant strength, providing confidence in the algorithm's performance.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The LQR example provides a concrete illustration of the algorithm's applicability and effectiveness. The comparison with a standard sampling-based RL approach highlights the advantages of the proposed method, showing divergence of the vanilla RL approach.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper's writing could be improved. Some sections are dense and difficult to follow, particularly in the theoretical development. Improved clarity would significantly enhance the paper's accessibility. For example, the relation to existing moment problems, and the choice of kernel needs clarification.
*   **Limited Empirical Evaluation:** While the LQR example is useful, it is a relatively simple problem. More complex and diverse experiments would strengthen the paper's empirical validation. It is unclear to what extent these results generalize beyond LQR control. The paper's assumptions in a more general setting also are unclear.
*   **Practical Considerations:** The paper acknowledges that a sufficient amount of data is required to estimate the moments accurately. However, it lacks a discussion of how to obtain these data in real-world scenarios and how sensitive the algorithm is to moment estimation errors.
*   **Assumptions and Limitations:** The paper relies on several assumptions (S1, S2, C1, C2). The implications of these assumptions and their applicability to different problem domains should be discussed in more detail. The limitations section is too brief. The paper assumes a deterministic dynamical system. It is worth discussing how this framework could be extended to handle stochastic agent dynamics.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Improve Clarity:** Revise the writing to improve clarity and readability. Provide more intuition behind the theoretical concepts. Break down complex derivations into smaller steps with explanations.
*   **Expand Empirical Evaluation:** Conduct more extensive experiments on a wider range of problems. Compare the algorithm's performance with other relevant RL techniques for controlling large populations. Investigate the algorithm's sensitivity to various parameters and initial conditions.
*   **Discuss Practical Considerations:** Elaborate on the practical challenges of moment estimation and data acquisition. Analyze the algorithm's robustness to noise and errors in the moment representation.
*   **Address Assumptions and Limitations:** Provide a more thorough discussion of the assumptions and limitations of the proposed framework. Explore potential extensions to handle stochastic dynamics and other complexities.
*   **Clarify Kernel Choice:** What is the motivation behind choosing Chebychev polynomials? Are there any advantages, and if so how do these contribute to the system's ability to handle the group system's dimensionality?

**Overall Assessment:**

The paper presents a novel and theoretically sound approach to a challenging problem in reinforcement learning. The proposed algorithm has the potential to significantly advance the field by enabling the control of large-scale populations of agents. However, the paper's clarity, empirical evaluation, and discussion of practical considerations need to be improved. With these revisions, the paper would be a strong contribution to the ICLR conference.

**Recommendation:**

**Reject** pending major revisions. The paper has high potential but needs significant work to improve its clarity, empirical validation, and practical relevance.
