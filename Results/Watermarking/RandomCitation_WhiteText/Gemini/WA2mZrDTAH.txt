OUTPUT:
Following Haynie et al. (2020), this paper presents ZegOT, a novel framework for zero-shot semantic segmentation. The core idea is to leverage optimal transport (OT) to align multiple text prompts with pixel embeddings from a frozen CLIP model. A key component is the Multiple Prompt Optimal Transport Solver (MPOT), which aims to diversify the learned knowledge from text prompts, enabling the model to better handle unseen categories. The authors conduct experiments on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing zero-shot segmentation methods.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The application of optimal transport for aligning text prompts and pixel embeddings in zero-shot semantic segmentation is a novel approach. The MPOT module appears to be a well-designed component that addresses the issue of prompt convergence.
*   **Performance:** The experimental results on PAS20 and PC-59 are compelling, showcasing state-of-the-art performance. The cross-domain generalization results are also promising.
*   **Thorough Experiments and Ablation Studies:** The paper provides extensive experimental results and ablation studies, which help to understand the contribution of each component and hyperparameter. The ablation studies on learnable modules and matching methods are particularly insightful.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The figures and tables are helpful in understanding the proposed method.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors state that they will release the source code, which is crucial for reproducibility. The detailed descriptions of hyperparameters and algorithms also contribute to reproducibility.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Novelty in Overall Architecture:** While the MPOT is novel, the overall architecture still relies on a frozen CLIP model and a decoder, similar to existing methods. The main contribution appears to be the MPOT module. This needs to be clearly emphasized.
*   **Incomplete description of the training process**. More details should be added to the pseudo-code (Algorithm 2).
*   **Justification of Geometric Mean:** The choice of the geometric mean for combining refined score maps in Equation (8) could benefit from further justification or comparison with other aggregation methods (e.g., arithmetic mean, learned weights).
*   **Scalability concerns.** The limitation section notes scalability as a future study item, but the impact should be briefly mentioned in the introduction.
*   **Transductive Setting:** The paper states that the training is done under a transductive setting. This should be stated more explicitly in the introduction. While performing well, this is a weaker setup since there is an unfair advantage over other ZS3 methods.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Emphasize MPOT's novelty**. Refine the introduction to make it clearer that MPOT is the main contribution, and that other components have already been used in literature.
*   **Elaborate on Geometric Mean:** Provide further justification for the use of the geometric mean in Equation (8). Consider comparing its performance with other aggregation methods.
*   **Algorithm 2:** Add explanations regarding ZegOT model, parameters Î˜, AdamW model parameter update.
*   **Discussion of Trade-offs:** While MPOT improves performance, it comes at a cost. The discussion should be included in the conclusion as well.
*   **Inductive experiment.** It would be nice to see more inductive experiments in the main paper, rather than the supplemental materials. This may give a more complete picture of the quality of the approach.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a solid contribution to the field of zero-shot semantic segmentation. The ZegOT framework, particularly the MPOT module, demonstrates promising results. The paper is well-written and the experiments are thorough. Addressing the minor weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper.

I recommend this paper for acceptance, contingent on addressing the comments above.
