OUTPUT:
Following Orton et al. (2016), this paper tackles the important problem of data reduction for clustering in the presence of noisy data. The motivation is well-articulated, drawing from scenarios where noise arises from measurement errors, privacy-preserving techniques, or robustness considerations. The paper identifies a key limitation of existing coreset error measures when applied to noisy data: the traditional metric Err(S) can be overly sensitive to noise, failing to accurately reflect the quality of the optimal clustering solution obtainable from the noisy data.

To address this, the authors propose a novel coreset performance measure, ErrAR(S), based on approximation ratios. This new measure focuses on the ratio of costs for a given center set relative to the minimum cost over approximately optimal center sets. This approach aims to provide a more refined estimate of the quality of the optimal center set derived from the coreset in the presence of noise.

The contributions of the paper are significant. They include:

*   **A new coreset performance measure ErrAR(S):** This is the central contribution, offering a potentially more robust way to evaluate coresets in noisy settings.
*   **Theoretical analysis of ErrAR(S):** The paper provides quantitative bounds on the performance of coresets using this new measure, linking it to the noise level, input parameters, and optimal clustering cost. The theoretical results highlight a separation between Err(S) and ErrAR(S), demonstrating the advantages of the new measure.
*   **Empirical validation:** The authors present experimental results on real-world datasets (Adult and Bank) with additive Gaussian and Laplace noise. These results support the theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical benefits of using ErrAR(S).
*   **Guidance for Coreset Selection:** The paper offers guidance for coreset size selection in noisy data scenarios.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Importance:** The paper addresses a relevant and timely problem in the field of clustering.
*   **Novelty:** The proposed ErrAR(S) measure is a novel contribution that addresses a key limitation of existing methods.
*   **Theoretical Rigor:** The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed measure, with clear statements of assumptions and results.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The experimental results provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed measure.
*   **Clarity of Writing:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, though some of the technical sections are quite dense.
*   **Completeness:** The paper contains sufficient background, related work, and experimental details to allow for a comprehensive understanding of the contributions.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Assumptions on Data:** The theoretical results rely on Assumptions 1 and 2, which may not hold in all real-world datasets. While the authors acknowledge this limitation, it is a significant restriction on the applicability of the theoretical analysis.
*   **Technical Density:** While the paper is generally well-written, the proofs and some of the technical sections can be challenging to follow for readers who are not experts in coreset theory. More intuitive explanations alongside the formal proofs would improve readability.
*   **Limitations of Empirical Evaluation:** While the empirical results are promising, the evaluation could be strengthened by: a) using more diverse datasets, and b) exploring a wider range of clustering algorithms beyond k-means. Specifically, how the noise affects the clustering and how the coreset method impacts the result should be studied for complex data with less clear clusters.
*   **Lack of Algorithmic Contribution:** The paper primarily focuses on analysis rather than algorithm development. While the theoretical results can inform the design of new algorithms, the paper does not provide any concrete algorithmic contributions.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address Data Assumptions:** The authors should investigate the robustness of their results to violations of Assumptions 1 and 2. Perhaps a relaxation of these assumptions could be explored.
*   **Improve Readability:** The technical sections could be made more accessible by providing more intuitive explanations and examples.
*   **Expand Empirical Evaluation:** The empirical evaluation could be strengthened by using more diverse datasets and clustering algorithms. A study of the behaviour with more complex types of noises would also be a plus.
*   **Discuss Algorithmic Implications:** The authors should discuss the algorithmic implications of their theoretical results and suggest potential directions for future research in this area. It would be beneficial to propose a new coreset construction algorithm that leverages the ErrAR(S) metric.
*   **Related Work:** The related work could benefit from including recent work regarding the fairness of coresets.

**Overall Assessment:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of data reduction for clustering in the presence of noisy data. The proposed ErrAR(S) measure is a novel and potentially more robust way to evaluate coresets in noisy settings. The theoretical analysis is thorough and the empirical results provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed measure. While the paper has some limitations, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, and I recommend acceptance contingent on addressing the suggestions for improvement.
