OUTPUT:
Following Hurlburt et al. (2016), this paper presents a novel point-supervised contrastive variance method (PSCV) for medical image semantic segmentation, aiming to alleviate the burden of dense annotations by requiring only one pixel-point annotation per organ category. The core idea revolves around a contrastive variance (CV) loss, designed to exploit unlabeled pixels by leveraging the statistical spatial distribution properties of organs and their variance distribution map representations. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed method on two standard medical image datasets, showing improvements over state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The proposed PSCV method, particularly the CV loss, appears to be a novel approach to point-supervised medical image segmentation. The idea of using a contrastive loss on pixel-level variance distribution maps to exploit spatial distribution properties is interesting and potentially impactful.
*   **Problem Significance:** The paper addresses a significant problem in medical image analysis: the high cost and time associated with dense annotations. Weakly supervised learning is crucial for the broader applicability of medical image segmentation.
*   **Strong Experimental Results:** The experimental results on two datasets (Synapse and ACDC) are compelling. The PSCV consistently outperforms existing weakly supervised methods, and in some cases, gets close to the performance of fully supervised models. The ablation study effectively demonstrates the contribution of the CV loss.
*   **Clear Writing (mostly):** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, especially the introduction and method sections. The motivation for the approach and the technical details are reasonably explained.
*   **Well-Structured:** The paper follows a standard conference paper structure with a clear introduction, related work, methods, experiments, and conclusion.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity in CV Loss Explanation:** While the *idea* of the CV loss is clear, the *implementation details* could be described more explicitly. For example, the explanation of how negative samples are selected for the contrastive loss (across images and classes) could be written more clearly. The rationale behind certain design choices, like using the cosine similarity on variance maps rather than directly on features, could also be discussed in more detail.
*   **Comparison Method Selection:** While the comparison includes several relevant weakly supervised methods, the choice of methods for comparison could be strengthened. Including more recent or more specifically tailored weakly supervised medical image segmentation methods would further bolster the paper's contribution.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The hyperparameter analysis is limited to only two parameters. A more thorough analysis of the other hyperparameters used in training could be conducted. Also, the paper mentions central bias theory to refine the synpase dataset, but this does not seem appropriate. Justification is needed for such refinement.
*   **Missing Visual Comparison to Fully Supervised:** A direct visual comparison of the segmentation results of PSCV and the fully supervised method would be very insightful. This would allow reviewers to visually assess the remaining gap in performance.
*   **Lack of Justification for Certain Design Choices:** The paper mentions that central bias theory is used to filter fifty pixels that are close to left and right edges of prediction as background. The justication for such refining is missing.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Clarify CV Loss Implementation:** Provide a more detailed algorithmic description of the CV loss calculation, including sample selection. Justify the design decisions (e.g., why variance maps and cosine similarity).
*   **Strengthen Comparison:** Add comparison to more recent weakly supervised methods specifically designed for medical image segmentation. Justify the choice of baseline methods.
*   **Expand Hyperparameter Analysis:** Conduct a more comprehensive hyperparameter sensitivity study, or at least justify the selection of specific values for key parameters. Remove the implementation of central bias or justify the choice.
*   **Add Visual Comparison to Fully Supervised:** Include a figure comparing the visual segmentation results of PSCV with the fully supervised baseline.
*   **Proofread Carefully:** The paper contains some minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. A careful proofread is recommended.

**Overall Score:**

I am inclined to give this paper a **6 (Marginally above average)**. The proposed method is novel and the experimental results are strong. However, the clarity of the CV loss explanation and the strength of the comparison could be improved. Addressing these weaknesses would significantly strengthen the paper.
