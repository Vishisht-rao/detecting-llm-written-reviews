OUTPUT:
Following Shoaf et al. (2019), this paper introduces Skills-in-Context (SKiC) prompting, a novel prompting strategy for large language models (LLMs) aimed at improving compositional generalization. The central idea is to provide the LLM with both basic skills and examples of how to compose these skills to solve more complex problems. The authors argue this approach encourages the LLM to ground its reasoning steps in these basic skills, leading to better generalization to unseen, harder problems. The paper presents compelling experimental results across a range of challenging compositional tasks, demonstrating significant performance improvements compared to existing prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Least-to-Most (LtM), and Decomposed prompting. A key finding is that SKiC can unlock latent skills pre-existing in LLMs' internal knowledge acquired during pre-training, enabling them to solve complex reasoning problems even when those skills aren't explicitly provided in the prompt.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The SKiC prompting strategy is a novel and potentially impactful approach to improving compositional generalization in LLMs. The emphasis on grounding reasoning steps in explicitly defined skills distinguishes it from existing methods.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The paper provides extensive experimental results across a diverse set of tasks, including symbolic manipulation, arithmetic operations, question answering, dynamic programming, and mathematical reasoning. The improvements achieved by SKiC are substantial and consistently outperform existing prompting methods.
*   **Insightful Analysis:** The paper offers valuable insights into the mechanisms by which SKiC works. The demonstration of "internal skill activation" is particularly intriguing, suggesting that SKiC can leverage LLMs' pre-existing knowledge in creative ways.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is clearly written and well-organized, making it easy to follow the authors' reasoning and understand the proposed method. The figures and tables are informative and contribute to the overall clarity of the paper.
*   **Ablation and Error Analysis:** The ablation studies (different sources of skills) and the error analysis offer valuable insights into the effectiveness and limitations of the proposed method. This adds depth to the study.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Skill Distillation Process:** While the paper outlines two approaches for distilling skills (manual and LLM-assisted), it lacks a detailed discussion of the practical challenges involved in the skill distillation process. How to choose the right skills, how to represent them effectively, and how to ensure their quality are critical aspects that deserve more attention. The examples provided in the appendix help, but a more systematic discussion would be beneficial.
*   **Scalability of Manual Skill Distillation:** The manual skill distillation approach might not scale well to tasks requiring a very large number of diverse skills. The authors could discuss the limitations of manual distillation and explore alternative methods for automatically identifying and representing relevant skills.
*   **Dependency on High-Quality Foundation Models:** The effectiveness of SKiC likely depends on the quality of the underlying LLM and its pre-existing knowledge. The paper does not adequately address how SKiC might perform with less capable LLMs. Further investigation would be beneficial in determining the broader applicability of SKiC.
*   **Generalization Claims:** Although the paper showcases strong generalization results, the definition of "compositional generalization" is not rigorously formalized. This makes it slightly harder to compare against the vast literature that is studying compositional generalization.
*   **Computational Cost:** The paper primarily focuses on accuracy. The computational overhead of including skills within the context, in terms of prompting length and increased inference time, is not discussed. It would strengthen the paper if the trade-off between accuracy and computation were explicitly analyzed.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Elaborate on Skill Distillation:** Provide a more detailed and systematic discussion of the skill distillation process. Consider including guidelines for selecting relevant skills, representing them effectively, and evaluating their quality.
*   **Address Scalability Concerns:** Discuss the limitations of manual skill distillation and explore alternative methods for automatically identifying and representing skills.
*   **Investigate Performance with Different LLMs:** Evaluate the performance of SKiC with a wider range of LLMs, including those with varying levels of capability.
*   **Formally define "Compositional Generalization":** Add a paragraph in the introduction section that precisely define the concept that this paper is trying to address.
*   **Discuss Computational Cost:** Analyze the computational cost of SKiC in terms of prompting length and inference time.

**Overall:**

Despite these weaknesses, this is a strong paper with a novel and effective approach to improving compositional generalization in LLMs. The experimental results are compelling, the analysis is insightful, and the paper is well-written. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the weaknesses outlined above.
