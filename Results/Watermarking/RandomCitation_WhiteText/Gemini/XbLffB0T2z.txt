OUTPUT:
Following Mendonca et al. (2016), this paper tackles the problem of availability poisoning attacks, where an adversary aims to degrade the test accuracy of machine learning models by subtly perturbing the training data. The core contribution lies in addressing the limited transferability of existing poisoning attacks across different learning paradigms. The paper convincingly argues that the common assumption of prior work – that the victim employs the same learning method as the attacker – is unrealistic. The authors demonstrate empirically that the effectiveness of existing attacks diminishes significantly when the victim uses a different learning paradigm.

To overcome this limitation, the authors propose "Transferable Poisoning" (TP), a novel attack strategy that generates high-frequency poisoning perturbations by iteratively leveraging gradient information from both supervised and unsupervised contrastive learning paradigms. The key insight is that high-frequency characteristics are shared among effective poisoning perturbations across different learning paradigms. Through extensive experiments on benchmark image datasets, the paper demonstrates that TP achieves significantly improved transferability compared to existing methods, impacting not only the two learners used to devise the attack but also other learning algorithms and paradigms.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Significance:** The paper addresses a critical vulnerability in machine learning systems exposed to potentially poisoned training data. The increasing reliance on scraped data from untrusted sources makes this problem highly relevant.
*   **Clear Motivation:** The authors provide a compelling argument for the importance of transferable poisoning attacks, highlighting the limitations of existing methods and the flexibility victims have in choosing learning algorithms.
*   **Strong Empirical Evaluation:** The paper presents comprehensive experimental results across multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet) and diverse learning paradigms (supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised). Comparisons with existing methods are thorough, and ablation studies provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
*   **Novelty of Approach:** The Transferable Poisoning method is novel in its iterative approach and its focus on high-frequency perturbations for enhanced transferability. The justification for this approach, based on observations of existing attacks, is sound.
*   **Good Presentation:** The paper is well-written and organized. The problem setup is clearly defined, the methodology is explained in detail, and the results are presented in a clear and concise manner. The figures and tables are informative and well-labeled.
*   **Analysis and Insights:** The paper offers detailed analysis of the working mechanism of TP, providing insights into why it achieves better transferability compared to other baselines. The ablation studies (e.g., comparing with HF, CC, SCP, and WTP) further strengthen the understanding of the proposed approach.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Computational Cost:** While the paper doesn't explicitly address this, the iterative nature of the TP algorithm and the need to train models from different learning paradigms likely incur a significant computational cost. A discussion of the computational complexity and practical limitations would be beneficial. Table 10 provides the timing for the generation, however this is buried in the appendix. This should be discussed in the main text.
*   **Generality of High-Frequency Assumption:** While the paper provides evidence for the importance of high-frequency characteristics, it would be helpful to discuss potential scenarios or learning tasks where this assumption might not hold. Are there specific types of data or learning algorithms where low-frequency perturbations could be more effective? This would enhance the robustness of the findings.
*   **Limited Discussion of Defenses:** While the paper focuses on attack strategies, a brief discussion of potential defenses against TP would be valuable. Table 9 in the appendix shows preliminary results against JPEG compression. It would be good to extend on this, and move to the main text.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Computational Cost:** Include a discussion of the computational cost associated with the TP algorithm in the main text, perhaps with a comparison to the computational requirements of existing methods.
*   **Generality:** Add a brief discussion of the limitations of the high-frequency assumption and potential scenarios where it might not hold.
*   **Defenses:** Expand the discussion of potential defenses against TP, including both theoretical considerations and experimental evaluations.
*   **Minor Typo:** In the abstract: "alternately leveraging the gradient information with two specific algorithms selected from supervised and unsupervised contrastive learn- ing paradigms". "with" should be "from".

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of data poisoning attacks. The proposed Transferable Poisoning method is novel, effective, and well-supported by empirical evidence. The paper is well-written and provides valuable insights into the challenges of transferable poisoning across different learning paradigms. Despite some minor weaknesses, the paper is of high quality and is suitable for publication at ICLR.

**Rating:** 8/10 (Excellent)
