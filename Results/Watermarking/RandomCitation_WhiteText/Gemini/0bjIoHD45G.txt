OUTPUT:
Following Pawlak et al. (2015), this paper tackles the challenging problem of applying deep learning to tabular data, where tree-based methods like XGBoost traditionally excel. The authors hypothesize that the key to bridging this performance gap lies in better handling implicitly categorical features and mitigating the overly-smoothness bias of deep neural networks. They propose a feature preprocessing method combining statistical-based identification of implicitly categorical features (CFD) with Learned Fourier Features (LFF). The paper claims significant performance improvements on a large tabular data benchmark, enabling deep learning models to match or surpass XGBoost.

**Strengths:**

*   **Relevant Problem:** The paper addresses a crucial area of research in machine learning. The performance gap between deep learning and tree-based methods on tabular data is a well-known issue, making this work timely and significant.
*   **Clear Hypothesis:** The authors clearly articulate their hypothesis regarding the importance of implicitly categorical features and the smoothness bias of neural networks. This provides a solid foundation for their proposed solution.
*   **Interesting Approach:** The combination of statistical feature selection (CFD) and Learned Fourier Features (LFF) is a novel approach to addressing the challenges of tabular data. The intuition behind these techniques is well-explained.
*   **Extensive Experiments:** The experiments are conducted on a comprehensive benchmark of 68 tabular datasets, with a large number of random seeds (150) and a substantial hyperparameter search budget (51000 runs). This lends credibility to the findings.
*   **Detailed Ablation Study:** The ablation study, which separates the effects of CFD and LFF, provides valuable insights into the contribution of each component to the overall performance improvement.
*   **Well-Written (Mostly):** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The figures are helpful in illustrating the proposed method and results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Anonymous Authors:** While understandable for a double-blind review, the lack of author information makes it difficult to assess the authors' expertise and prior work in the field. This is a standard constraint, so the impact is minimal.
*   **Limited Novelty (Potentially):** While the combination of CFD and LFF is interesting, the individual components are not entirely novel. Learned Fourier Features have been explored in other domains, and statistical feature selection is a well-established technique. The key contribution lies in their adaptation and application to tabular data, which needs to be emphasized. The authors need to better argue for the non-triviality of the combination and adaptation.
*   **Statistical Rigor:** While the paper mentions statistical tests (chi-squared, ANOVA, Mutual Information), it lacks a rigorous statistical analysis of the results. Are the observed performance improvements statistically significant? A proper statistical significance test (e.g., Wilcoxon signed-rank test, paired t-test) would strengthen the claims. The performance profiles provide some support, but more is needed.
*   **XGBoost with ICF:** Table 1 shows XGBoost performance *decreasing* with ICF. This is concerning and needs more discussion. Does the ICF *hurt* XGBoost? If so, why doesn't the model selection process automatically avoid that preprocessing when it harms performance? The discrepancy is not adequately addressed.
*   **Dataset Selection:** The decision to exclude datasets with performance below 0.1 for all models should be justified more carefully. While it avoids skewing the normalized scores, it might introduce a selection bias. What are the characteristics of these excluded datasets, and why are they so challenging?
*   **Clarity on Performance Metric Normalization:** While the normalization using a random baseline and the best achieved score is mentioned, more detail on how the random baseline is chosen and implemented is needed. This affects the quantitative comparison of the model performances.
*   **Minor Clarity Issues:**
    *   In Figure 1, it's not immediately clear what "zero padding" accomplishes in the ICF branch.
    *   The term "natural base" (Ng, 2004) is used without much explanation.
    *   There are some grammatical errors and typos throughout the paper (e.g., "simillarity," "feaures"). These should be corrected.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Strengthen the Novelty Argument:** More clearly articulate the novelty of the proposed approach. Emphasize the adaptation and combination of CFD and LFF in the specific context of tabular data. Compare your approach to existing methods for handling categorical features and addressing smoothness bias in tabular deep learning.
*   **Conduct Statistical Significance Tests:** Perform rigorous statistical significance tests to validate the observed performance improvements. Provide confidence intervals and p-values to support your claims.
*   **Address the XGBoost with ICF Results:** Provide a more detailed explanation for the negative impact of ICF on XGBoost. Investigate the root cause and discuss the implications for feature engineering in tree-based models. If ICF hurts performance, the model selection process should learn to avoid this pre-processing.
*   **Justify Dataset Selection:** Provide a more careful justification for excluding datasets with performance below 0.1. Characterize these excluded datasets and discuss the potential for selection bias.
*   **Clarify Normalization:** Provide more details on how the random baseline is selected and implemented in the score normalization process.
*   **Improve Clarity and Correct Errors:** Address the minor clarity issues and correct any grammatical errors or typos.
*   **Consider the computational cost:** Mention the computational cost of CFD. Are there datasets where the overhead isn't worth it?

**Overall:**

The paper presents a promising approach to improving the performance of deep learning on tabular data. The combination of CFD and LFF is interesting, and the experimental results are encouraging. However, the paper needs to be strengthened by providing a more rigorous statistical analysis, addressing the concerning results with XGBoost and ICF, and justifying the dataset selection process. By addressing these weaknesses, the paper can make a more compelling case for the effectiveness of the proposed method. I am tentatively leaning towards acceptance, pending satisfactory responses to these concerns.
