OUTPUT:
Following Homan et al. (2015), this paper introduces a twist on finite-sum minimization called "continual finite-sum minimization," where the goal is to find a sequence of points that minimize the prefix-sum of functions at each step. The paper proposes a first-order method, CSVRG, and claims a nearly tight first-order oracle (FO) complexity of ˜O(n/ϵ1/3 + 1/√ϵ) under strong convexity assumptions. The paper also presents a lower bound result that indicates the proposed method is nearly optimal among a class of "natural" first-order methods.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Problem Formulation:** The "continual finite-sum minimization" problem is a relevant and interesting formulation motivated by continual learning and online data settings. The connection to catastrophic forgetting is clearly stated.
*   **Significant Improvement in Complexity:** The proposed CSVRG algorithm offers a substantial improvement in FO complexity compared to naive applications of SGD and variance reduction methods, especially for the practical regime of ϵ=O(1/n).
*   **Nearly Tight Lower Bound:** The establishment of a lower bound provides theoretical justification for the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.
*   **Well-Structured and Detailed Explanation of the Algorithm:** The paper clearly explains the components of CSVRG (Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2). The role of ˜∇i is well-explained. The challenges and motivations are clearly presented.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The experimental results show that CSVRG interpolates between SGD-like and VR-like approaches, achieving better suboptimality than SGD with the same number of FO calls and comparable performance to Katyusha/SVRG with fewer FO calls. Further evaluations with neural networks are conducted.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Strong Convexity Assumption:** The theoretical guarantees are limited to the strongly convex case, which might not be applicable to all machine learning problems. The limitations section in the abstract clearly indicates that this remains a promising research direction.
*   **Limited Novelty in Techniques:** While the algorithm achieves good complexity, the techniques employed (variance reduction and incremental gradient methods) are built upon existing work. The novelty lies more in the specific combination and adaptation of these techniques to the continual setting. The reviewer would have liked the author to clearly demonstrate what kind of new theoretical challenges required new analysis compared to SVRG for example.
*   **Definition of "Natural" First-Order Methods:** While the definition of "natural" first-order methods is provided, it would be beneficial to provide more discussion and justification for why this is a meaningful class of algorithms to consider. It's unclear whether all VR methods necessarily fall into this class.
*   **Experimental Settings Could be More Rigorous:** The experimental evaluation, while promising, could be strengthened by including a wider range of datasets, more thorough hyperparameter tuning, and comparison with more recent continual learning algorithms. The evaluation with neural networks and non-stationary distributions is a nice direction.
*   **Minor Clarity Issues in Writing:** The writing, while generally clear, has some minor grammatical errors and could benefit from careful proofreading.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Discuss Limitations of Strong Convexity:** Acknowledge the limitations of the strong convexity assumption and discuss potential future directions for extending the results to broader classes of functions.
*   **Clarify Relation to Existing Techniques:** Explicitly state the novelty of techniques over traditional variance-reduction methods. What kind of new challenges existed in the proof that did not exist in the SVRG paper?
*   **Justify "Natural" First-Order Method Definition:** Provide more justification for the class of "natural" first-order methods and examples of methods that would *not* fall into this class.
*   **Strengthen Experimental Evaluation:** Expand the experimental evaluation to include more datasets, more algorithms from the continual learning literature, and more rigorous hyperparameter tuning. It would be interesting to see the performance of other continual learning algorithms.
*   **Proofread Carefully:** Carefully proofread the paper to correct minor grammatical errors and improve overall clarity.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a novel and relevant problem formulation with promising theoretical and experimental results. The proposed CSVRG algorithm offers a significant improvement in computational complexity for continual finite-sum minimization. While the strong convexity assumption and the definition of "natural" first-order methods could be better justified, and the experimental evaluation could be strengthened, the paper represents a valuable contribution to the field of optimization for continual learning.
