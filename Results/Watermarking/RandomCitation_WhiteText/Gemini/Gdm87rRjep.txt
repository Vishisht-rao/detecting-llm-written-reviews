OUTPUT:
Following Quinonez et al. (2023), this paper presents an interesting approach to improve the accuracy-efficiency trade-off in large language model (LLM) inference by prompting compressed models. The core idea is based on the observation that carefully designed prompts can significantly improve the generation quality of compressed LLMs, even matching the performance of their uncompressed counterparts. The paper proposes a soft prompt learning method to enhance prompt performance and demonstrates its transferability across various datasets, tasks, and compression levels.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The idea of using prompts to mitigate the accuracy loss due to compression is novel and potentially impactful. The paper addresses a crucial problem in LLM deployment, i.e., the high computational cost. The finding that prompts can be transferred across datasets and compression levels is valuable for practical applications.
*   **Clarity and Structure:** The paper is well-structured and easy to follow. The motivation is clearly explained, and the proposed method is presented in a logical manner. The introduction provides a good overview of the problem and the proposed solution.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The experimental results are comprehensive and support the claims made in the paper. The evaluation includes various datasets, compression methods (quantization and pruning), and model sizes (OPT and LLaMA families). The comparisons with baselines and other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA are well-done. The additional experiments in the appendix provide further evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
*   **Reproducibility:** The paper includes sufficient details about the experimental setup, including the hardware, software, datasets, and hyperparameters. The inclusion of package versions in Table 4 is helpful for reproducibility. The code availability would further enhance reproducibility.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Theoretical Justification:** While the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method empirically, it lacks a deeper theoretical justification for why the prompts work. Understanding the underlying mechanisms would strengthen the paper. The final section D, which attempts to understand the learned prompts from a natural language perspective, is a good start but doesn't provide conclusive evidence.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The paper does not extensively discuss the sensitivity of the results to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the length of the prompt tokens or the learning rate. An ablation study on these parameters would be beneficial. While they include the number of soft tokens study on Table 8, sensitivity analysis on the learning rate is missing.
*   **Comparison with Other Prompting Techniques:** The paper mentions previous works on prompt tuning but does not thoroughly compare the proposed method with other state-of-the-art prompting techniques. A more detailed comparison would help position the paper in the broader context of prompt engineering research. In particular, given the observation that general-dataset-trained prompt can be transferred to other datasets and domain-specific-dataset-trained prompt cannot, comparisons with existing prompt tuning techniques should be more extensive.
*   **Discussion of Limitations:** The "Limitations" section in the appendix is brief and could be expanded. A more in-depth discussion of the limitations of the proposed method would improve the overall quality of the paper. Furthermore, the "Potential Negative Societal Impacts" section focuses solely on energy consumption and could be broadened to consider other potential ethical concerns.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Provide a more detailed analysis of the learned prompts:** Investigate the properties of the learned prompt embeddings and try to understand what kind of information they encode. Perhaps visualizing the attention weights of the prompt tokens could offer some insights.
*   **Conduct a hyperparameter sensitivity analysis:** Investigate the impact of different hyperparameters on the performance of the proposed method.
*   **Compare with other prompting techniques:** Provide a more detailed comparison of the proposed method with other state-of-the-art prompting techniques.
*   **Expand the discussion of limitations and societal impacts:** Provide a more in-depth discussion of the limitations of the proposed method and consider other potential ethical concerns beyond energy consumption.
*   **Release the code and the learned prompts:** Releasing the code and the learned prompts would greatly benefit the community and facilitate further research in this area.
*   **English quality:** While the English is generally understandable, some sentences could be rephrased for better clarity and fluency. A careful proofread is recommended.

**Overall:**

This is a well-written and interesting paper that presents a novel approach to improve the accuracy-efficiency trade-off in LLM inference. The experimental results are convincing, and the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field. Despite the minor weaknesses mentioned above, I believe this paper is worthy of acceptance.
