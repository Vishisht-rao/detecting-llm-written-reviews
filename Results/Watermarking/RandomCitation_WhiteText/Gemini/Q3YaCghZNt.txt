OUTPUT:
Following Harbaugh et al. (2024), this paper presents LEMUR, a novel framework for integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with automated program verification tools. The core idea is to leverage LLMs' code understanding capabilities to propose program invariants and sub-goals, which are then validated by traditional automated reasoners. The paper formalizes this interaction as a proof calculus, proves its soundness, and demonstrates its practical effectiveness through experiments on synthetic and competition benchmarks.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The approach of combining LLMs and automated reasoners is timely and addresses a key challenge in program verification: the difficulty of high-level abstract reasoning about program properties. The formalization of this hybrid approach as a proof calculus is a significant contribution. This is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first such formalization.
*   **Soundness:** The paper provides a clear and rigorous soundness proof for the LEMUR calculus. This is crucial for ensuring the reliability of the verification results.
*   **Practical Evaluation:** The experimental results demonstrate the practical potential of LEMUR. The experiments on the Code2Inv benchmarks show that LEMUR can be competitive with existing learning-based verification approaches and even outperform them. Moreover, LEMUR's ability to solve some hard SV-COMP benchmarks beyond the reach of state-of-the-art conventional verifiers is impressive.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and clearly explains the concepts and methodology. The running example effectively illustrates how LEMUR works in practice. The algorithm presented in Alg. 1 is well-commented and easy to follow.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors claim that the source code and benchmarks are publicly available, which enhances the reproducibility of the results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Termination Guarantees:** While the paper addresses the non-termination issues by introducing Condition 1 and bounding the number of proposals, the restrictions may limit the ability of the approach to solve certain types of problems that require deeper exploration. While Theorem 4.1 guarantees termination, the practical implications of these restrictions on the algorithm's effectiveness need to be considered.
*   **LLM Uncertainty:** The reliance on LLMs introduces a degree of uncertainty and non-determinism into the verification process. Although the paper discusses some strategies for mitigating this, such as formatting the output and ordering the proposals, the behavior of LLMs can be unpredictable, and this can affect the performance and reliability of LEMUR.
*   **Limited Scalability:** The paper acknowledges that LEMUR does not yet offer a significant boost for complex properties of real-world C libraries. The scalability of the approach to larger and more complex programs remains a concern.
*   **Oracle Engineering:** The paper focuses on presenting the calculus but it would benefit from a deeper exploration of the LLM prompting strategies and their impact on performance. The prompt engineering aspect seems crucial, and a more detailed analysis of different prompting techniques and their effectiveness would be valuable. While some details are provided in the extended version, a summary of these insights should be included in the main paper.
*   **Stability vs. Invariant:** The paper defines the term "stable". It could be more precise to use the term "state-stable" or "execution-stable". Also, while the paper mentions that the Lemma 2.1 proof is in the extended version of the paper, it would be better to have a brief proof sketch in the main document for completeness.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Discuss limitations more thoroughly:** Elaborate on the types of programs and properties that LEMUR is currently unable to handle and discuss potential solutions. The discussion about scaling to real-world C libraries can be improved.
*   **Elaborate on Prompt Engineering:** Add more details about the prompt engineering process and the specific prompts used in the experiments. A discussion of how different prompts affect the performance of LEMUR would be valuable. Briefly include a summary of the contents of the extended version related to prompts.
*   **Address Termination:** Even though the paper presents the algorithm's termination guarantees, the authors should more thoroughly acknowledge that Condition 1 might limit its capabilities.
*   **Discuss the performance of the base solvers:** In the extended version, discuss in detail the performance of ESBMC and UA UTOMIZER.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and promising approach to integrating LLMs with automated program verification. The formalization of the approach as a proof calculus and the experimental results demonstrate its potential effectiveness. While there are some limitations and areas for improvement, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field. I recommend acceptance, conditional on addressing the suggestions above.
