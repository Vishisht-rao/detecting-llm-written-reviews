OUTPUT:
Following Applewhite et al. (2017), this paper tackles the Fast Equilibrium Conjecture for SGD in normalized neural networks, a problem introduced by Li et al. (2020). The conjecture posits that normalized networks, when trained with SGD and weight decay, reach equilibrium much faster than predicted by classical mixing time analyses. While previous works (Wang & Wang, 2022; Li et al., 2022c) have provided proofs under specific assumptions, this paper aims to provide a more general proof by removing the non-generic assumptions of isolated minima, unique basins of attraction, and analytic minima sets. The main technical contribution is showing that trajectories are unlikely to escape their initial basin in exponential time.

**Strengths:**

*   **Significant Generalization:** The paper successfully removes restrictive assumptions from previous proofs of the Fast Equilibrium Conjecture, making the result more applicable to real-world scenarios. The removal of the unique basin assumption is particularly valuable, as empirical evidence suggests the presence of multiple basins in realistic training.
*   **Clear Problem Statement and Motivation:** The introduction clearly explains the conjecture, its importance, and the limitations of existing works. The authors provide compelling arguments for why the removed assumptions are non-generic and why the maintained assumptions are essential.
*   **Probabilistic Approach:** The paper employs a purely probabilistic approach, leveraging large deviation principles, rather than relying on semi-classical spectral analysis. This seems to be a key enabler for removing the analyticity assumption.
*   **Well-Structured and Detailed Proofs:** While the proofs are technically involved, they are presented in a relatively well-organized manner. The appendices provide further details and justifications for the theoretical components. The main results, namely Theorem 2.4 are very clearly stated.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The experiments provide some empirical evidence to support the theoretical findings. The SWAP experiments, in particular, offer interesting insights into the geometry of the loss landscape.
*   **Thorough Literature Review:** The paper acknowledges and builds upon a wide range of related works in optimization, normalization, and large deviation theory.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Technical Complexity:** The paper is highly technical and requires a strong background in stochastic processes, large deviation theory, and optimization to fully understand. This limits the accessibility of the work to a specialized audience.
*   **Limited Experimental Validation:** While the experiments are interesting, they are relatively small-scale and focus primarily on demonstrating the local mixing and SWAP failure phenomena. It would be beneficial to see more extensive experiments on larger datasets and more complex architectures to further validate the theoretical claims. Demonstrating the practical impact of the theoretical results is not clear from the experiments.
*   **Notations and Assumptions are Heavy:** Though the authors give remarks on the assumptions, there are still lots of them. The narrative would be stronger if the core assumptions were explicitly highlighted at the beginning.
*   **Clarity of novelty in relation to Dembo & Zeitouni:** While the authors mention that modifications to the Dembo-Zeitouni's work are needed, it might be helpful to highlight more explicitly what is novel in their approach.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Improve Accessibility:** Consider adding a more intuitive explanation of the main technical contributions and their implications for practitioners. Providing a visual illustration of the multi-basin landscape and the trajectory behavior could be helpful.
*   **Expand Experimental Validation:** Conduct more extensive experiments on larger datasets and architectures to provide stronger empirical support for the theoretical findings. Consider comparing the performance of SGD with and without normalization under different initialization schemes to see whether normalization helps escape local traps to some extent.
*   **Clarify the Assumptions and Notations:** Consider providing a glossary of key terms and notations.
*   **Highlight Technical Novelty:** The authors emphasize that their use of a Dembo-Zeitouni large deviation principle is different from Freidlin-Wentzell based analysis. How is it really different, and why is this needed?
*   **Proofreading:** There are some minor typos and grammatical errors throughout the paper that should be corrected. For example, in section 4, both R- and R+ are "near these bounds." This suggests perhaps more specification may be required.

**Overall:**

This is a technically sound and theoretically significant paper that makes a valuable contribution to the understanding of SGD in normalized neural networks. By removing restrictive assumptions and providing a more general proof of the Fast Equilibrium Conjecture, the authors have advanced the state-of-the-art in this area. While the paper is highly technical and would benefit from more extensive experimental validation, its theoretical contributions are substantial and warrant publication.
