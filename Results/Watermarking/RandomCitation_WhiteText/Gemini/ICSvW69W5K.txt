OUTPUT:
Following Stansbury et al. (2018), this paper addresses the problem of semantic parsing for knowledge base question answering (KBQA). The authors propose a grammar augmented with candidate expressions to improve the accuracy of semantic parsers, particularly in handling large knowledge bases. The key idea is to combine constrained decoding methods for compositional structures with the generation of KB components, which correspond to candidate expressions. They experiment on the challenging KQAPro benchmark and report state-of-the-art results.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The idea of incorporating candidate expressions into a grammar-based semantic parser with a seq2seq PLM is a valuable contribution. It addresses a key limitation of existing grammar-based approaches, which often lack the ability to effectively utilize large KB information. The unification of compositional structure generation and KB component generation within a single grammar is well-motivated.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The proposed approach is well-defined and technically sound. The explanation of the grammar, type constraints, and candidate expression integration is clear. The efficient implementation using tries and the optimization techniques are important for practical applicability. The algorithms presented in the appendix show a solid understanding of computational efficiency.
*   **Experimental Evaluation:** The experiments on KQAPro demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The ablation studies provide insights into the contribution of different components, particularly the importance of candidate expressions and various type constraints. The comparisons with existing state-of-the-art models are comprehensive.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The figures and tables are helpful in understanding the approach and results. The related work section is thorough.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors state that the code will be publicly available if accepted, which increases the potential for reproducibility and further research.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Analysis of Failure Cases:** While the paper presents accuracy results, it could benefit from a more in-depth qualitative analysis of failure cases. Understanding the types of questions or logical forms where the approach struggles would provide valuable insights for future improvements. While the appendix E gives an example, a discussion of a larger number of error cases is warranted.
*   **Scalability Concerns:** Although the paper mentions efficiency, the scalability of the approach to even larger KBs could be a concern. The number of candidate expressions and the size of the tries could grow significantly, potentially impacting performance. The paper could benefit from a discussion of potential strategies for addressing this issue.
*   **Impact of Batch Size:** The paper mentions the impact of batch size on decoding time. It might be useful to discuss the effect of batch size on the overall accuracy of the model and to analyze if there are any trade-offs between accuracy and decoding time.
*   **Comparison of Optimization Algorithms:** While it shows that using Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 decreases decoding time, it does not discuss in detail the benefits of each of the individual optimization algorithms. A discussion of the time complexity of the algorithms is also missing.
*   **Some parts are difficult to follow:** The writing in some parts is difficult to follow. The grammar could be more formalized, and the role of each variable should be defined before its first use.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Add more details on the KB used:** Include more details about KQAPro, such as the size of the knowledge base, the types of entities and relations it contains, and the complexity of the logical forms used in the dataset.
*   **Elaborate on the design choices:** Justify the design choices made in the grammar, such as the specific types and production rules used. Explain how these choices are tailored to the KQAPro dataset and the specific challenges of KBQA.
*   **Discuss limitations:** Acknowledge the limitations of the approach and discuss potential areas for future research. For example, address the scalability concerns, the handling of more complex logical forms, or the integration of external information sources.
*   **Include runtime information:** Discuss if there is any trade-off in performance when using 	HYBR, compared to 	TYPE, and discuss any optimizations that were performed to improve runtime.
*   **Analyze different optimization algorithms:** Elaborate on the benefits of each of the individual optimization algorithms and discuss its time complexity.
*   **Rephrase complicated sentences:** Make sure that each sentence conveys its meaning clearly. It is especially important to define variables clearly before its first use.

**Overall Assessment:**

The paper presents a novel and effective approach to semantic parsing for KBQA. The integration of candidate expressions into a grammar-based parser is a significant contribution, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness. Despite some weaknesses in the analysis and discussion, the paper is well-written, technically sound, and presents valuable insights for the field. I recommend acceptance, pending minor revisions addressing the suggestions above.
