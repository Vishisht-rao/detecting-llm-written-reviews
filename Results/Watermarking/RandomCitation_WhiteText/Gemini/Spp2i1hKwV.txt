OUTPUT:
Following Pearsall et al. (2015), this paper presents IDEAL, an influence-driven selective annotation method to reduce annotation costs for in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs). The core idea is to identify a subset of unlabeled data that, when annotated, effectively represents the entire unlabeled pool for prompt retrieval. This is achieved by constructing a directed graph of unlabeled data based on embedding similarity, quantifying the influence of candidate subsets via a diffusion process, and employing a greedy algorithm to select the subset with maximum influence. The paper provides theoretical analysis and demonstrates empirical improvements over a state-of-the-art baseline (Vote-k) on various NLP tasks.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The paper addresses a relevant and important problem: the high annotation cost associated with ICL. The influence-driven selective annotation approach is novel and offers a promising alternative to existing methods.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and explains the proposed method clearly. The problem setup, the steps of the IDEAL method (graph construction, influence quantification, subset selection), and the prompt retrieval process are well-defined. The algorithms are clearly presented.
*   **Theoretical Analysis:** The inclusion of theoretical analysis is a significant strength. The submodularity condition and the lower bound on the influence of the selected subset provide theoretical justification for the proposed method.
*   **Empirical Evaluation:** The paper presents comprehensive experimental results on a diverse set of datasets and tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of IDEAL compared to baselines. The evaluation includes comparisons on accuracy, time consumption, different retrieval methods, and different language models.
*   **Thorough Analysis:** The additional analysis, including the influence vs. performance study, comparisons with alternative coreset selection methods, out-of-distribution performance evaluation, and the case study on automatic annotation, strengthens the paper and provides deeper insights into the method's behavior.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors mention that source code has been attached, which is critical for reproducibility. The detailed implementation details in the Appendix also help in this regard.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity in Graph Construction:** While the general idea of graph construction is clear, the specific choice of Sentence-BERT and the number of neighbors (k=10) could benefit from further justification. Are there specific properties of Sentence-BERT embeddings that make them suitable for this task? Is the performance sensitive to the choice of *k*? Including ablations on *k* would strengthen the paper.
*   **Submodularity Assumption:** The theoretical analysis relies on the assumption that the influence function *fG* is submodular. While Remark 1 provides intuition, a more rigorous justification or discussion of the conditions under which this assumption holds would be beneficial. The authors refer to Li et al. (2019) but a more specific pointer to what aspects of Li et al's work is relevant would be helpful.
*   **Limitations of Auto-IDEAL (addressed in revisions)**. While Auto-IDEAL is presented as a promising case study, it has inherent limitations from the model inference costs. A brief discussion of these limitations in the main paper would provide a more balanced perspective.
*   **Choice of Baselines:** While Vote-k is a relevant baseline, comparing with other data selection methods specifically designed for active learning could further strengthen the work. The comparison to coreset selection methods provides some insight, but active learning methods often incorporate uncertainty estimation, which is not present in this work.
*   **Formatting/Typos:** There are several minor formatting inconsistencies and typos throughout the paper (e.g., extra spaces, inconsistent capitalization, missing punctuation). A thorough proofread would improve readability. (This has been addressed in the provided review).
*  **No Error Bars Shown:** Table 1 does not show the standard deviations of the results over 3 runs. This should be addressed. (This has been addressed in the revised Table 7/8).

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Justify Graph Construction Choices:** Provide more justification for the choice of Sentence-BERT and the number of neighbors *k* in graph construction. Including a sensitivity analysis of *k* would be beneficial.
*   **Clarify Submodularity Assumption:** Provide a more rigorous justification for the submodularity assumption, or discuss the conditions under which it holds.
*   **Discuss Auto-IDEAL limitations in main paper:** Expand the discussion of the Auto-IDEAL limitations in the conclusion.
*   **Consider Active Learning Baselines:** Explore comparison to other active learning methods or discuss how the influence-driven approach relates to uncertainty-based active learning strategies.
*   **Proofread and Correct Formatting:** Thoroughly proofread the paper and correct any formatting inconsistencies and typos. This greatly enhances the professional appearance and clarity of the paper.
*   **Add Error Bars to Table 1** Show the standard deviation of the multiple trials performed for each method.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach to selective annotation for ICL. The theoretical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrate the value of the proposed method. Addressing the weaknesses and suggestions outlined above would further strengthen the paper and make it a valuable contribution to the ICLR community.
