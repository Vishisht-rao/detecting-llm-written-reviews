OUTPUT:
Following Sanborn et al. (2016), this paper presents FLNeRF, a novel approach for 3D facial landmark estimation directly on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). The authors propose a coarse-to-fine framework that leverages the continuous representation of NeRFs to predict accurate 3D landmarks. They also introduce an expression augmentation technique to enhance the model's robustness to various facial expressions. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of FLNeRF through qualitative and quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and showcases its potential in downstream applications such as face editing and swapping.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The paper addresses a relatively unexplored area of research, which is predicting 3D facial landmarks directly from NeRFs. This direct approach is a significant contribution as it bypasses the need for intermediate representations and potentially avoids information loss.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The coarse-to-fine framework is well-motivated and provides a plausible strategy for efficient and accurate landmark detection. The use of 3D convolutions and position encoding to capture spatial information is also appropriate. The data augmentation techniques, especially the expression augmentation using 3D TPS, are creative and effectively address the limitations of existing datasets.
*   **Strong Experimental Results:** The quantitative results in Table 1 convincingly demonstrate that FLNeRF outperforms existing 2D and 3D landmark estimation methods, especially in handling exaggerated expressions. The qualitative results in Figures 3 and 4 visually confirm the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method. The application to in-the-wild images using EG3D inversion is a good demonstration of the model's generalization ability.
*   **Clear Writing and Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The introduction clearly outlines the problem and contributions. The related work section provides a comprehensive overview of existing methods. The proposed method is explained in detail, and the experimental setup and results are presented clearly. The figures and tables are informative and easy to understand.
*   **Application Demonstrations:** Showing how FLNeRF can be used in face swapping and face editing effectively illustrates the value of the accurate 3D landmark estimation.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Ablation Study:** While the ablation study in Table 2 provides some insights, it could be more comprehensive. For example, it would be helpful to see the impact of different components of the position encoding or the choice of different backbone architectures (VGG vs. VoxResNet) in the main paper. The results using VGG are relegated to the supplementary material.
*   **Dataset Details:** While FaceScape is mentioned, more details about the specific training/testing split and the process of creating the 110 expressions would be beneficial. How were the landmarks for the augmented expressions generated? Were they manually annotated or automatically generated using the TPS warping?
*   **Computational Cost:** The paper does not provide any information about the computational cost of FLNeRF in terms of training time, inference time, and memory usage. This information is important for assessing the practicality of the proposed method.
*   **Failure Cases:** It would be helpful to see some examples of failure cases where FLNeRF performs poorly. This would provide a better understanding of the limitations of the proposed method and suggest potential areas for improvement.
*   **MoFaNeRF Dependency:** The application section heavily relies on MoFaNeRF. While the authors clearly explain how they adapted MoFaNeRF, it would be more impactful if the landmarks were used in a different face manipulation pipeline to demonstrate the versatility of the approach further. Is this modification easily applicable to other NeRF architectures?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   Expand the ablation study to include more components and hyperparameters.
*   Provide more details about the dataset and the generation of augmented expressions.
*   Include information about the computational cost of FLNeRF.
*   Showcase some failure cases and discuss potential reasons for the failures.
*   Consider demonstrating the use of FLNeRF landmarks in a different face manipulation pipeline.
*   Consider how this approach could be adapted to more general NeRF structures beyond face NeRFs.

**Overall Score:**

This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of 3D facial landmark estimation by proposing a novel and effective approach based on NeRFs. The strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses, and the results are compelling. I recommend this paper for acceptance, with the suggestion that the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above.

**Rating:** 7 (Good)
