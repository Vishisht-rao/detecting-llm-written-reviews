OUTPUT:
Following Prendergast et al. (2023), this paper presents a deep learning approach for estimating long memory parameters in stochastic processes. The authors focus on estimating the Hurst exponent for fractional Brownian motion (fBm) and fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (fOU) processes, and the differencing parameter 'd' for Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (ARFIMA) processes. They train 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks using synthetic data generated from efficient process generators and compare their performance against conventional statistical methods. The paper claims that the neural network models outperform traditional methods in terms of precision, speed, consistency, and robustness.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Relevance:** The application of deep learning for parameter estimation in long memory stochastic processes, particularly for fOU and ARFIMA processes where neural network-based estimators are scarce in the literature, is a valuable contribution. The problem itself is relevant, as accurate estimation of long memory parameters is crucial in various fields.
*   **Methodology:** The use of synthetic data generation for training is a well-justified approach given the often limited availability of real-world data and the need for large datasets for training deep learning models. The authors mention the employment of efficient process generators using circulant embedding and FFT, which is a good practice for scalability.
*   **Comprehensive Experiments:** The paper includes experiments on fBm, ARFIMA, and fOU processes, providing a broad evaluation of the proposed approach. They compare their models with several baseline estimators, which adds credibility to the results. The investigation into the consistency of the estimators by training on different sequence lengths is also a strong point.
*   **Clear Presentation (mostly):** The abstract and introduction clearly outline the problem, the proposed solution, and the key findings. The description of the neural network architectures is relatively detailed.
*   **Open Sourcing of code:** The authors make a note that the python code will be available.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Theoretical Justification:** While the paper demonstrates empirical success, it lacks deeper theoretical analysis. For example, a more in-depth discussion on why CNNs and LSTMs are well-suited for this specific parameter estimation task would strengthen the paper. A theoretical underpinning for the choices of specific hyperparameters could also be included. The intuition given for why particular transforms result in invariance is good, but could be formalized further.
*   **Generator Adequacy is Paramount:** The authors mention the "quality of the process generator itself" is the main bottleneck of the training paradigm. However, the statistical tests used to determine this (Higuchi's method and p-variation estimators for fBm, and three-step statistical analysis for fOU) are only briefly mentioned, and their sensitivity to deviations from the true process are not fully explored. While there are sections dedicated to this in the appendix, these could be more thoroughly discussed in the main body of the text.
*   **Lack of Ablation Studies:** It would be beneficial to include ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of the neural network architecture, such as the standardization layer. Table 1 contains such data, but this could be more thoroughly explored and discussed in the paper.
*   **Comparison with State-of-the-Art:** While the paper mentions existing work, the comparison is somewhat superficial. A more detailed analysis of how the proposed approach compares to the current state-of-the-art in neural network-based Hurst exponent estimation, particularly regarding accuracy and computational efficiency, is needed.
*   **Experiment Details:** The random distributions governing parameters should be reported alongside the length. Specifically, the models are trained using $H \sim U(0,1)$, this should be clearly reported alongside sequence lengths.
*   **Clarity in the Appendices:** Some sections in the appendix lack clarity and could benefit from better explanations. The experiments testing the various processes, particularly the stress-testing of the neural estimators could be expanded upon.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Provide More Theoretical Insights:** Elaborate on the theoretical justification for using CNNs and LSTMs for long memory parameter estimation. Explain how these models capture the long-range dependencies in the data.
*   **Strengthen the Discussion of Generator Validation:** Expand the discussion on the validation of the synthetic data generators. Provide a more rigorous analysis of the statistical tests used to ensure the generated data accurately reflects the target distributions.
*   **Include Ablation Studies:** Conduct ablation studies to evaluate the contribution of different components of the neural network architecture, such as the shift, scale, and drift invariance layers.
*   **Improve Comparison with Existing Work:** Conduct a more thorough comparison with existing neural network-based methods for Hurst exponent estimation. Include a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art.
*   **Address the choice of metrics:** The metrics $\hat{b}_\epsilon$ and $\hat{\sigma}_\epsilon$ are used in various experiments. However, no justification is provided for the particular choices of $\epsilon$.
*   **Clarify descriptions**: At various stages, the descriptions are confusing or lack clarity. For example, section D.1 contains various algebraic constructs that have no immediately understandable motivation.
*   **Address minor writing errors**: There are various typos throughout the paper.
*   **Reconsider title:**: The approach presented by this paper involves training deep neural networks to perform parameter estimation; the methods themselves are not processes.

**Overall:**

The paper presents a promising approach for long memory parameter estimation using deep learning. The empirical results are encouraging, demonstrating the potential of neural networks to outperform traditional statistical methods. However, the paper would benefit from a more in-depth theoretical analysis, a stronger discussion of the synthetic data generation process, and a more comprehensive comparison with existing work. Addressing these weaknesses would significantly enhance the impact and significance of the paper. I would recommend this paper for acceptance contingent upon addressing the weaknesses listed above.
