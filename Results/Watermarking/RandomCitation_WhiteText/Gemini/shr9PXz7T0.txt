OUTPUT:
Following Maynor et al. (2016), this paper presents a compelling investigation into the "selection bias" exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs) when answering multiple-choice questions (MCQs). The core finding is that LLMs are not robust to option position changes, often exhibiting a preference for specific option IDs (e.g., always choosing "Option A"). The paper convincingly argues that this bias stems primarily from "token bias," where the model inherently assigns higher probabilities to specific ID tokens (A, B, C, D) rather than evaluating the content of the options themselves. This is further supported by ablation studies showing a more significant reduction in bias when removing option IDs altogether compared to shuffling them.

The authors propose PriDe, a novel, label-free, inference-time debiasing method that estimates the model's prior bias for option IDs and separates it from the overall prediction distribution. PriDe demonstrates significant effectiveness and efficiency, especially in low-resource scenarios, and boasts interpretability and cross-domain transferability.

**Strengths:**

*   **Important and Timely Problem:** The paper addresses a critical issue in LLM evaluation and deployment, highlighting a vulnerability that can skew benchmark results and potentially lead to unreliable real-world applications.
*   **Rigorous Empirical Analysis:** The study's strength lies in its extensive empirical evaluation, covering 20 LLMs, three benchmarks, and varying option numbers. This provides strong evidence for the prevalence and nature of selection bias. The ablation studies are particularly well-designed and insightful.
*   **Clear Identification of Token Bias:** The paper effectively disentangles token bias from position bias, providing a more nuanced understanding of the underlying causes of selection bias. The paper provides solid evidence to support this claim.
*   **Effective Debiasing Method (PriDe):** The proposed PriDe method is both effective and efficient. The label-free and inference-time nature of PriDe is well-suited for modern LLM applications. Its interpretability and cross-domain transferability are also valuable assets.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The structure is logical, and the explanations are clear. The figures and tables are informative and well-integrated into the text.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors have released their code, data, and experimental results, contributing to the reproducibility of their work.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Potential Oversimplification of Position Bias:** While the paper demonstrates the primary role of token bias, it might be slightly dismissive of the impact of position bias. Although the experiments suggest it's less regular and model-dependent, its potential interplay with token bias warrants more discussion. The analysis of why llama-2-13/70B selection bias increased in MMLU and ARC after option IDs were removed could be expanded.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Further Investigate Position Bias:** Expand the discussion on potential conditions where position bias might be more significant or how it interacts with token bias. Explore the possibility of specific model architectures or training procedures that make models more susceptible to position bias.
*   **Comparison with other Debiasing techniques:** Compare PriDe with other existing bias mitigation techniques for language models, even if not directly applicable to the MCQ format. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of PriDe in relation to these methods.
*   **Address Calibration:** The authors touch upon calibration in the appendix but do not give it significant treatment. Future work to understand how to more directly relate the prior to LLM calibration might strengthen the analysis.

**Overall:**

This is a high-quality paper that makes a significant contribution to the understanding of bias and robustness in LLMs. The empirical analysis is thorough, the proposed method is effective, and the writing is clear. I recommend acceptance.
