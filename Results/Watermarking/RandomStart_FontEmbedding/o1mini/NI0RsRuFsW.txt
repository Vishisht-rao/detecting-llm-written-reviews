**Review of "How Hard Is Trojan Detection in DNNs? Fooling Detectors with Evasive Trojans"**

**Summary**

This paper addresses the key topic of enhancing the evasiveness of trojan attacks in deep neural networks (DNNs) to undermine existing detection mechanisms. The authors introduce a novel method for creating "evasive trojans" by incorporating a distribution matching loss inspired by the Wasserstein distance, along with specificity and randomization losses. The proposed approach aims to make trojaned models indistinguishable from clean models across a broad spectrum of detectors. The authors conduct extensive experiments across multiple datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and GTSRB) and evaluate their method against eight different detection strategies, including state-of-the-art algorithms. The results demonstrate that the evasive trojans significantly degrade the performance of current detectors, often reducing detection efficacy to near-chance levels. Additionally, the study reveals that these trojans are unexpectedly harder to reverse-engineer, highlighting a critical vulnerability in current defense mechanisms.

**Strengths**

1. **Originality and Significance**: The paper tackles a pressing and underexplored aspect of trojan attacks in DNNsâ€”making them more evasive against a wide range of detectors. This contributes significantly to the understanding of the offense-defense dynamics in neural network security.

2. **Comprehensive Methodology**: The authors present a well-structured and theoretically grounded approach to designing evasive trojans. The use of distribution matching, specificity, and randomization losses is innovative and thoughtfully integrated into the training process.

3. **Extensive Experiments**: Conducting experiments on over 6,000 neural networks across diverse datasets and attack scenarios provides robust evidence of the method's effectiveness. Evaluating against eight different detectors ensures that the findings are comprehensive and generalizable.

4. **Unexpected Findings**: The discovery that evasive trojans are harder to reverse-engineer, despite the method not being explicitly designed for this purpose, is both surprising and alarming. This insight underscores the depth of the security challenges posed by such attacks.

5. **Clarity and Presentation**: The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of complex concepts. Figures and tables are effectively used to illustrate key results, making the findings accessible and understandable.

**Weaknesses**

1. **Assumptions in Threat Model**: The threat model assumes that defenders have access to a dataset of clean and trojaned networks generated using the same method as the attacker, albeit with random triggers and target labels. While this assumption facilitates the evaluation of detection difficulty, it may not fully capture real-world scenarios where attackers might employ more sophisticated or varied strategies.

2. **Limited Exploration of Defense Mechanisms**: While the paper focuses on evading existing detectors, it does not delve deeply into potential new defense strategies that could counteract such evasive trojans. Exploring or proposing enhancements to detection methods in light of these findings could provide a more balanced perspective.

3. **Scalability and Computational Overhead**: The approach involves training a large number of models (over 6,000), which raises questions about the scalability and computational resources required for both attack and defense. Discussing the practical feasibility and potential optimizations would enhance the paper's applicability.

4. **Impact on Different Architectures**: Although the paper covers various datasets and some different architectures (e.g., Wide ResNets, Vision Transformers), a more detailed analysis of how different network architectures influence the efficacy of evasive trojans could provide deeper insights.

5. **Ethical Considerations**: The paper does not discuss the ethical implications of developing more potent trojan attacks, even within a research context. Addressing the responsible disclosure and potential misuse of such methods would strengthen the paper's alignment with ethical research practices.

**Suggestions for Improvement**

1. **Broaden Threat Model Discussion**: Expand the discussion on the threat model to consider scenarios where attackers might use heterogeneous methods for trojan insertion, beyond the fixed distribution assumed. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's limitations and robustness.

2. **Propose Enhanced Defense Mechanisms**: In addition to highlighting the vulnerabilities, the paper could propose preliminary ideas or frameworks for developing more resilient detection methods that could counteract such evasive trojans.

3. **Analyze Computational Requirements**: Provide an analysis of the computational resources and time required to train the evasive trojans. Discussing potential optimizations or alternatives could make the approach more feasible for broader adoption or further research.

4. **Detailed Architecture Impact Study**: Conduct a more granular study on how different neural network architectures respond to the addition of evasive trojans. This could uncover architecture-specific vulnerabilities or strengths.

5. **Ethical Framework Integration**: Incorporate a section on the ethical considerations of developing and publishing methods for creating more evasive trojans. Outlining guidelines for responsible research and potential safeguards would demonstrate a commitment to ethical standards.

**Conclusion**

The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of neural network security by unveiling the potential for designing trojans that are highly evasive against a broad range of detection mechanisms. The methodological rigor, extensive experimentation, and unexpected findings offer valuable insights into the vulnerabilities of current defense strategies. Addressing the highlighted weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements could further bolster the paper's impact and applicability. Overall, this work is a noteworthy advancement in understanding and challenging the resilience of trojan detection in deep neural networks.
