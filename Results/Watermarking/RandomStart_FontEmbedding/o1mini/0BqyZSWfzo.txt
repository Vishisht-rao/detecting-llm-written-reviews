OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the key topic of privacy estimation in federated learning (FL) by introducing a novel "one-shot" empirical privacy estimation method tailored for differentially private (DP) FL systems. The authors identify significant limitations in existing privacy auditing techniques, particularly their reliance on strong adversarial assumptions, task-specific tailoring, and the impractical requirement of retraining models multiple times. To overcome these challenges, the paper presents an innovative approach that integrates privacy estimation seamlessly into a single training run, thereby enhancing scalability and practicality for large-scale FL deployments.

**Key Contributions:**

1. **One-Shot Privacy Estimation Method:** The primary contribution is the development of a one-shot empirical privacy estimation technique that operates within the same training run used to optimize model parameters. This eliminates the need for repetitive retraining, significantly reducing computational overhead and time, which is particularly beneficial for FL scenarios involving extensive training periods.

2. **Model and Task Agnosticism:** The proposed method does not require prior knowledge of the model architecture, training task, or the specifics of the DP algorithm employed. This generality ensures broad applicability across diverse FL applications, from speech and image recognition to language modeling.

3. **Theoretical Guarantees:** The authors provide rigorous theoretical underpinnings for their method, demonstrating that it offers provably correct privacy loss estimates under the Gaussian mechanism in high-dimensional settings. The asymptotic Gaussianity of cosine statistics is a pivotal aspect of their theoretical framework.

4. **Empirical Validation:** The paper includes comprehensive experiments on established FL benchmark datasets, such as StackOverflow word prediction and EMNIST character recognition. These experiments validate the effectiveness of the method across various noise levels and adversarial threat models, showcasing its robustness and reliability.

5. **Comparison with Existing Methods:** The authors conduct a thorough empirical comparison with the CANIFE method, highlighting the superior generality and accuracy of their approach. They demonstrate that their method provides higher and more plausible privacy estimates in scenarios where CANIFE underestimates privacy loss.

**Strengths:**

- **Scalability and Efficiency:** By integrating privacy estimation into a single training run, the method is highly scalable and efficient, making it suitable for real-world FL systems with millions of parameters and hundreds of thousands of clients.

- **Minimal Impact on Model Utility:** The introduction of random canary clients has a negligible effect on model accuracy, as evidenced by the experiments. This ensures that privacy auditing does not compromise the primary objective of model performance.

- **Theoretical Rigor:** The paper offers a solid theoretical foundation, with detailed proofs and propositions that validate the method's correctness. The asymptotic analysis and convergence results add significant credibility to the approach.

- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Multiple facets of the method's performance are evaluated, including its behavior under different noise multipliers and client participation patterns. The inclusion of supplementary experiments on additional datasets like EMNIST strengthens the empirical evidence.

**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**

- **Limited Adversarial Models:** While the paper discusses several adversarial threat models, exploring a broader range of scenarios, including adaptive and more sophisticated attackers, could provide deeper insights into the method's robustness.

- **Assumption of High Dimensionality:** The theoretical guarantees rely on high-dimensional settings where cosine statistics approximate Gaussian distributions. Investigating the method's performance in lower-dimensional scenarios or providing extensions to handle such cases would enhance its versatility.

- **Practical Deployment Considerations:** Although the method is designed for scalability, discussing practical aspects of deploying this technique in real-world FL systems, such as integration with existing FL frameworks and handling asynchronous client participation, would be beneficial.

**Comparison to Related Works:**

The paper effectively positions its contributions relative to existing privacy auditing techniques, particularly highlighting the limitations of methods like CANIFE. By addressing the scalability and generality issues inherent in previous approaches, the proposed method stands out as a significant advancement in the field. The empirical comparisons underscore the method’s superiority in providing accurate and feasible privacy estimates without stringent assumptions about the adversary or the FL setup.

**Clarity and Presentation:**

The paper is well-structured and clearly articulates both the motivation and the methodology behind the one-shot privacy estimation technique. The inclusion of detailed algorithms, theoretical propositions, and comprehensive experimental results contributes to the paper’s clarity. However, certain sections, particularly the theoretical proofs and supplementary material, could be streamlined or supplemented with intuitive explanations to enhance accessibility for a broader audience.

**Significance and Potential Impact:**

This work addresses a critical need in the deployment of privacy-preserving FL systems. By enabling efficient and accurate privacy estimation without incurring significant computational costs or requiring extensive prior knowledge, the method has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of DP in FL. Its applicability across various model architectures and tasks makes it a valuable tool for practitioners aiming to balance privacy guarantees with model performance.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, this paper makes a substantial contribution to the domain of privacy estimation in federated learning. Its innovative one-shot approach, backed by solid theoretical foundations and validated through extensive experiments, offers a practical solution to the scalability and generality challenges faced by existing privacy auditing methods. Addressing the noted weaknesses in future work could further enhance the method’s applicability and robustness, solidifying its place as a cornerstone in privacy-preserving machine learning.
