OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the key topic of optimizing machine learning model configurations under multiple risk constraints by introducing a novel framework that synergistically combines Bayesian Optimization (BO) with rigorous statistical risk-controlling procedures. The authors present a method that efficiently navigates the hyperparameter space to identify Pareto optimal configurations within a predefined region of interest, ensuring that selected models adhere to user-specified risk limits while optimizing for other conflicting performance metrics such as accuracy, fairness, robustness, and computational cost.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Integration of BO and Risk Control:** The paper effectively bridges the gap between efficient hyperparameter optimization and rigorous risk control. By defining a region of interest in the objective space and tailoring the BO procedure to focus on this region, the authors enhance both computational and statistical efficiency.

2. **Comprehensive Theoretical Foundation:** The methodology is grounded in solid theoretical principles, leveraging concentration inequalities like Hoeffding’s to derive valid p-values and ensuring finite-sample guarantees for risk control. The formal theorem (Theorem 5.1) provides a clear assurance of the method's validity under specified conditions.

3. **Broad Applicability:** The proposed framework is demonstrated across a diverse set of applications, including classification fairness, robustness to spurious correlations, variational autoencoders, and transformer model pruning. This versatility underscores the method's generalizability and practical relevance.

4. **Empirical Validation:** The experimental results convincingly show that the proposed method outperforms existing baselines in identifying efficient and validated configurations within limited budgets. The inclusion of various datasets and tasks strengthens the empirical claims.

5. **Clear Presentation and Structure:** The paper is well-organized, with detailed explanations of the problem formulation, related work, methodological contributions, and experimental setups. Appendices provide additional insights and proofs, enhancing the paper's transparency and reproducibility.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Scalability Considerations:** While the method is shown to be effective for the tasks presented, the scalability to extremely high-dimensional hyperparameter spaces or more complex models (beyond transformer pruning) is not extensively explored. Future work could address how the method performs as the dimensionality and complexity of the configuration space increase.

2. **Assumptions on Loss Functions:** The derivation of p-values relies on the assumption that loss functions are bounded, which may not hold for all types of objectives. It would be beneficial to discuss the method's applicability or necessary adjustments for unbounded or heavily skewed loss distributions.

3. **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters δ and δ′:** Although Appendix C.6 suggests that the method is generally insensitive to the choice of δ′, a more thorough analysis or guidelines on selecting these hyperparameters in different scenarios could enhance the method's usability.

4. **Comparison with More Baselines:** While the method is compared against several baselines, including uniform and random sampling as well as standard BO approaches, comparisons with more recent or advanced multi-objective optimization techniques could provide deeper insights into the relative performance and advantages of the proposed method.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Extended Experimentation:** Incorporating additional experiments that test the method's limits, such as higher-dimensional hyperparameter spaces or real-world large-scale applications, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of its robustness and scalability.

2. **Discussion on Computational Overhead:** While the paper emphasizes computational efficiency, a detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the guided BO and the region of interest definition would be valuable. This includes runtime comparisons with baseline methods.

3. **User Guidelines for Region of Interest:** Providing more explicit guidelines or automated ways to define the region of interest based on different types of constraints and risk levels could make the method more accessible to practitioners who may not have deep expertise in statistical risk control.

4. **Inclusion of Diverse Metrics:** Exploring a wider variety of performance metrics, including those that are non-differentiable or more nuanced in nature, could demonstrate the method's flexibility and expand its applicability to other domains.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, this paper presents a significant advancement in the field of hyperparameter optimization under risk constraints. By effectively integrating Bayesian Optimization with statistical testing frameworks, the proposed method offers a robust and efficient approach to selecting model configurations that meet stringent performance and risk criteria. The theoretical rigor, combined with practical demonstrations across diverse tasks, makes this work a valuable contribution to both academic research and practical machine learning model deployment.
