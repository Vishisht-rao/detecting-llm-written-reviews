This paper addresses the key topic of high-framerate human motion synthesis by introducing NeRM, a novel generative model that leverages Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) to efficiently generate realistic human motions at arbitrary framerates. Published at ICLR 2024, the authors Dong Wei et al. tackle the significant challenges associated with varied framerates in training data, substantial memory demands, and the slow sampling speeds of existing generative models. By optimizing latent representations through an auto-decoder conditioned on temporal coordinates, NeRM effectively captures the variational distribution of motions, thereby preserving high-frequency details and enabling flexible framerate generation without the need for extensive pre-processing.

One of the standout contributions of this work is the two-stage pipeline that first learns a continuous motion field using variational INRs and then models the distribution of these latent codes with a diffusion model. This approach not only circumvents the limitations of fixed-framerate training prevalent in current methods but also maintains memory efficiency and achieves significant speed-ups in inference time. The introduction of the clip-FID metric further demonstrates the modelâ€™s ability to preserve high-framerate details, offering a more nuanced evaluation of motion realism compared to traditional FID metrics.

The experimental evaluation of NeRM is comprehensive, covering multiple datasets such as HumanML3D, KIT, UESTC, and HumanAct12. The results indicate that NeRM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of Frechet Inception Distance (FID), R-Precision, Diversity, and the newly proposed clip-FID. Additionally, user studies corroborate the quantitative findings, highlighting the superior realism and consistency of motions generated by NeRM compared to existing models like MLD and MDM. The ability to generate motions at high framerates (up to 120 fps) without compromising on quality or efficiency is particularly noteworthy, addressing a crucial gap in the current motion synthesis landscape.

Despite its strengths, the paper acknowledges several limitations, including the dependence on high-framerate data for optimal performance and the computational demands during the training phase. Future work is suggested to integrate fine-grained internal conditions and explore more diverse motion patterns beyond the highest framerates available in training datasets. Additionally, extending NeRM to accommodate varying body shapes and integrating it with models that handle skinned articulated objects could further enhance its applicability and robustness.

In conclusion, NeRM presents a significant advancement in the field of human motion synthesis by effectively combining INRs with diffusion models to achieve high-quality, high-framerate motion generation. Its innovative approach to handling varied framerates and efficient latent space modeling sets a new benchmark, demonstrating both technical excellence and practical relevance. This work is poised to influence future research directions, particularly in applications requiring highly detailed and adaptable motion generation, such as gaming, virtual reality, and robotics.
