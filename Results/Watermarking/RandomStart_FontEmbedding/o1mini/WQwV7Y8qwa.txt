**Review of "Modeling state-dependent communication between brain regions with switching nonlinear dynamical systems"**

This paper addresses the key topic of understanding multi-region neural interactions underlying behavior by introducing a novel modeling framework called Multi-Region Switching Dynamical Systems (MR-SDS). The authors aim to capture the complex, state-dependent communication between different brain regions, accounting for nonlinear and non-stationary neural dynamics. By leveraging a switching nonlinear state space model, MR-SDS decomposes neural activity into local and cross-region components, providing insights into directed communication signals and the effects of sensory inputs.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Modeling Approach:** The introduction of MR-SDS represents a significant advancement in modeling multi-region neural data. By integrating switching nonlinear dynamics with directed interactions between regions, the model captures the complexity of brain-wide interactions more effectively than existing methods.

2. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The authors validate their approach through extensive simulations and applications to real neural datasets. The simulations, including the Lotka-Volterra and decision-making tasks, demonstrate the model's ability to recover latent trajectories and communication profiles accurately. Application to both single-cell-resolution mesoscope data and mesoscale widefield data further showcases MR-SDS's versatility and robustness.

3. **Performance Improvements:** MR-SDS outperforms existing models, such as multi-region recurrent switching linear models (mr-rSLDS) and other latent variable models like LFADS, in both simulation and real-data scenarios. Notably, MR-SDS achieves lower cosmoothing test errors, indicating superior generalization and predictive capabilities.

4. **Interpretability:** By decomposing neural dynamics into region-specific and communication components, MR-SDS enhances the interpretability of neural interactions. The ability to quantify and decode information flows between regions provides valuable insights into the neural basis of behavior.

5. **Technical Rigor:** The methodological framework, including the use of Transformer encoders for posterior inference and the introduction of measures like communication volume, is well-articulated. The paper also addresses potential challenges, such as posterior collapse, and implements strategies like beta upweighting and overshooting to mitigate them.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity of the Model:** While MR-SDS offers enhanced modeling capabilities, its complexity might pose challenges for scalability, especially with an increasing number of brain regions or neurons. The reliance on Transformer architectures, which are computationally intensive, could limit the model's applicability to very large datasets without substantial computational resources.

2. **Assumptions in Model Structure:** The model assumes that each brain region's activity can be decomposed into distinct local and communication components. While this is a reasonable assumption, it may not capture all the nuances of neural interactions, especially in highly interconnected or overlapping functional regions.

3. **Limited Exploration of Hyperparameters:** Although the paper provides some insights into hyperparameter sweeps, a more exhaustive exploration or sensitivity analysis could strengthen the claims regarding the model's robustness and generalizability across different settings and datasets.

4. **Causality Concerns:** The authors acknowledge that learned interactions in MR-SDS are not causal. Future extensions incorporating causal inference could enhance the model's utility in understanding directional influences and underlying mechanisms in neural circuits.

5. **Comparison with More Baselines:** While the model is compared against several state-of-the-art approaches, including PCA-based and LDS-based models, comparisons with additional nonlinear and deep learning-based models could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of MR-SDS's performance.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of systems neuroscience by introducing a powerful and interpretable model for multi-region neural data. The MR-SDS framework effectively captures state-dependent communication and nonlinear dynamics, outperforming existing methods in both simulations and real-world datasets. Despite some challenges related to model complexity and assumptions, the strengths of MR-SDS in enhancing our understanding of brain-wide interactions make it a valuable tool for future neuroscientific research. The methodological rigor and comprehensive evaluations further underscore the model's potential impact. I recommend acceptance of this paper for its innovative approach and substantial advancements in modeling neural dynamics.
