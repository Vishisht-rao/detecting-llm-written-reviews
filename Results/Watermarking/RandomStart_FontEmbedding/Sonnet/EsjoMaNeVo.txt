OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the key issue of steering no-regret learning agents toward optimal equilibria in games through the use of incentive payments. Here is my detailed review:

Strengths:
1. Novel Contribution: The paper makes significant theoretical advances in understanding how to guide agents to desirable equilibria while only assuming sublinear regret, which is a weaker assumption than full rationality. The impossibility results and algorithmic solutions provide important insights into this problem.

2. Comprehensive Analysis: The authors examine both normal-form and extensive-form games, providing theoretical guarantees and impossibility results for different feedback settings (full vs bandit). The analysis is thorough and mathematically rigorous.

3. Practical Relevance: The steering problem studied has important applications in mechanism design and multi-agent systems. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can work effectively in practice.

4. Clear Organization: The paper is well-structured, building from simpler settings (normal-form games) to more complex ones (extensive-form games with bandit feedback). The progression helps readers understand the key challenges.

Weaknesses:
1. Technical Density: The paper is quite technically dense and may be challenging for readers without a strong background in game theory and regret minimization. More intuitive explanations or examples could help accessibility.

2. Parameter Tuning: The theoretical results require careful tuning of multiple parameters (Î±, P, etc.). While this is justified mathematically, it may pose practical challenges in applications.

3. Experimental Evaluation: While the experiments demonstrate feasibility, a more comprehensive empirical evaluation comparing different approaches and parameter settings would strengthen the practical contributions.

4. Computational Complexity: The paper could benefit from more discussion of the computational requirements of the proposed algorithms, especially for large games.

Impact and Recommendations:
This is a strong paper that makes meaningful theoretical contributions to an important problem in game theory and mechanism design. The results bridge gaps between previous work and provide new insights into steering agents using minimal assumptions about rationality.

For revision, I recommend:
1. Adding more intuitive examples and explanations
2. Expanding the experimental evaluation
3. Including discussion of computational requirements
4. Clarifying practical implementation considerations

Overall, I believe this paper deserves acceptance as it advances our understanding of how to guide strategic agents toward optimal outcomes using incentives.
