Paper ID: Tr3fZocrI6
OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the key issue of learning shared representations across multiple tasks when the underlying data may be non-independent and non-isotropically distributed - an important challenge that prior work has not fully addressed.

Strengths:
- The paper makes significant theoretical contributions by providing convergence guarantees for representation learning in a more general setting that allows for non-iid and non-isotropic data
- The proposed De-bias & Feature-Whiten (DFW) algorithm provides practical modifications to existing methods that demonstrably improve performance
- The theoretical analysis unifies and extends previous work while relaxing common restrictive assumptions about data distributions
- Strong empirical validation shows the algorithm outperforms baselines, especially in challenging scenarios with non-isotropic data
- The framework has broad applicability, including important applications in control and dynamical systems

Weaknesses:
- The initialization requirements for the algorithm are not fully addressed, though the authors acknowledge this limitation
- Some of the theoretical assumptions and analysis may be difficult for practitioners to verify in real applications
- The empirical evaluation could benefit from more diverse real-world datasets/applications

The key contribution is showing how to modify existing alternating minimization-descent approaches to handle non-iid, non-isotropic data while maintaining favorable convergence rates that scale with the total amount of data across tasks. The theoretical guarantees and empirical results convincingly demonstrate that the proposed DFW algorithm provides significant advantages over previous methods in these more general settings.

The paper is technically sound and well-written, with clear explanations of both the theoretical developments and practical algorithmic considerations. The experimental results effectively validate the theoretical claims and demonstrate concrete benefits of the proposed approach.

Recommendation: Accept. This paper makes important theoretical and practical contributions to multi-task representation learning by addressing fundamental limitations of existing approaches. The results should be valuable to both theoreticians and practitioners working on representation learning and related applications.

Impact: The theoretical framework and practical algorithm developed here could have broad impact across applications requiring representation learning from heterogeneous data sources, particularly in areas like control systems and federated learning where data is naturally non-iid and non-isotropic.
