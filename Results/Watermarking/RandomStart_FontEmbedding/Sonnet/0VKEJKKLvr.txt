OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the key issue of breast cancer risk prediction using genetic data through a novel graph-based representation learning approach. Here is my detailed review:

Strengths:
1. Novel Methodology: The paper introduces an innovative ensemble-based feature selection approach combined with graph-based representation learning for analyzing genetic variants. This addresses the critical challenge of handling high-dimensional genetic data.

2. Strong Technical Approach:
- The ensemble method intelligently combines multiple feature selection techniques using harmonic mean
- The graph construction approach using hamming distance is well-justified and effective
- Comprehensive evaluation using multiple graph neural network architectures (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE)

3. Robust Evaluation:
- Extensive experiments comparing against traditional ML methods
- Clear performance improvements (GCN achieves AUC of 0.986 vs 0.955 for XGBoost)
- Proper validation using nested cross-validation and internal test set
- Detailed ablation studies on feature selection methods and model components

4. Clear Practical Impact:
- Addresses a significant healthcare problem with 2.3M new breast cancer cases annually
- Shows potential for improved personalized risk assessment
- Uses real clinical data from Biobank of Eastern Finland

Limitations:
1. Dataset Bias: The study uses data only from Finnish population, which may limit generalizability to other populations (though authors acknowledge this)

2. Limited Biological Interpretation: While the model performs well, there could be more discussion on biological relevance of selected SNPs

3. Computational Requirements: The paper could benefit from discussing computational costs and scalability of the approach

4. Comparison Scope: Could include comparisons with existing specialized breast cancer risk prediction models from medical literature

Suggestions:
1. Include analysis of biological pathways associated with selected SNPs
2. Add runtime/computational complexity analysis
3. Expand validation to diverse population datasets
4. Compare with clinical risk prediction tools

Overall Assessment:
This is a strong paper that makes significant contributions to both machine learning methodology and healthcare applications. The technical approach is sound and well-validated, showing meaningful improvements over existing methods. The work has clear practical relevance while advancing the state-of-the-art in genomic data analysis.

Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions to address the suggested improvements.

Impact: High - Both methodological innovation and healthcare application potential.
