Paper ID: NFaFvyKKbX
OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the key issue of quantifying and understanding non-linearity in deep neural networks through a novel theoretical framework called the "affinity score." Here is my detailed review:

Strengths:
1. Novel Contribution: The paper introduces a theoretically sound way to measure non-linearity in neural networks using optimal transport theory. This fills an important gap in our understanding of how non-linearity propagates through deep networks.

2. Comprehensive Analysis: The authors provide extensive experimental validation across multiple popular architectures (from AlexNet to Vision Transformers), offering valuable insights into how different architectural choices affect non-linearity propagation.

3. Theoretical Foundation: The affinity score is well-grounded in optimal transport theory with clear mathematical properties and guarantees. The authors provide rigorous proofs and theoretical analysis.

4. Practical Utility: The proposed metric correlates well with model performance on ImageNet and provides actionable insights for architecture design. The experiments show how different design choices (skip connections, inception modules, etc.) impact non-linearity.

5. Novel Findings: The work reveals several interesting insights, such as how Vision Transformers achieve higher non-linearity than CNNs and how different activation functions behave across network depths.

Weaknesses:
1. Limited Scope: The analysis focuses mainly on computer vision models. Extension to other domains like NLP or audio processing would strengthen the paper's impact.

2. Computational Complexity: While the paper discusses some implementation details, a more thorough analysis of the computational overhead of calculating the affinity score would be helpful.

3. Practical Guidelines: While the paper provides excellent analysis, it could benefit from more concrete guidelines for practitioners on how to use these insights for architecture design.

Minor Comments:
- The paper would benefit from more ablation studies on how different hyperparameters affect the affinity score
- Some figures could be made clearer with better labeling and explanation
- The connection between affinity score and model robustness could be explored

Overall Assessment:
This is a strong paper that makes both theoretical and practical contributions to our understanding of deep neural networks. The affinity score provides a novel lens through which to analyze and understand network architectures. The comprehensive empirical validation and clear theoretical foundations make this work valuable for both researchers and practitioners. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
