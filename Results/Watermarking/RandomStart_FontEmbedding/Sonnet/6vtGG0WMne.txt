OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the key issue of handling imbalanced data in deep learning models while considering application-specific requirements for the degree of imbalance.

Strengths:
1. Novel Contribution: The paper introduces an innovative approach by formally defining model imbalance state (MIS) and proposing a bias adjustment (BA) method that can efficiently optimize models to achieve desired imbalance states based on application requirements.

2. Practical Applicability: The method addresses a real-world challenge where different applications may require different degrees of imbalance rather than just balanced models. The examples of financial fraud detection and customer complaints recognition effectively illustrate this need.

3. Efficiency: The proposed BA method is computationally efficient as it only adjusts the bias in the last layer rather than requiring extensive parameter tuning or retraining. The experimental results show significant time savings compared to traditional class-weighting approaches.

4. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper presents extensive experiments across multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, SST-2, AG) and metrics (accuracy, F1-score, G-means), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Weaknesses:
1. Limited Scope: The experiments focus primarily on binary classification problems. The generalization to multi-class imbalanced scenarios is not thoroughly explored.

2. Theoretical Foundation: While the method is empirically effective, the theoretical justification for why adjusting only the bias term is sufficient could be strengthened.

3. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of how sensitive the method is to the choice of learning rate for the BA optimization.

4. Application Guidelines: More concrete guidelines for practitioners on how to select appropriate target imbalance states for different applications would be valuable.

Recommendations:
1. Extend the evaluation to multi-class imbalance scenarios
2. Provide stronger theoretical analysis of the BA method
3. Include sensitivity analysis for key hyperparameters
4. Add practical guidelines for selecting target imbalance states

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes a valuable contribution to handling imbalanced data in deep learning. The proposed method is both novel and practical, addressing a real need in applications where balanced models may not be optimal. The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the approach.
