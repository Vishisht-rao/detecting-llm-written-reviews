OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the key issue of uncertainty quantification in similarity scoring systems, particularly focusing on face recognition (FR) applications where both performance and fairness assessments are crucial.

Key strengths:
1. Novel Contribution: The paper introduces a robust method for quantifying uncertainty in ROC curve estimation for similarity scoring, specifically addressing the challenges posed by U-statistics in face recognition systems.

2. Theoretical Foundation: The authors provide strong theoretical backing with formal proofs of asymptotic guarantees for empirical ROC curves and fairness metrics.

3. Practical Application: The research demonstrates real-world applicability through experiments using actual face image datasets, showing how their recentered bootstrap method improves upon naive bootstrap approaches.

4. Fairness Consideration: The work thoughtfully incorporates fairness metrics and their uncertainty quantification, which is especially relevant given growing concerns about bias in FR systems.

Main contributions:
- Development of a recentered bootstrap technique that overcomes the limitations of naive bootstrap methods
- Theoretical framework for assessing uncertainty in both performance and fairness metrics
- Empirical validation showing the max-geomean metric as most robust for fairness evaluation

Limitations:
1. The paper focuses primarily on traditional ROC analysis and may benefit from exploring other performance metrics.

2. While synthetic data experiments are included, more extensive real-world testing across diverse datasets could strengthen the findings.

3. The computational complexity of the proposed methods is not thoroughly discussed.

Suggested improvements:
1. Include runtime analysis and computational requirements for the proposed methods

2. Expand the evaluation to include more diverse face recognition datasets

3. Provide more detailed guidelines for practitioners implementing these uncertainty quantification methods

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes significant contributions to both the theoretical understanding and practical application of uncertainty quantification in similarity scoring systems. The work is particularly valuable for the face recognition community, where reliable performance and fairness assessments are increasingly important.
