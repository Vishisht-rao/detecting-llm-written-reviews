### Review of "TOWARDS ZERO MEMORY FOOTPRINT SPIKING NEURAL NETWORK TRAINING"

#### Summary:
The manuscript presents an innovative framework for training Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that aims to address the considerable memory requirements traditionally associated with these networks. The authors propose a reversible spiking neuron architecture capable of achieving substantial memory savings (a reported 58.65× reduction) by recalculating intermediate values during backward propagation instead of storing them. Furthermore, a unique algorithm is introduced to streamline backpropagation in this reversible architecture, leading to a reduction in training time by 23.8%. The empirical evaluations claim significant improvements in both memory efficiency and training speed while maintaining high accuracy across various datasets.

#### Strengths:
1. **Relevance**: The paper addresses a critical issue in deploying SNNs in resource-limited environments, making it especially relevant for applications in neuromorphic computing and IoT-Edge devices.
  
2. **Innovative Approach**: The design of a reversible spiking neuron that minimizes memory usage while retaining performance represents a notable advance in the field. The concept of on-the-fly computation of intermediate states is promising and could inspire future work.

3. **Evaluation**: The authors provide extensive experimental results across multiple datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, DVS-CIFAR10, and DVS128-Gesture), presenting comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. The reductions in memory use and FLOPs, as well as the training time improvements, are straightforward and well-illustrated.

4. **Robust Methodology**: The use of an ablation study and detailed hyperparameter analysis adds rigor to the validation of their claims, ensuring that their conclusions are well-supported.

#### Weaknesses:
1. **Clarity and Organization**: The manuscript would benefit from a clearer articulation of its main findings in the abstract and introduction. The technical jargon and dense presentation may hinder accessibility for a wider audience.

2. **Complexity of Results**: While the memory reductions and training speedups are impressive, the paper could improve transparency by providing additional metrics and practical implications. For instance, discussing potential trade-offs in terms of accuracy or applicability in real-world scenarios would enhance the reader's understanding of the framework's overall impact.

3. **Implementation Details**: While the theoretical foundation is solid, more specifics regarding implementation (e.g., how the architecture integrates into existing frameworks, compatibility with various hardware setups) would be valuable for practitioners looking to adopt this method.

4. **Comparative Context**: The discussion around existing memory-efficient techniques is extensive, but it would be beneficial to map out a clear landscape comparing this approach's advantages and disadvantages relative to its competitors.

#### Suggestions for Improvement:
- **Enhance Visuals**: Graphical representations of the reversible architecture and backpropagation process would greatly aid comprehension.
  
- **Broaden Comparison**: Include a more comprehensive comparison with existing methods, potentially providing insights into scenarios where the proposed method might not be optimal.

- **Address Limitations**: The authors could elaborate on situations where the proposed architecture might still face challenges or limitations, such as in real-time applications where memory and processing speed are pivotal.

- **Clarify Terminology**: Revising sections with technical terminology to be more reader-friendly can help in reaching a broader audience.

#### Conclusion:
This paper presents a commendable approach to mitigating the high memory footprint of SNN training, which stands to benefit numerous applications within the field of machine learning and neuromorphic computing. While the innovations and experimental validations are impressive, enhancing clarity and broadening the scope of context will significantly bolster the impact of this research. The work is poised to contribute valuable insights into the design of efficient neural networks and deserves consideration for acceptance with minor revisions.This paper addresses the key issue of high memory consumption during the training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), a growing area of research within neuromorphic computing that seeks to emulate biological brain function. The authors propose a novel framework featuring a reversible spiking neuron designed to significantly reduce the memory footprint associated with SNN training. 

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach:** The introduction of a reversible spiking neuron marks a significant advancement in the efficiency of SNN training methodologies. The authors provide a compelling rationale and theoretical justification for their model, indicating a thorough understanding of the limitations of existing methods.

2. **Empirical Results:** The experimental evaluations presented showcase the substantial memory reductions achieved with the proposed model in comparison to state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques. Specifically, the claimed reductions of 58.65× in memory usage for the CIFAR10 dataset and other comparative results across different datasets highlight the practical implications of this research.

3. **Detailed Analysis:** The paper provides comprehensive backpropagation analysis, clearly outlining the improvements made over traditional methods and their computational overhead. The contribution of a new inverse gradient calculation technique for SNNs that lowers the number of FLOPs during training is particularly noteworthy.

4. **Widespread Applicability:** The results suggest that the proposed reversible spiking neuron can be integrated effectively with existing SNN architectures, thereby enhancing their efficiency while maintaining performance.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity of Implementation:** While the theoretical framework is well-articulated, the practical implementation details of the reversible spiking neuron could be elaborated further. For instance, the algorithm's complexity and its integration into various SNN architectures may pose challenges for practitioners, and a more in-depth discussion of these aspects would be beneficial.

2. **Limited Scope of Datasets:** The experimental results rely on a select number of datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, DVS-CIFAR10, DVS128-Gesture). While these are widely used benchmarks, examining the performance on a broader variety of datasets, particularly those requiring real-time processing or other application-specific datasets, would strengthen the findings.

3. **Comparative Analysis with Alternative Techniques:** Although the paper compares its results against several SOTA methods, there is potential for including a more robust comparative analysis against newer or emerging techniques in the field of SNNs or other neural network architectures that may directly compete with the proposed approach.

4. **Theoretical Limitations:** The paper would benefit from a more explicit discussion on any theoretical limitations or potential pitfalls of the reversible spiking neuron framework. Understanding conditions under which performance might degrade could provide insights for future research.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, this paper presents a critical advancement in building memory-efficient SNNs, making significant strides towards practical deployments in resource-limited settings, such as IoT devices. The contributions have the potential to invigorate ongoing research in the area, pushing the boundaries of what is presently achievable with SNN architectures. Addressing the noted weaknesses would further solidify the robustness and applicability of the proposed methodology in real-world scenarios.
