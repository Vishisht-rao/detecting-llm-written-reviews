OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the key issue of implicit bias in optimization algorithms, specifically focusing on the Adam and RMSProp algorithms. By employing backward error analysis, the authors aim to uncover how these adaptive optimizers behave in terms of implicit regularization and how their hyperparameters influence generalization capabilities.

The abstract clearly outlines the main contributions of the paper, noting the dual nature of the implicit bias involving either the one-norm or a hindrance to the decrease of the one-norm depending on the specific conditions set by the hyperparameters. The authors effectively fill a significant gap in the literature, as prior analysis on backward error correction has mostly centered around gradient descent and its variants, while limited attention was given to adaptive methods like Adam and RMSProp.

### Strengths:
1. **Novel Contribution**: The paper provides a new perspective on the implicit bias associated with Adam and RMSProp, which is an important area of research given the prevalence of these algorithms in practice.

2. **Theoretical Rigor**: The authors present comprehensive theoretical analysis, including the derivation of the modified ODEs approximating the trajectories of the Adam and RMSProp algorithms, supporting their findings with theorems and detailed proofs.

3. **Numerical Evidence**: The experimental sections provide numerical evidence that corroborate their theoretical claims. The experiments illustrate how varying the hyperparameters affects the implicit regularization behavior of the algorithms, contributing to the paper's overall credibility.

4. **Clarity of Presentation**: The paper is well-organized, and the concepts are explained coherently, making it accessible even to those who may not have a deep background in numerical analysis.

### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Broader Context**: While the paper successfully positions itself within the existing literature, it could benefit from a more extensive discussion of how the findings relate to other recent works. The manuscript could clarify how the identified biases of Adam and RMSProp specifically contrast with traditional GD or other variants.

2. **Empirical Methodology**: The numerical experiments provide initial insights, but a more thorough investigation into different datasets or larger architectures could help validate the robustness of the findings. In particular, examining how the biases manifest across diverse problem domains could enhance the paper's applicability.

3. **Interpretation of Results**: Some of the later sections could be more explicit about the implications of the findings. While the authors propose connections between the identified biases and generalization, it would be beneficial to discuss this potential link in greater detail, especially regarding practical implementations.

4. **Future Directions**: The section on future research is brief. A more in-depth exploration of potential avenues for expanding the analysis, particularly how these findings could impact future algorithm designs, would improve the manuscript.

In summary, this work makes a significant contribution to understanding adaptive optimization algorithms, presenting new theoretical insights and empirical validation. With some refinements in broader context and empirical robustness, it could have a substantial impact on the field of machine learning optimization. Overall, I recommend acceptance of the paper with minor revisions.
