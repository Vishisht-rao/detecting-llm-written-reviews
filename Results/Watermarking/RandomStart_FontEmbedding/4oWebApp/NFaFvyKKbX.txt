OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the key issue of quantifying the non-linearity of deep neural networks (DNNs) and their activation functions, which has been largely overlooked in past research despite its crucial role in understanding the expressive power and performance of DNNs. The authors propose a novel metric called the "affinity score," derived from optimal transport theory, which measures the non-linearity of transformations in neural networks. They aim to evaluate and compare the non-linearity introduced by different activation functions within various architectures, particularly in the context of computer vision applications.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Contribution**: The introduction of the affinity score provides a theoretically grounded approach to measure non-linearity, which could significantly enhance our understanding of DNNs. This contribution could open new avenues for research into the design and optimization of activation functions.

2. **Theoretical Rigor**: The authors back their claims with strong mathematical foundations, utilizing optimal transport theory that is well-defined and established within the statistical and mathematical communities. The incorporation of relevant theorems strengthens the claims made about the affinity score's effectiveness and properties.

3. **Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation**: The paper includes extensive experiments across a variety of architectures, from AlexNet to vision transformers, providing convincing evidence of the practical utility of the affinity score. The results are presented clearly, demonstrating how the affinity score relates to performance and non-linearity propagation.

4. **Insight into Activation Functions**: By assessing different activation functions, the paper provides insights into their operational characteristics that relate to the underlying architecture. Such analysis is often missing in studies and could directly impact practitioners' choices when designing networks.

5. **Comparative Analysis**: The authors perform a comparative analysis of the affinity score with other metrics, illustrating its uniqueness and potential superiority in capturing the nuances of non-linearity in DNNs.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity and Accessibility**: While the theoretical aspects are a strength, they may also alienate readers who are not familiar with optimal transport theory. A more accessible introduction or summary of the key theoretical elements could expand the audience for this work.

2. **Limited Scope of Activation Functions Tested**: The experiments focus on a limited scope of activation functions. Broadening this evaluation to capture other modern activation functions could provide a more comprehensive understanding of non-linearity across various architectures.

3. **Practical Implications**: The paper discusses the implications of non-linearity on learning dynamics but lacks direct application insights for practitioners. It would benefit from a section outlining potential practical guidelines for selecting activation functions based on the affinity score.

4. **Quantitative Analysis of Results**: While qualitative observations are made regarding the non-linearity signature across different models, a more quantitative analysis could strengthen the analysis. For example, including statistical significance tests for the results could provide more robust conclusions.

5. **Comparison with State-of-the-Art Metrics**: Although the authors claim that the affinity score uniquely captures non-linearity, further benchmarking against existing metrics could bolster the credibility of their assertions.

**Conclusion**: Overall, this paper is a significant contribution to the field of deep learning, addressing an important gap in the understanding of DNNs through the lens of non-linearity. The proposed affinity score has the potential to become a pivotal tool for researchers and practitioners alike. However, additional work on expanding the scope of activation functions, enhancing accessibility, and providing practical implications would further improve the paper. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to enhance clarity and scope.
