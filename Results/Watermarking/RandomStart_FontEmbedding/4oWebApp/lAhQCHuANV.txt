OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the key issue of uncertainty assessment in the evaluation of similarity scoring functions, particularly in the context of face recognition (FR) systems. The authors provide a rigorous theoretical framework for understanding the statistical properties of empirical Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, particularly how these curves can exhibit uncertainty and variability. Given the societal implications of FR technologies, including issues of fairness across demographic groups, the work is both timely and critical.

**Strengths:**

1. **Theoretical Contributions**: The authors successfully articulate the limitations of existing methods for assessing uncertainty in ROC curves, particularly in light of the unique characteristics of similarity scoring tasks. By deriving asymptotic guarantees and establishing a consistent framework, they offer valuable insights that advance the state of knowledge in statistical learning theory.

2. **Methodological Innovations**: The proposed recentering technique for bootstrap methods is a significant advancement. The authors convincingly argue that naive applications of bootstrap methods can lead to serious underestimations of ROC curves and their associated confidence bands. Their novel approach addresses these drawbacks effectively.

3. **Practical Relevance**: The connection made between theory and practice is commendable. By applying these methods to empirical data from FR systems, the authors not only validate their theoretical assertions but also demonstrate practical implications, which is highly relevant to practitioners in the field.

4. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The use of multiple models and datasets (ArcFace, CosFace, AdaCos, MORPH) allows for a robust examination of the proposed techniques. The inclusion of diverse fairness metrics enriches the findings and provides a well-rounded analysis.

5. **Clarity in Presentation**: The paper is well-organized, and the complex statistical concepts are presented clearly. Diagrams and figures effectively illustrate key points, making the ideas more accessible to readers who may not have a strong background in statistical theory.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Discussion on Practical Implementation**: Despite the strong theoretical foundation, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion on the practical implementation challenges of the proposed methods. For instance, how readily applicable are the bootstrap techniques described in real-world FR systems? Discussing operationalizations would enhance the paper's utility for practitioners.

2. **Comparative Analysis**: The authors could further strengthen their position by incorporating comparisons with other existing methods of assessing performance and fairness in FR systems. A thorough comparison could help clarify the advantages and potential limitations of their approach relative to the current methodologies.

3. **Scalability Concerns**: While the paper effectively addresses the theoretical aspects of uncertainty quantification, it would be useful to discuss scalabilityâ€”specifically, how the proposed methods perform with larger datasets or in real-time applications, which are often constraints in FR tasks.

4. **Broader Implications**: The discussion surrounding fairness could also be expanded. While the paper touches on the importance of equitable performance across different demographic groups, more explicit examples of how these fairness considerations could impact the design and deployment of FR systems would be beneficial.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the area of face recognition and similarity scoring by systematically addressing uncertainty in performance evaluations. It creates a solid foundation for future research in this field and emphasizes the need to incorporate uncertainty measures into fairness evaluations. With some adjustments, particularly in practical suggestions and comparisons to existing methodologies, it could serve as an essential resource for both researchers and practitioners focused on developing responsible AI technologies. 

I recommend this paper for acceptance with minor revisions to address the points raised.
