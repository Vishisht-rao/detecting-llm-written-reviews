This paper addresses the key issue of steering no-regret learning agents toward optimal equilibria in games through the use of nonnegative payments. The authors provide a thorough exploration of both theoretical and practical aspects of this problem across different types of game structures, notably normal-form and extensive-form games. They present an impressive range of results, proving that steering agents is feasible under certain conditions and detailing the methodologies required to achieve this.

One of the primary strengths of the paper lies in its clear articulation of the theoretical context. The distinction between scenarios with finite total budgets and those that allow for vanishing average payments is compelling and well-supported by rigorous proofs. The authors correctly identify and elaborate on the limitations of previous studies, providing a valuable addition to the body of work in game theory and mechanism design.

The paper outlines several key results in a structured manner, distinguishing between conditions that permit steering and those that make it impossible. This systematic approach enhances the readability and comprehension of complex results. The authors highlight that while steering is generally impossible with constant payments in extensive-form games, it is achievable under certain conditions, such as with time-dependent payment structures or full feedback. 

Experimental results supplement the theoretical claims and showcase the applicability of the proposed algorithms. The implementation of steering algorithms using real-world benchmark games illustrates the method's effectiveness in practice, addressing an essential aspect of applied research â€” namely, that theoretical frameworks can lead to viable practical outcomes. 

On the downside, while the paper does a commendable job of presenting the algorithms and their theoretical underpinnings, it could benefit from a deeper discussion of potential limitations or challenges in real-world scenarios. For instance, the assumptions made about players' behavioral properties (such as the bounded regret) may not hold in all environments, which could lead to challenges in applying these results broadly. Further, while experimental results support the algorithms, additional real-world case studies or stress tests could further demonstrate reliability and robustness.

The paper has substantial merit, contributing significantly to the fields of game theory and machine learning. Its implications extend to mechanisms for design and information allocation. Overall, it opens avenues for further investigations into decentralized decision-making processes and the dynamics of learning in multi-agent systems.

In summary, this is a well-crafted paper that successfully blends theory with practical experiments. It demonstrates significant potential for advancing our understanding of equilibrium selection through incentivization in learning agents, while also raising pertinent questions for future research in this domain.
