This paper addresses the key issue of sample-efficient linear representation learning in the context of non-IID and non-isotropic data distributions. The authors propose a novel algorithm, De-bias & Feature-Whiten (DFW), that adapts existing approaches in alternating minimization-descent to effectively handle the challenges posed by heterogeneous source data in machine learning tasks. The motivation behind the work is well-articulated, drawing attention to the inefficiencies in current methods that assume isotropic and independent data, leading to suboptimal performance, especially in real-world applications where such assumptions often do not hold.

The paper offers significant theoretical contributions, including a detailed analysis of the biases introduced by conventional learning methods when confronted with noisy observations and non-IID data. The problem formulation is clearly presented, supporting the notion that existing methods fail to leverage the advantages of shared representation learning due to specific data distribution characteristics. The authors convincingly demonstrate that naive implementations can lead to increased sample complexity and reduced generalization capabilities, which is a valuable insight for both researchers and practitioners in the field.

The introduction of the DFW algorithm, which incorporates a de-biasing step and a feature-whitening mechanism, is a commendable approach towards mitigating the identified problems. The linear convergence guarantees and generalization bounds derived for DFW are significant accomplishments and lend credibility to the proposed framework. Furthermore, the experiments conducted are robust; they well illustrate the superiority of DFW against existing methods, showing its capabilities in both synthetic linear regression scenarios and more complex linear system identification tasks. The numerical results effectively highlight the improvements in sample efficiency and representational accuracy, further reinforcing the practical relevance of the algorithm.

However, there are a few areas where the paper could be strengthened. First, while the theoretical results are promising, a more in-depth discussion on how DFW can be initialized effectively in practice would enhance the paper. The mention that initialization is not directly addressed raises concerns regarding the practical applicability of the approach in real-world settings. Additionally, the authors briefly touch on extensions to nonlinear settings but do not provide concrete future directions or specific challenges this might present. A deeper exploration of these aspects could provide a more comprehensive view of the implications of the work.

Lastly, while the results presented are encouraging, the potential gap between theoretical performance and practical application in diverse settings is a notable concern. Real-world data often presents complexities and noise beyond what is modeled here; discussing how the algorithm might further adapt to those complexities would be a valuable addition.

In conclusion, this paper makes a significant contribution to the literature on representation learning from non-IID and non-isotropic data. The algorithm and theoretical guarantees presented have the potential to motivate future work in related areas, and the rigorous empirical evaluation adds to its strength. Addressing the noted feedback could elevate the impact and applicability of the proposed method even further.
