OUTPUT:
This paper tackles the intriguing problem of steering no-regret learners towards optimal equilibria in games using non-negative payments and advice. The authors systematically explore the feasibility of steering under different feedback and payment constraints, providing both positive algorithmic results and information-theoretic impossibility results.

**Strengths:**

* **Novel Problem Formulation:** The paper addresses a relevant and timely problem, bridging the gap between mechanism design and online learning in multi-agent systems. The focus on no-regret learners is particularly appealing, offering a more realistic behavioral model compared to perfect rationality assumptions.
* **Comprehensive Analysis:** The authors meticulously analyze the steering problem under different settings: normal-form vs. extensive-form games, full feedback vs. bandit feedback, and fixed equilibrium vs. online equilibrium computation. This comprehensive approach allows for a nuanced understanding of the trade-offs involved.
* **Strong Theoretical Results:**  The paper presents both positive and negative results. The positive results demonstrate the feasibility of steering under certain conditions (vanishing average payments, time-horizon dependent payments), while the negative results establish fundamental limitations (impossibility with bounded total payments, impossibility with bounded per-iteration payments in bandit extensive-form games).
* **Clear Presentation:** Despite the technical complexity, the paper is well-written and relatively easy to follow. The informal theorems provide a good high-level overview of the main results.
* **Experimental Validation:** The experimental results corroborate the theoretical findings, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in practice.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited Discussion on Computational Complexity:** While the paper presents algorithms for steering, a deeper discussion on their computational complexity would be beneficial. For instance, how does the complexity scale with the size of the game?
* **Practical Applicability:** The paper assumes the mediator knows the game and the regret bound of the players.  Relaxing these assumptions and exploring more realistic scenarios where the mediator has incomplete information would strengthen the paper's practical relevance.
* **Open Problems:** While the paper acknowledges some open problems, a more detailed discussion of future research directions, especially regarding online bandit steering in extensive-form games, would be appreciated.

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of multi-agent learning and mechanism design. The comprehensive theoretical analysis, coupled with experimental validation, provides a strong foundation for future research on steering no-regret learners. While some limitations exist, the paper's strengths clearly outweigh its weaknesses. I recommend accepting this paper.  Further investigation of the computational aspects, practical applicability, and the open problems identified would further enhance the impact of this work.
