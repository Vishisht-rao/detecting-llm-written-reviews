OUTPUT:
This paper tackles an important open question in optimization for deep learning: understanding the implicit regularization of adaptive methods like Adam and RMSProp. While backward error analysis has shed light on the implicit bias of GD, extending this analysis to adaptive methods has remained elusive. This paper makes significant strides in this direction.

**Strengths:**

* **Novel Contribution:** The paper derives an ODE approximating the mini-batch Adam trajectory up to second order in the step size, filling a critical gap in the literature. This ODE reveals a bias term distinct from GD's L2 regularization, instead involving a perturbed L1 norm of the loss gradients.
* **Insightful Analysis:** The analysis reveals how this bias term can either penalize or *hinder* the decrease of this perturbed L1 norm, depending on hyperparameters and training stage. This offers a potential explanation for the often-observed poorer generalization of adaptive methods compared to SGD. Specifically, the bias can act as anti-regularization when the squared gradient momentum parameter (rho) exceeds the gradient momentum parameter (beta).
* **Supporting Evidence:** Numerical experiments on image classification tasks with ResNets provide evidence consistent with the theoretical findings. The experiments show how varying the hyperparameters rho and beta influences the perturbed L1 norm and the test accuracy.
* **Clear Presentation:** Despite the technical complexity, the paper presents its results clearly, with an informal summary of the main theorem and illustrative examples. The appendix provides detailed proofs and additional experimental details, enhancing reproducibility.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited Scope of Experiments:** The numerical experiments are limited to image classification and a specific architecture (ResNets). More extensive experiments on other tasks and architectures would strengthen the empirical validation.
* **Edge Cases and Stability:** The analysis assumes bounded higher-order derivatives of the loss, which may not hold near optimality, particularly in the edge-of-stability regime often observed with large-batch training. The paper acknowledges this limitation and suggests further investigation. Similarly, the analysis doesn't fully address the unstable "spike" regime of Adam.
* **Connection to Generalization:** While the paper suggests a connection between the identified bias and generalization, this connection is not fully explored. Further research is needed to understand how manipulating the perturbed L1 norm directly impacts generalization performance.
* **Practical Implications:**  The paper doesn't delve into the practical implications of the findings. For example, how can practitioners adjust the Adam hyperparameters based on these insights to improve generalization?  Exploring specific strategies or heuristics would make the work more impactful.


**Overall:**

This paper presents valuable theoretical and empirical contributions to understanding the implicit regularization of Adam and RMSProp.  The identification of the bias term involving the perturbed L1 norm offers a novel perspective on the behavior of these optimizers and provides a potential explanation for their generalization properties.  While some limitations remain, the paper opens up promising avenues for future research and has the potential to influence how practitioners use and tune adaptive optimization methods.
