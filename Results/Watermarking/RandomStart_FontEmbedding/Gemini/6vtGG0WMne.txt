OUTPUT:
This paper presents a novel approach to address the challenge of imbalanced data in deep learning, moving beyond the conventional focus on balanced model training.  Instead, it proposes a method to regulate the model's imbalance to align with specific application metrics, which is a significant contribution.

**Strengths:**

* **Novel Approach:** The paper tackles the important, yet often overlooked, problem of application-specific imbalance requirements.  Existing methods primarily focus on balanced models, which may not be optimal for all real-world scenarios.
* **Formal Definition of MIS:** The introduction of Model Imbalance State (MIS) provides a quantifiable measure of model imbalance, allowing for more precise control and analysis.
* **Efficient BA Method:** The Bias Adjustment (BA) method offers an efficient way to optimize the model's imbalance by focusing on the last layer's bias.  This approach avoids the computational overhead of retraining the entire model.
* **Practical Training Strategy:** The proposed training strategy integrates BA into the standard training process, allowing for dynamic adjustment of MIS and potentially leading to the discovery of better representation parameters.
* **Strong Experimental Results:** The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method across various datasets and imbalance ratios, showing improvements in accuracy, F1-score, and G-means compared to existing methods.  The ablation study regarding optimal MIS for different metrics is also insightful.
* **Clear and Well-Written:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the proposed method and experimental setup.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited Scope of Experiments:**  While the experiments cover image and text classification, exploring other domains (e.g., object detection) would further strengthen the paper.
* **Comparison with Hyperparameter Tuning:**  A more thorough comparison with extensively tuned re-weighting methods would be beneficial.  While the paper mentions the time-consuming nature of such tuning, demonstrating a more direct comparison would further highlight the advantage of the proposed BA method.
* **Theoretical Analysis of BA:**  While the empirical results are strong, providing a more theoretical justification for the effectiveness of BA would enhance the paper.
* **Sensitivity Analysis:**  Analyzing the sensitivity of the proposed method to the choice of validation set and the search strategy for optimal r* would be helpful.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of imbalanced learning. The proposed method is novel, efficient, and shows promising results. Addressing the mentioned weaknesses would further solidify the paper's contribution and increase its impact.  The paper is worthy of acceptance, as it opens up a new direction in imbalanced learning research.
