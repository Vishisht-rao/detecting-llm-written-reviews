This paper introduces NPEFF (Non-Negative Per-Example Fisher Factorization), a novel interpretability method for deep learning models. The core idea is to decompose per-example Fisher information matrices into non-negative components, which represent sub-computations or heuristics learned by the model.  The paper is well-written and presents a compelling approach, but there are some areas that could be strengthened.

**Strengths:**

* **Novelty:** NPEFF offers a fresh perspective on interpretability by focusing on the Fisher information and its decomposition, which is a departure from common activation-based methods. The non-negative factorization of low-rank Fisher matrices, in particular, seems to be a novel contribution.
* **General Applicability:**  The method is applicable to any differentiable model architecture, which is a significant advantage over methods tailored to specific architectures.
* **Theoretical Grounding:**  The connection between the Fisher information and KL-divergence provides a solid theoretical basis for the interpretation of the components and the guided perturbation experiments.
* **Empirical Validation:**  The experiments on NLP and vision tasks demonstrate the potential of NPEFF to uncover meaningful and interpretable components. The TRACR-compiled model experiment provides a valuable controlled setting to validate the method.
* **Potential for Model Improvement:**  The guided perturbation experiments suggest that NPEFF could be used to identify and potentially correct flawed heuristics, opening up exciting possibilities for model debugging and improvement.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Scalability:** While the authors address sparsity, the computational cost of calculating and decomposing Fisher matrices for large datasets and complex models could still be a limiting factor.  More discussion on the scalability of the proposed multi-GPU algorithm would be beneficial.
* **Handling High-Dimensional Output Spaces:** The paper acknowledges limitations with models having large output spaces (e.g., autoregressive models). This is a significant limitation that needs to be addressed in future work for broader applicability.
* **D-NPEFF vs. LRM-NPEFF:** The paper presents two versions of NPEFF. While the differences are discussed, a clearer justification for choosing one over the other in different scenarios would be helpful. The inconsistent performance of the two versions across different tasks raises questions about their relative strengths and weaknesses.
* **Comparison with other methods:** While the paper includes a comparison with a k-means baseline, comparing NPEFF to a broader range of interpretability methods (e.g., those based on attention or attribution) would strengthen the paper.
* **Limited Application of Fixing Flawed Heuristics:**  The application of NPEFF to fixing flawed heuristics is presented as a "proof of concept."  While promising, more extensive experiments and a more developed methodology are needed to demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of this approach.


**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* Provide more details on the computational complexity and runtime of NPEFF, especially for the low-rank version.
* Explore alternative approaches for handling high-dimensional output spaces.
* Conduct a more thorough comparison of D-NPEFF and LRM-NPEFF, potentially including a more detailed analysis of their performance characteristics.
* Expand the comparison with other interpretability methods.
* Develop a more robust methodology for fixing flawed heuristics, potentially incorporating loss gradient information.

Overall, NPEFF is a promising new method for interpretability with a strong theoretical foundation and interesting empirical results.  Addressing the weaknesses mentioned above would significantly strengthen the paper and enhance its impact.
