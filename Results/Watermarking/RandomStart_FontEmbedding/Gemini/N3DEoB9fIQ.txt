OUTPUT:
This paper proposes DML-TS-NNR, a novel Thompson Sampling algorithm for mHealth interventions that incorporates Double Machine Learning (DML) and Nearest Neighbor Regularization (NNR).  This addresses several key challenges in applying contextual bandits to mHealth: time-varying outcomes, non-linear relationships, changing intervention efficacy, and similar participant responses.

**Strengths:**

* **Novelty:** The combination of DML for baseline reward modeling and NNR for pooling information across users and time is a significant contribution. This allows for flexible handling of non-linear reward functions and leverages similarities between users and across time, which is crucial in mHealth.
* **Theoretical Guarantees:** The paper provides a pseudo-regret bound that highlights the benefits of the proposed approach, specifically the dependence on the differential reward complexity rather than the overall model complexity, and the impact of DML on reducing regret.
* **Empirical Validation:**  The simulation studies and the application to the Valentine and Intern Health studies provide compelling evidence for the superior performance of DML-TS-NNR compared to existing methods.  The results demonstrate robustness to different baseline reward models and varying degrees of user heterogeneity.
* **Clarity and Organization:** The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The motivation, model description, algorithm, theoretical results, and experiments are presented clearly.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Computational Complexity:** The authors acknowledge the computational cost of matrix inversion and log-determinant calculations, which could be a limitation for large-scale applications.  Further investigation and potential mitigation strategies would strengthen the paper.
* **Assumptions:**  Several assumptions are made (e.g., linear differential reward, known network structure, bounded weights). While justifiable in the context of the paper, exploring the relaxation of these assumptions would be valuable future work.  Specifically, exploring more complex network structures and learning them from data would be interesting.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The algorithm has several hyperparameters.  While not explicitly discussed, the impact of hyperparameter tuning on performance should be addressed.  Providing guidance on hyperparameter selection in practice would be beneficial.
* **Limited Discussion on Fatigue:** While acknowledged, the issue of treatment fatigue deserves more attention.  How could the algorithm be modified to incorporate and address fatigue?  This is crucial for long-term mHealth interventions.

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of contextual bandits for mHealth. The proposed DML-TS-NNR algorithm addresses important practical challenges and shows promising empirical results.  While some limitations exist, they are acknowledged by the authors and provide avenues for future research.  The paper is well-written and technically sound, making it a valuable contribution to the ICLR community.  I recommend acceptance with minor revisions addressing the weaknesses mentioned above.  Specifically, adding further discussion on computational complexity, the potential for relaxing assumptions, hyperparameter tuning, and addressing treatment fatigue would significantly strengthen the paper.
