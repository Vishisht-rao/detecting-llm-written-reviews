OUTPUT:
This paper introduces "Soon Filter," a modification to the Ultra Low-Energy Edge Neural Network (ULEEN) architecture, aimed at improving efficiency for high-throughput edge inference.  ULEEN uses binary-valued Bloom filters for neuron activation, offering advantages over Binary Neural Networks (BNNs). However, the authors identify a gradient backpropagation bottleneck within ULEEN's Bloom filter implementation, specifically in its continuous relaxation using the *min* function.  They propose the "Soon Filter" as a solution, replacing the *min* aggregation with a *sum* operation.  This simplification, while increasing false positives in the filter, allows for improved gradient flow.

**Strengths:**

* **Clearly Identified Problem:** The paper effectively pinpoints the gradient bottleneck stemming from the *min* function's derivative behavior in ULEEN's Bloom filter relaxation.  The theoretical analysis is sound and well-explained.
* **Simple yet Effective Solution:** The proposed "Soon Filter" is elegantly simple, requiring minimal modification to the ULEEN architecture and preserving its hardware advantages.
* **Strong Empirical Results:** The experimental evaluation across MLPerf Tiny, UCI datasets, and MNIST demonstrates consistent improvements over ULEEN, BNNs, and DeepShift, particularly in terms of accuracy for a given model size. The 2x model size reduction at iso-accuracy for KWS is especially compelling.
* **Ablation Study Validation:** The ablation studies varying the number of hash functions corroborate the theoretical analysis regarding filter equivalence and demonstrate the consistent superiority of the Soon Filter.
* **Hardware Considerations Addressed:**  The paper explicitly discusses the minimal hardware implications of the proposed change, reinforcing its practicality for edge deployments.


**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited Novelty:** While the proposed solution is effective, it represents an incremental improvement over ULEEN rather than a fundamentally new approach.  The core contribution lies in identifying and addressing a specific bottleneck within an existing architecture.
* **False Positive Implications Not Fully Explored:** While acknowledging the increased false positive rate of the Soon Filter, the paper doesn't delve into the potential impact of this on specific applications.  A more detailed analysis of this trade-off would strengthen the paper.
* **Hardware Evaluation Missing:** The paper relies on previous ULEEN hardware results and projects potential efficiency gains. Actual hardware implementation and benchmarking are crucial for validating these projections and would significantly enhance the paper's impact.
* **Comparison with other WNN architectures:** While comparison to BNNs and DeepShift is reasonable, since they are well established binary and multiplication-free architectures, comparison to other WNN approaches is missing and can further show the effectiveness of this approach.


**Overall:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of efficient edge inference. The Soon Filter's simplicity, effectiveness, and minimal hardware impact make it a promising approach for resource-constrained devices. Addressing the weaknesses mentioned above, particularly through hardware evaluation and a more thorough exploration of the false positive implications, would further solidify the paper's contribution.  Despite the incremental nature of the improvement, the demonstrated performance gains and practical considerations warrant acceptance at ICLR.
