## Review of "Robust Self-Supervised Learning in Heterogeneous Graph Based on Feature-Topology Balancing"

This paper proposes BFTNet, a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for heterogeneous information networks (HINs). The core idea is to decouple the learning of node features and graph topology, addressing the common issue in real-world HINs where one of these aspects may be noisy or unreliable. This decoupling allows BFTNet to adapt to datasets with varying feature-topology information quality by balancing their relative importance.

**Strengths:**

* **Novel Approach:** The decoupled learning of topology and features using separate modules (knowledge graph embedding and contrastive learning, respectively) is a novel and promising approach. This allows for flexible adaptation to datasets with skewed information content, which is a common problem in real-world scenarios.
* **Robustness:** The experiments demonstrate BFTNet's robustness to noise, both in node features and graph structure. This is a significant advantage over existing methods that often rely on the reliability of both aspects.
* **Strong Empirical Results:** BFTNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets for both node classification and clustering tasks. The significant improvements on IMDB, a dataset with noisy features, highlight the practical value of the proposed approach.
* **Well-Motivated:** The paper clearly motivates the problem and provides a convincing argument for the need for a more robust SSL framework for HINs. The limitations of existing message-passing based methods are well explained.
* **Novel Graph Conversion:** The introduction of a transition node-wise metapath based graph conversion scheme appears beneficial in focusing on target nodes and improving topology learning.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Clarity and Presentation:** While the overall idea is clear, some parts of the paper could benefit from improved clarity. Specifically, the explanation of the graph conversion process and the rationale behind the specific choices could be more detailed.  Visualizations could further aid in understanding the process.
* **Complexity:** The architecture of BFTNet, with its multiple modules and loss functions, is relatively complex. A discussion of the computational complexity and scalability of the model would be helpful.
* **Ablation Study:** While the ablation study provides some insights into the contribution of different components, it could be more comprehensive.  For example, analyzing the impact of the hyperparameters α and β in more detail, beyond just reporting the optimal values, would be beneficial. Exploring alternative architectures for the individual modules (knowledge graph embedding and contrastive learning) could further strengthen the analysis.
* **Limited Novelty of Individual Modules:**  While the combination and balancing of the modules is novel, the individual modules themselves (knowledge graph embedding and contrastive learning) are based on existing techniques.  Highlighting specific adaptations or improvements made to these modules within BFTNet would strengthen the paper.


**Overall:**

This paper presents a novel and promising approach to SSL in HINs. The decoupled learning of features and topology, combined with the novel graph conversion scheme, leads to a more robust and effective framework. The strong empirical results support the effectiveness of the proposed approach.  Addressing the minor weaknesses mentioned above, particularly improving clarity and expanding the ablation study, would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact.  I recommend accepting this paper with minor revisions.
