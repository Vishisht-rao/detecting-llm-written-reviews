OUTPUT:
This paper proposes a novel training algorithm, Excitation-Inhibition Mechanism assisted Hybrid Learning (EIHL), for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs).  The core idea is to dynamically balance local (STDP) and global (STBP) learning based on the network's connectivity, mimicking the biological excitation-inhibition mechanism.  When the network is deemed "over-excited" (low sparsity), local learning with a contraction mechanism increases sparsity. Conversely, when "over-inhibited" (high sparsity exceeding a threshold), global learning takes over.

The strengths of the paper include:

* **Biologically Inspired:** The use of the excitation-inhibition mechanism offers a novel and biologically plausible approach to combining local and global learning in SNNs.
* **Improved Performance:**  EIHL demonstrates improved accuracy compared to STDP and STBP alone, and even against other hybrid learning methods like HP and EICIL on CIFAR and DVS-CIFAR datasets.
* **Sparsity Advantage:**  EIHL yields sparse networks, crucial for energy efficiency in SNN hardware implementations, which is a clear advantage over HP and EICIL.
* **Ablation Study:** The impact of the contraction parameter is explored, providing insights into the algorithm's behavior.
* **Robustness Evaluation:**  Experiments with random pruning demonstrate the robustness of EIHL.

However, some weaknesses should be addressed:

* **Clarity of Over-Excitation Criterion:** The criterion for switching from global to local learning ("Curr_S > Pre_S") needs more precise definition.  It relies on sparsity plateauing during global learning, which may not be a reliable indicator. A more quantifiable and theoretically grounded criterion would strengthen the work.
* **Threshold Parameter `b`:**  The target sparsity `b` is a crucial parameter that requires careful tuning. While the paper explores its impact, a deeper discussion of how to choose `b` for different datasets and network architectures is needed. A potential adaptive mechanism for adjusting `b` could be explored.
* **Limited Scalability Evaluation:**  Experiments are performed on relatively small datasets and network architectures. Evaluating EIHL on larger-scale datasets and more complex SNN architectures would be beneficial.
* **Comparison with other hybrid SNN training algorithms:** The paper only compared EIHL with HP and EICIL, there are more recently published hybrid training algorithms that should be compared.
* **Theoretical Analysis:** A more rigorous theoretical analysis of the convergence properties and the interplay between local and global learning in EIHL would strengthen the paper's contributions.

Overall, EIHL presents a promising approach to SNN training.  Addressing the above weaknesses, particularly clarifying the over-excitation criterion and providing guidance on parameter selection, would significantly enhance the paper's impact and facilitate wider adoption of the algorithm.  Further exploration of scalability and theoretical analysis would further solidify its contribution to the field.
