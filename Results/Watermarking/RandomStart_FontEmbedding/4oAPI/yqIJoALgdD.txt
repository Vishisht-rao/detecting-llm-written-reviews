Title: **Towards Zero Memory Footprint Spiking Neural Network Training**

The paper introduces an innovative approach to spiking neural network (SNN) training aimed at reducing memory usage during the training process. The authors present a reversible spiking neuron design, which allows for the retrieval of intermediate states on-the-fly, resulting in a significant reduction in memory footprint.

### Strengths:

1. **Innovative Approach**: The idea of a reversible spiking neuron is novel and could have substantial implications for training SNNs, especially in memory-constrained environments like IoT-edge devices.

2. **Significant Memory Reduction**: The reported 58.65× reduction in memory usage compared to current spiking neurons, and the scalability in memory complexity to O(1), are impressive. This could enable more complex and deeper SNNs on devices with limited resources.

3. **Improved Training Time**: The proposed algorithm not only addresses memory issues but also aims to streamline the backpropagation process, achieving a 23.8% reduction in training time. This dual focus on both memory and computational efficiency is commendable.

4. **Empirical Validation**: The empirical results highlight substantial memory savings across various datasets and architectures. The experiments show that the approach retains accuracy while significantly reducing memory needs, further validating the practical utility of the approach.

5. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The authors test their method across multiple architectures (VGG and ResNet) and datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, DVS-CIFAR10, and DVS128-Gesture), providing a robust evaluation of their approach.

6. **Theoretical and Empirical Alignment**: The paper does a good job aligning theoretical expectations with empirical results, enhancing confidence in the proposed method's effectiveness.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Complexity of Explanation**: The explanation of the reversible spiking neuron and the backpropagation process could be further simplified for accessibility. The mathematical equations and descriptions might be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the domain or mathematical formalism in neuroscience.

2. **Limited Discussion on Trade-offs**: While memory and computational gains are discussed, potential trade-offs, such as increased algorithmic complexity or potential latency in on-the-fly calculations, are not thoroughly addressed. A deeper analysis of these trade-offs would be beneficial.

3. **Scalability Limitations**: Although the paper presents improvements in memory efficiency, it would be valuable to discuss any potential limitations regarding the scalability of these methods when moving to even larger-scale networks or more complex real-world applications.

4. **Ablation Study**: While an ablation study is presented, more detailed insights into how different parameters specifically affect performance and whether there are optimal settings across various contexts could provide clearer guidelines for implementation.

5. **Impact on Broader SNN Applications**: While the paper demonstrates improvements in specific benchmarks, it could further elaborate on how these advancements impact broader applications of SNNs, beyond classification tasks.

### Conclusion:

This paper presents a promising advancement in the field of Spiking Neural Networks by addressing critical issues of memory efficiency. The development of a reversible spiking neuron design could significantly impact the deployment of SNNs in memory-constrained environments. While the method shows substantial improvements, further simplification of explanations and a detailed exploration of trade-offs could enhance the paper's accessibility and applicability. Overall, the proposed method is likely to be of great interest to researchers working on neuromorphic computing and energy-efficient neural networks.This paper addresses the key issue of high memory consumption in the training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which is a significant bottleneck that limits their scalability and deployment, especially in resource-constrained environments. The authors propose a novel framework aimed at minimizing memory usage during the training process by introducing a reversible spiking neuron model and an efficient backpropagation algorithm.

### Strengths:

1. **Novelty and Impact:** The introduction of a reversible spiking neuron model is an innovative step towards reducing memory footprint to O(1). This is a substantial improvement over traditional SNN training methods, which scale with the number of layers and timesteps, leading to higher memory requirements.

2. **Memory Efficiency:** The proposed solution achieves significant reductions in memory usage during training. The reported improvements, such as a 58.65× reduction in memory for large SNN architectures, are impressive and suggest that this method could facilitate the deployment of SNNs in edge devices where memory is limited.

3. **Training Efficiency:** By redesigning the backpropagation process to avoid reconstructing the forward computation graph, the paper claims a 23.8% reduction in training time. This is a noteworthy contribution, as it addresses both memory and computational efficiency.

4. **Experimental Validation:** The paper provides extensive experimental results across multiple datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, DVS-CIFAR10, and DVS128-Gesture) and architectures (VGG and ResNet). The results consistently demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of both memory savings and training speed, while maintaining comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art methods.

5. **Comprehensive Analysis:** The authors present a thorough evaluation of various hyperparameters and design choices, such as the number of groups in the reversible neuron architecture, enhancing the depth of the study and the understanding of the method’s robustness.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Clarity on Implementation Details:** While the high-level description of the reversible neuron model and backpropagation algorithm is provided, some readers may benefit from a more detailed explanation of the mathematical derivations and algorithmic steps, particularly those less familiar with reversible computing and its application in SNNs.

2. **Generalization Across Tasks:** Although the paper demonstrates success on several datasets, the applicability and performance of the proposed method for other types of tasks or data, such as reinforcement learning or more complex temporal sensing datasets, is not explored.

3. **Quantitative Limitations:** While the memory and computational gains are substantial, there is limited discussion on the trade-offs, if any, in terms of the computational overhead introduced by the reversible operations and their impact on inference performance.

4. **Comparison with Novel Methods:** The paper compares its method against existing techniques, but it would benefit from a discussion on how it rivals newer approaches or emerging trends not captured in the current state-of-the-art.

### Conclusion:

Overall, this paper makes a substantial contribution to the field of SNNs by addressing core issues related to memory and computational efficiency. The work is well-structured, methodically validated, and has the potential to drive further research in making SNNs more accessible for real-world applications where hardware resources are limited. Future work could extend the framework's application scope, test its efficacy in diverse environments, and explore the potential for integrated hardware implementations.
