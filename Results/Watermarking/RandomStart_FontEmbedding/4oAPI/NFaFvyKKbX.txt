OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the key issue of quantifying the non-linearity of deep neural networks (DNNs) and individual activation functions, which is an area that has not been extensively studied despite the crucial role non-linearity plays in the expressive power of DNNs. The authors propose an innovative solution by introducing the affinity score, a theoretically grounded tool based on optimal transport theory, to track non-linearity propagation in neural networks, particularly in computer vision applications.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty:** The paper presents a novel approach to measuring non-linearity in DNNs through the proposed affinity score. This metric offers a unique perspective on understanding the complex dynamics within DNNs.

2. **Theoretical Foundation:** The methodology is grounded in optimal transport theory, providing a robust mathematical framework. This is beneficial as it lends credibility and a solid theoretical basis to the proposed metric.

3. **Comprehensive Analysis:** The authors conduct extensive experiments on a wide range of neural network architectures, from Alexnet to vision transformers. The experimental setup is thorough and captures a diverse array of models, showing the potential for broad applicability of the affinity score.

4. **Insightful Findings:** The paper provides interesting insights into how non-linearity propagates across layers in different architectures. For example, it shows that earlier networks like Alexnet exhibit stable non-linearity across layers, whereas more complex models demonstrate varying degrees of non-linearity, which correspond with network design innovations such as inception modules and skip connections.

5. **Relevance to Practitioners:** The study is not only theoretical but has practical implications. Understanding non-linearity propagation can influence architectural choices and optimization strategies for neural networks, making this research relevant to practitioners aiming to enhance model performance.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity and Accessibility:** The use of optimal transport theory, while robust, may introduce complexity that could make the methodology less accessible to a wider audience, particularly those not well-versed in advanced mathematical concepts.

2. **Empirical Nature:** Despite its theoretical underpinnings, the paper predominantly explores empirical results. While this is valuable, a more in-depth theoretical exploration of how the affinity score correlates with generalization and performance might add depth to the analysis.

3. **Comparative Evaluation:** Although the authors mention alternative metrics like CKA and sparsity, a deeper comparative study showing how the affinity score outperforms or complements these existing metrics in practical scenarios would strengthen the paper.

4. **Potential Over-interpretation:** While the paper highlights strong correlations between non-linearity measured by the affinity score and model performance, these observations should be interpreted cautiously. Correlation does not imply causation, and further studies are necessary to establish causal relationships more concretely.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

- **User-Friendly Explanations:** Simplifying explanations of the optimal transport theory and its application could make the paper more accessible to a broader audience.

- **Extended Comparisons:** Including more detailed comparisons with other non-linearity and expressiveness measures could provide a clearer context for the contributions of the affinity score.

- **Application Scenarios:** Exploring specific case studies where changes in the affinity score lead to meaningful improvements in model design or training could provide actionable insights for practitioners.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, this paper makes a substantial contribution to understanding the non-linearity in deep neural networks. The proposed affinity score represents a promising tool for researchers and practitioners seeking to gain insights into neural network dynamics. While the paper is theoretically comprehensive and empirically rich, it would benefit from a clarified explanation of complex concepts and more rigorous comparative studies.
