OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the key issue of assessing the uncertainty inherent in the estimation of ROC curves, particularly in the context of similarity scoring functions such as those used in face recognition (FR) systems. The authors argue that accurately evaluating the uncertainty of empirical ROC curves is crucial for applications where the societal impact is significant, ensuring that fairness and performance metrics are trustworthily assessed. 

To this end, the paper makes several contributions. First, it establishes the strong consistency of empirical similarity ROC curves, which is necessary for giving confidence in such empirical evaluations. Second, it identifies a specific problem with applying naive bootstrap methods in this context due to dependency structures, which may lead to an underestimation of ROC curves. In response, the authors propose a recentered bootstrap methodology. This approach aligns appropriately with U-statistics properties and provides confidence bands for ROC curves and fairness metrics with assured asymptotic validity.

Their experimental results, conducted using real face image datasets, demonstrate the practical significance of the proposed methods. For instance, they show how uncertainty quantification can prevent misleading conclusions about model performance by incorporating confidence intervals that might indicate overlapping performance due to variability inherent in the empirical curves.

Additionally, the paper contributes to fairness evaluation by providing tools to assess fairness metrics' robustness via an uncertainty measure. The experiments indicate that among tested fairness metrics, the max-geomean metric displays the lowest uncertainty, suggesting its utility in fairness assessments.

Strengths:
1. **Addressing Uncertainty in ROC Curves:** The paper tackles an important problem in the practical application of face recognition by addressing the uncertainty in ROC curves, which is critical for performance and fairness evaluation.
2. **Methodological Innovation:** By proposing a recentered bootstrap methodology, the authors introduce a solution catering to the unique statistical challenges of similarity scoring problems, which could be influential for future studies involving U-statistics in similar contexts.
3. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The empirical experiments are based on robust datasets and models, providing convincing evidence of the benefits of the proposed methodology.

Weaknesses:
1. **Complexity:** The paper is dense with technical detail, especially on the statistical properties and proofs, which may pose a challenge for readers not specialized in statistical learning theory.
2. **Limited Practical Guidance:** While the paper provides robust theoretical contributions, it could offer more practical guidance or simpler summaries for practitioners looking to implement these methods in real-world systems.

Overall, this work is a valuable contribution to the field of machine learning applied to face recognition. It provides significant advancements in both theoretical and empirical assessments of fairness and performance metrics, contributing to the development of more reliable and fair AI systems. The paper would interest researchers and practitioners developing or evaluating face recognition technologies, particularly those focused on ensuring fairness and transparency.
