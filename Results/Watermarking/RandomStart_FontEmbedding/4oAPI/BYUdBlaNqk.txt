OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the key issue of understanding how video understanding models, compared to image-based models, relate to the biological neural systems, specifically focusing on the visual cortex. The authors propose a large-scale study assessing the system identification capabilities of different neural network architectures—sing image versus video, convolutional versus transformer-based, and fully versus self-supervised models—by using fMRI responses as a benchmark.

**Strengths:**

1. **Comprehensiveness:** The paper provides a large-scale analysis involving more than 30 models, which is significant in terms of scope. The diverse set of models offers a broader understanding of the dynamics of neural network architectures compared to previously isolated studies.

2. **Novelty:** Addressing the temporal aspect of video inputs and comparing single image processing to video dynamics in modeling neural responses is an important and relatively under-explored area in the context of deep learning and neuroscience integration.

3. **Methodological Insights:** The paper improves upon previous encoding models by accounting for the hierarchical nature of network layers and their complex interactions. This enhances the study’s ability to predict brain activity from deep learning models.

4. **Results and Contributions:** The findings demonstrate that video models better predict visual cortex responses than image models. The paper also provides insights into the performance benefits of two-stream models, multiscale transformers, and the impact of model supervision on predicting neural responses.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Clarity on Methodology:** While the methodological approach is comprehensive, the paper could benefit from more detailed explanations of the processes involved in regression analysis and encoding, particularly for audiences less familiar with the technical nuances of neural encoding.

2. **Statistical Analysis:** Although the paper mentions statistical significance testing results, providing more detailed information on the statistical methods and ensuring robustness in statistical claims would strengthen the paper’s validity.

3. **Data Constraints:** The study’s reliance on the Mini-Algonauts 2021 dataset, limited to only a training set without a test set, may raise concerns about overfitting or sample-specific insights that might not generalize across broader datasets or conditions.

4. **Detailed Discussion:** While the paper presents key insights, a more in-depth discussion of the implications of these findings for neuroscience and the development of future neural network models could enhance the paper. Further exploration of how the identified dynamics might influence model architectures would add value.

5. **Focus on Temporal Dynamics:** While video models are shown to have a superior capacity for capturing brain dynamics, the paper could provide a stronger interpretation of how specific temporal dynamics (e.g., motion, continuity) relate to functional brain processes.

**Conclusion:**

This paper makes a significant contribution to the understanding of how video-based models relate to and potentially reflect biological neural computations within the human visual cortex. By evaluating a wide array of models and examining the distinction between different architectures and training strategies, the study paves the way for deeper insights into both AI model development and brain function analysis. However, enhancing clarity in methodology, robustness of statistical testing, and a deeper exploration of implications would greatly benefit the overall strength and impact of the work.
