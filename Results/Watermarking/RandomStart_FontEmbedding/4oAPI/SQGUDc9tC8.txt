OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the key issue of social biases in pre-trained language models (PLMs), which can have negative impacts on societal fairness and equity. The authors propose a novel interpretability method, INTEGRATED GAPGRADIENTS (IG2), to identify specific neurons (called SOCIAL BIAS NEURONS) responsible for biased behavior in PLMs. Additionally, they introduce a debiasing technique called BIASNEURON SUPPRESSION (BNS) to mitigate these biases by suppressing the activation of these identified neurons.

The paper is well-motivated, addressing a significant issue in the development and deployment of PLMs. The authors provide a thorough review of existing methods for bias detection and mitigation, highlighting the limitations of approaches that treat models as black boxes and rely on high-cost dataset construction. This sets the stage for their contribution in providing a more interpretable and cost-effective solution.

The methodology section is detailed, explaining the IG2 technique and its foundation in the Integrated Gradients method. The authors make a compelling case for why traditional methods fall short when addressing social biases, which are rooted in distributional properties rather than singular instances. Their approach to attributing the logits gap for model predictions across demographic groups is innovative and well-explained.

The experiments are robust, with validation performed on well-known PLMs like BERT and RoBERTa, as well as a debiased variant, FairBERTa. The development of a new dataset tailored for bias interpretability enhances the credibility and scope of the experimental results. However, the paper would benefit from a comparison with additional datasets or real-world applications to further demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.

The results show that IG2 can effectively pinpoint bias-relevant neurons, and the BNS technique significantly reduces bias while preserving language modeling abilities, as measured by standard metrics like StereoSet's ICAT. The authors also offer an insightful analysis into the distribution shifts of social bias neurons after debiasing, providing valuable insights for future research.

Despite its strengths, the paper has some limitations. BNS directly sets the identified neurons to zero, which, while effective, might be a simplistic approach. Future work could explore more nuanced methods for neuron suppression or consider the broader implications of neuron modification on model behavior. Furthermore, the reliance on a manually designed dataset and templates might limit the generalizability of the results across different contexts and languages.

In conclusion, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field by providing a novel mechanism to trace and mitigate biases in language models. The methodological innovations and experimental validations offer valuable insights, though future research is necessary to refine the techniques and broaden their applicability.
