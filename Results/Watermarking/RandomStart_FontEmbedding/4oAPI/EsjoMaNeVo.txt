OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the key issue of how to guide no-regret-learning agents towards optimal equilibria in games through nonnegative payments. This is an important problem in the field of game theory and mechanism design because real-world scenarios often involve players who are learning from past interactions while potentially skewing towards suboptimal equilibria. By steering these players toward preferable outcomes, we can enhance overall social welfare in strategic settings.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Contribution**: The paper makes a substantial theoretical contribution by showing that while it is impossible to steer players using a finite budget of payments, it is feasible with vanishing average payments. This is an important finding as it bridges the gap between total budget constraints and achievable strategic outcomes in learning environments.

2. **Comprehensive Approach**: The authors explore the problem in-depth, addressing both normal-form and extensive-form games, and consider scenarios both where full strategies and only game trajectories are observable, lending robustness to their theoretical framework.

3. **Theoretical Rigor and Experimental Validation**: The paper not only establishes theoretical results and impossibility results with clear proofs but also backs these findings with experiments demonstrating the efficacy of the steering methods. This combination strengthens the validity of the theoretical claims.

4. **Connection to Other Research Areas**: By relating their framework to fields like optimal mechanism design and information design, the authors place their work in a broader context, potentially allowing it to be expanded or applied to various domains, such as economics, AI, and self-learning systems.

5. **Well-Structured Presentation**: The paper is well-organized with clear sections detailing the introduction, preliminaries, main results, and algorithmic approaches. The use of visual aids such as figures and algorithms notation adds to the clarity of the presentation.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Practical Implementability**: While the theoretical results are impressive, there is a concern about the practical applicability of these results. The paper mostly remains within the theoretical realm, and it would have been beneficial to see more discussion on real-world deployment or the practical considerations of these algorithms.

2. **Complexity and Assumptions**: Some of the assumptions, like the knowledge of regret bounds or the computational feasibility of certain steps (e.g., equilibrium computation), could limit the real-world applicability. More discussion or even relaxation of these assumptions would make the results more widely applicable.

3. **Limited Consideration of Alternative Learning Strategies**: The paper primarily assumes a no-regret learning paradigm without exploring if and how the results would differ under alternative assumptions about the learning dynamics of the agents beyond those mentioned in future research directions.

4. **Discussion on Negative Experimental Results**: The experiments focus on highlighting positives. It would be beneficial to report at least some negative or unexpected results to provide insights into potential limitations or conditions where steering may not work as expected.

5. **Complexity of Algorithms**: There's less emphasis on the complexity of algorithms from a computational standpoint, which could make it difficult to understand the scalability issues associated with increasing game size or number of players.

**Overall Recommendation:**
The paper makes strong theoretical contributions to the field of learning in games, specifically in steering no-regret learners towards optimal equilibria. While the results are promising, the paper would benefit from further exploration into application scenarios, discussion on assumptions, and scalability of the proposed algorithms. The paper is suited for those with a deep interest in game theory, learning dynamics, and mechanism design, standing as a notable addition to conference discussions. I recommend its acceptance for publication, with suggestions for further empirical validation and exploration of practical applications as next steps in the research agenda.
