OUTPUT:
Okay, here's a review of the provided ICLR 2024 submission draft.

**The article focuses on the key area of video action anticipation, presenting a novel "Actions-to-Action" model that leverages inductive attention for improved performance in egocentric video analysis. The paper is well-written and addresses an important problem in computer vision. While the core idea is interesting, the presentation and experimental results need some refinement before publication.**

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The core idea of incorporating prior anticipation results as priors for future predictions, drawing inspiration from object tracking, is novel and potentially effective. The "inductive attention" mechanism is a reasonable approach to implementing this.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The problem statement is clear, and the motivation for the proposed approach is well-articulated. The description of the model architecture (higher-order recurrent structure and inductive attention) is also reasonably clear, though it could benefit from some more detailed explanations (see comments below).
*   **Empirical Evaluation:** The paper presents experimental results on three benchmark datasets (EPIC-Kitchens-100, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and EGTEA Gaze+), which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model. The comparison with existing methods is comprehensive, and the ablation studies provide insights into the contribution of each component.
*   **Real-world Relevance:** The paper clearly motivates the real-world applications of video action anticipation, such as assistive navigation, collaborative robotics, interactive entertainment, and autonomous vehicles.
*   **Good balance:** The authors show a good balance in model size and computational efficiency.

**Weaknesses & Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Clarity and Details on Inductive Attention:** While the core concept is understandable, the details of the inductive attention mechanism (specifically, the compression functions Ex, Eq, Ek) could be explained more thoroughly.
    *   What are the specific architectures used for these compression functions? Are they simple linear layers, MLPs, or more complex networks?
    *   What is the dimensionality of the embedded space?
    *   The paper should include a diagram that visually represents the inductive attention mechanism, as it would greatly improve understanding.
*   **Algorithm 1 Clarity:** Algorithm 1 could be improved. The notation `\yt−S:t−1` is confusing (mixed math notation and code). It's also unclear how `M_t` is a queue, and the push and pop operations are not explicitly defined. The EK function is also not defined. A more detailed and precise pseudo-code would be beneficial.
*   **Justification for Design Choices:** The paper would be stronger if it provided more justification for certain design choices. For example:
    *   Why was the specific gating function `gt` chosen? Are there alternative gating mechanisms that were considered?
    *   The choice of `S` (the context length) seems to be important. Why is 30 seconds optimal? Is there a saturation effect? A more in-depth analysis of the impact of `S` would be valuable.
    *   Why use a first-in-first-out queue for the higher-order structure?
*   **Comparison to Transformers:** The paper claims to challenge the assumptions prevalent in current transformer models. However, this point is not fully developed.
    *   The paper should more clearly explain why the inherent assumption within the attention mechanism does not consistently align with video action anticipation.
    *   The paper should provide a more direct comparison (experimentally) to state-of-the-art transformer-based action anticipation models.
*   **Qualitative Analysis:** While Figure 3 shows some qualitative results, a more in-depth qualitative analysis would be beneficial.
    *   Provide more examples of successful and unsuccessful predictions.
    *   Elaborate on the reasons for the model's success or failure in specific scenarios.
    *   Consider visualizing the attention weights to understand which parts of the historical data are most important for prediction.
*   **Minor Points:**
    *   Abstract: "ACTIONS -TO-ACTION" is not very descriptive. Consider a more informative title.
    *   Introduction: "endowing machines with this innate ability remains a tough challenge" - "innate" is perhaps not the right word. "Acquired" or "learned" might be more appropriate.
    *   Related Work: The related work section is a bit too brief. It could benefit from more discussion of the limitations of existing methods.
    *   The writing is generally good, but there are a few grammatical errors and typos. Proofread carefully.

**Overall Recommendation:**

I recommend **reject with the option to resubmit** after addressing the above-mentioned weaknesses. The paper has a promising concept and shows potential, but the clarity, justification, and analysis need to be significantly improved before publication. The authors should focus on providing more details about the inductive attention mechanism, justifying their design choices, and providing a more in-depth comparison with existing methods.
