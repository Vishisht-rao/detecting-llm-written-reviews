**Review**

This paper studies an important problem: the inherent lack of interpretability in Graph Attention Networks (GATs) due to their dense attention mechanisms. The authors propose MapSelect, a novel, differentiable sparse attention mechanism for GATs that allows for user-defined control over the level of sparsity.  They present two variants: MapSelect-L (local, fixed degree per node) and MapSelect-G (global, preserving a percentage of the full graph).  The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of five sparse GATs (including their proposed method) across multiple datasets, analyzing the trade-offs between sparsity, accuracy, and interpretability.  The experimental results suggest that MapSelect offers competitive performance and improved interpretability, particularly in the local variant, when compared to baselines.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses a relevant problem:** Interpretability in GNNs is a crucial area of research, and the paper tackles a significant challenge with GATs.
*   **Novelty:** The proposed MapSelect method, using SparseMAP for controllable sparse attention in GATs, appears to be a novel contribution.  The two variants (local and global) provide flexibility and cater to different graph characteristics and task requirements.
*   **Thorough evaluation:** The paper presents a reasonably comprehensive evaluation, comparing MapSelect against a variety of baselines (Top-K, Entmax, NeuralSparse, SGAT, DropEdge) across several real-world datasets and a synthetic dataset with ground truth explanations. The investigation of sparsity-accuracy and sparsity-interpretability trade-offs provides valuable insights.
*   **Clear presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the proposed method and experimental setup. The figures are helpful in visualizing the concepts and results.
*   **Strong connection to related work:** The paper situates its work within the existing literature on sparse GNNs and rationalizers in NLP, highlighting the differences and advantages of the proposed approach.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors state that their code will be available.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Ablation Studies:** While the paper is thorough in its comparisons, it could benefit from more detailed ablation studies. For example, what is the impact of the temperature parameter in the SparseMAP function? How does the performance of MapSelect change with different GAT architectures besides GATv2? Further exploration of these aspects would strengthen the paper's findings.
*   **Interpretability metric:** While fidelity is a reasonable metric, the paper could benefit from exploring other interpretability metrics beyond fidelity and entropy. Other metrics that measure explanation plausibility or human-interpretability scores could add additional robustness to the claims.
*   **Clarity on hyperparameters:** While the Appendix details the hyperparameter search space, more context is needed on *why* these specific values were chosen and what specific values were used in each of the reported experiments. The experimental setup section also says that two GAT layers are used in *all* methods, which is a bit vague: how does the input dimensionality of the layers change depending on the addition of sparsity?
*   **Justification of design choices:** The paper mentions that applying an exponential operation before passing scores to SparseMAP in MapSelect-G improves stability but does not explain *why* this is the case. A more detailed justification of such design choices would strengthen the paper.
*   **Edge case of global approaches:** A key point is that global approaches outperform local ones, because local approaches don't allow the model to zero out all edges from one node if needed, whereas global approaches do. However, if the objective is node classification, it is rare to have cases where we don't need *any* edges for a particular node. Thus, is the performance gain due to this effect actually useful in a node classification setup?

**Questions for the Authors:**

*   Can you elaborate on the specific implementation details of the SparseMAP function and the active set method used for solving the optimization problem?
*   What are the computational costs associated with MapSelect compared to standard GATs, especially considering the additional SparseMAP step?
*   Have you considered applying MapSelect to other GNN architectures beyond GATs?
*   How sensitive is MapSelect to the choice of the sparsity budget (B)? Are there guidelines for selecting an appropriate value for B based on the characteristics of the graph?
*   What other interpretability metrics were considered?

**Overall Recommendation:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of interpretable GNNs.  The proposed MapSelect method is novel, well-motivated, and evaluated effectively.  While there are some areas for improvement, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses. I recommend **accepting with minor revisions**. The authors should address the above mentioned weaknesses and questions to strengthen the paper.
