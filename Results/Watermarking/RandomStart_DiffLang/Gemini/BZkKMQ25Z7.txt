**Review:**

This paper explores a critical problem in the field of brain activity decoding from fMRI data: the lack of universal and adaptable frameworks that can generalize across multiple subjects. The authors propose fMRI-PTE, a large-scale, pre-trained transformer encoder based on an auto-encoder architecture, designed to address variations in fMRI data dimensions stemming from individual brain differences. The paper presents a novel data transformation method, an efficient training strategy, and a novel learning strategy tailored for pre-training 2D fMRI images. The authors claim that fMRI-PTE facilitates various downstream tasks, including within-subject and cross-subject brain activity decoding, and they support their claims with extensive experiments.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses an Important Problem:** The paper tackles the crucial issue of inter-subject variability in fMRI data, a significant bottleneck in the development of generalizable brain decoding models. The motivation is clearly articulated, highlighting the limitations of existing subject-specific approaches.
*   **Novel Approach:** The proposed fMRI-PTE framework, with its data transformation to unified 2D representations, and the two-stage learning approach (quantized reconstruction and transformer compression), appears to be innovative and well-motivated. The authors draw clear inspiration from successful pre-trained models in other domains (BERT, MAE, GPT) and adapt these concepts to the specific challenges of fMRI data.
*   **Clear and Well-Structured:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, with a clear introduction of the problem, a detailed description of the proposed method, and a thorough presentation of experimental results. The figures are helpful in visualizing the pipeline and results. The contributions are clearly summarized.
*   **Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation:** The experimental section appears to be quite thorough, with comparisons against relevant baselines on both fMRI reconstruction and brain activity decoding tasks. The use of both low-level and high-level metrics for evaluating the quality of the decoded images is appreciated. The cross-subject evaluation is a key strength, directly addressing the paper's main goal.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors state they will make processed codes and datasets publicly available, which significantly enhances the reproducibility and impact of their work.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity on Specific Implementation Details:** While the paper describes the overall architecture and training strategy, some specific implementation details could be clarified. For example, further details regarding the exact composition of the residual blocks used in the first stage (VQGAN-inspired architecture) would be beneficial. The loss functions used in the "Quantized Reconstruction Stage" and their relative weights also warrant further elaboration. A complete appendix with hyperparameter settings would be valuable.
*   **Ablation Studies:** While the comparisons to existing methods are useful, more detailed ablation studies could strengthen the paper. For example, it would be insightful to investigate the impact of the two-stage learning approach by comparing fMRI-PTE to a single-stage autoencoder trained on the same data. The contribution of the mapper layer 'M' could be investigated with ablation studies.
*   **Limited Qualitative Analysis:** While the quantitative results are promising, the qualitative analysis could be enhanced with more diverse examples and critical discussion of failure cases. An analysis of the types of errors the model makes in reconstructing fMRI signals or decoding brain activity would provide valuable insights. It may also be valuable to add more example images reconstructed by different models, as well as more samples of generated images using the decoding approach for different subjects.
*   **Justification for hyperparameter choices:** The paper states the total training iteration is set to 600k. Some justification for this would be valuable. Similar justifications for the choice of batch sizes, depths, etc. would be helpful.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Provide More Implementation Details:** Expand the description of the implementation details, including network architectures, loss functions, and hyperparameters.
*   **Conduct More Detailed Ablation Studies:** Perform ablation studies to isolate the impact of different components of the fMRI-PTE framework, such as the two-stage learning approach and the mapper layer.
*   **Enhance Qualitative Analysis:** Include more diverse examples and discuss the limitations and failure cases of the proposed method.
*   **Address Runtime and Computational Cost:** Provide information on the training time and computational resources required for fMRI-PTE. This is crucial for assessing the practicality of the approach.
*   **Clarify Relationship to Brain-Diffuser:** Better emphasize the differences and nuances of the current paper vs Brain-Diffuser.

**Overall Assessment:**

The paper presents a novel and promising approach for addressing the challenge of inter-subject variability in fMRI data analysis. The proposed fMRI-PTE framework has the potential to significantly advance the field of brain activity decoding. While some aspects of the paper could be further strengthened with additional details and analysis, the overall contribution is significant. The paper is worthy of acceptance, contingent upon addressing the points raised above.
