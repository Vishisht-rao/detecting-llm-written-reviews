OUTPUT:
The manuscript investigates an important problem: understanding why neural networks arrive at particular computational strategies, rather than simply how they implement a target function. Focusing on algebraic tasks (modular addition, sparse parities, and finite group operations), the paper proposes that margin maximization alone can explain the emergence of specific features in trained networks. The authors analytically characterize the features learned by stylized neural networks, demonstrating that Fourier features are used for modular addition and irreducible group-theoretic representations are employed for group compositions. These theoretical findings are supported by empirical evidence showing that trained networks approach the maximum margin solution and exhibit the predicted weight structures.

**Strengths:**

*   **Important Problem:** The paper tackles a fundamental question in mechanistic interpretability: why certain representations arise during training. Moving beyond simply identifying "circuits," the work aims to explain their origin.
*   **Novel Approach:** The use of margin maximization, traditionally employed for generalization, to explain *representation learning* is a novel and potentially powerful approach.
*   **Clear Theoretical Results:** The informal theorem for modular addition provides a concrete, understandable prediction about the structure of the learned weights. The generalization to sparse parities and finite group operations strengthens the framework.
*   **Strong Empirical Validation:** The empirical results convincingly support the theoretical claims, showing that trained networks do indeed approach the maximum margin solution and learn the predicted feature structures. The visualizations (e.g., Figure 1, 2) are effective in illustrating the theoretical findings.
*   **Rigorous Approach:** The paper employs a sound theoretical framework, leveraging max-min duality and the properties of homogeneous networks to characterize maximum margin solutions. The use of class-weighted margins to extend the analysis to multi-class classification is well-executed.
*   **Blueprint and Lemma 4:** The "blueprint" in Section 3.1 provides a clear overview of the proof strategy. The Lemma 4 (and Lemma 9 for multi-class) are particularly powerful, as they allow characterizing *all* maximum margin solutions based on identifying a single "certificate pair."
*   **Connections to Existing Work:** The paper effectively connects its findings to existing work on grokking (Power et al., Nanda et al.) and mechanistic interpretability. It also contrasts its approach with other theoretical work on inductive bias.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Stylized Networks:** The theoretical results are derived for one-hidden layer MLPs with specific activation functions (quadratic or x^k) and norms (L2,ν). While the empirical results suggest the findings may generalize, the limitations of the theoretical framework should be emphasized.The extent to which the results hold for deep networks, different architectures (e.g., Transformers, as suggested by the related work), and more complex tasks is unclear.
*   **Width Requirements:** The width requirements (e.g., m ≥ 4(p-1) for modular addition) may be restrictive. It would be helpful to discuss whether these bounds are tight and whether similar results hold for smaller networks.
*   **Condition for Finite Groups:** The condition required for some groups for the Finite Group Theorem: that PK
n=2dR
n1.5χRn(C)<0for every non-trivial conjugacy class C is not satisfied for many finite groups. How general is this theorem? The authors could make this more clear in the main text, as at first read, it seems the theorem can hold for *any* finite group.
*   **Technical Depth:** The paper is quite technical, particularly the proofs in the appendix. While this is necessary for rigor, it may limit the accessibility of the work to a wider audience. A more intuitive explanation of the main ideas could be beneficial. A diagram illustrating the relationship between g, g', theta*, q* might be helpful.
*   **Lack of comparison to an alternative construction** An important point that is missing is an attempt at providing a baseline. It is important to show this result is novel.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Discuss Generalization:** Explicitly address the limitations of the theoretical framework and discuss the extent to which the results may generalize to more realistic neural networks and tasks.
*   **Address Width Requirements:** Comment on the tightness of the width bounds and whether similar results hold for smaller networks. Provide more intuition regarding why the bound is there.
*   **Elaborate Condition for Finite Groups:** Discuss possible groups for which the finite group condition applies.
*   **Improve Accessibility:** Add a more intuitive explanation of the main ideas, perhaps with a motivating example.
*   **Add diagram:** Illustrate g, g', theta*, q*.
*   **Add an alternative construction baseline:** Provide an example to show the novelty of the result.
*   **Clarify the nature of the group in the result for the modular addition problem.** The modular addition problem is an integer operation on the Cyclic group. Is the result really more general to any Cyclic group, or any Abelian group? It would be worth mentioning this.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the understanding of representation learning in neural networks. The novel approach, clear theoretical results, and strong empirical validation make it a valuable addition to the literature. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper and broaden its impact. The manuscript should be accepted.
