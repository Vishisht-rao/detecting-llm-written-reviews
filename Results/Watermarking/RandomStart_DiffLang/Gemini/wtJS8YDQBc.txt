OUTPUT:
Okay, here's a review of the provided ICLR 2024 submission, focusing on key aspects like novelty, clarity, experimental validation, and potential impact.

**Review**

This research focuses on addressing the challenges posed by delays, both constant and random, in reinforcement learning (RL) environments. The authors identify a significant limitation of existing methods: their difficulty in handling variable delays and the inefficiencies of state augmentation techniques. To overcome these limitations, they propose DEER (Delay-resilient Encoder-Enhanced RL), a framework that leverages a pretrained encoder to map delayed states and action sequences into a delay-free hidden state space suitable for standard RL algorithms.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The paper addresses a practically relevant problem (delays in RL) with a novel approach. The idea of using a pretrained encoder to create delay-invariant state representations is promising. The paper correctly identifies and addresses shortcomings of existing delay-handling methods in RL. The focus on *interpretability* is also a welcome aspect. DEER tackles both constant and random delays which is a very practical scenario.

*   **Clarity of Approach:** The paper provides a relatively clear description of the DEER framework. The two-stage process (pretraining the encoder and then using it for policy learning) is well-defined. The introduction of the RDDMDP formulation to formally capture the problem of random dropping delays is valuable. The figures (especially Figure 1 and 2) are helpful in understanding the overall architecture and pretraining process. Algorithm 1 clearly outlines the steps of the DEER framework.

*   **Experimental Validation:** The experimental setup is reasonably comprehensive. The authors evaluate DEER on a range of Gym and MuJoCo environments with both constant and random delays. The comparison with several existing delay-aware RL algorithms (RLRD, DATS, SACAS) strengthens the evaluation. The parameter sensitivity analysis and ablation study are also valuable components of the experimental section. The inclusion of an ablation study to show the importance of context representation is a strong point. The additional experiments in the appendix add more depth to the analysis.

*   **Reproducibility:** The paper includes implementation details, network structures, parameter configurations, and pseudocode, all of which contribute to the reproducibility of the results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Encoder Pretraining Data Dependency:** The paper highlights the sensitivity of DEER to the quantity and distribution of the pretraining trajectories (in section 5.5 and C.5). Although the authors attempt to explain this issue, it is still a significant weakness, and more analysis is required. How does one *a priori* determine the "correct" amount and type of data for pretraining the encoder for a *new* delayed task? The results with just random or just expert trajectories are illustrative, but the limitations section needs to be more prominent in the main paper. Is there a way to make the pretraining procedure more robust?

*   **Limited Novelty in Encoder Architecture:** The encoder architecture itself (Seq2Seq with GRUs) is relatively standard. The paper could benefit from a brief discussion of why this particular architecture was chosen and whether alternative encoder architectures were considered. Were simpler architectures attempted? This would help justify the architectural choices and provide insights into the importance of the encoder's capacity.

*   **Clarity of RDDMDP Definition:** While the RDDMDP formulation is a good step, the notation can be somewhat dense. More intuitive explanations and examples of how the random delay value (zt) and the information state (it) evolve would improve clarity.

*   **Justification of Normalization:** The normalization applied to rewards due to reward differences between DATS and other algorithms is not clearly justified. The paper states Return −min _return
Expert _return −min _return, but it lacks sufficient details on how min\_return and Expert\_return are defined and obtained for each environment. It would be helpful to see a comparative analysis of other normalization strategies and the potential impact of different normalization methods on the final results.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address Pretraining Data Sensitivity:** This is the biggest issue. Provide more guidance on how to select appropriate pretraining data for new tasks. Explore techniques to make the pretraining more robust to variations in data quality and quantity.

*   **Expand Justification of Encoder Architecture:** Briefly discuss the rationale behind the Seq2Seq/GRU architecture and whether other encoder architectures were explored.

*   **Improve RDDMDP Clarity:** Add more intuitive explanations and examples to clarify the RDDMDP formulation.

*   **Provide further details on reward normalization**: provide rationale on choice of the reward normalization used in experimental results.

*   **Elaborate on Time Consumption**: further analyze why RLRD and DATS incur excessive time consumption compared to DEER and SACAS.

*   **Broader Discussion of Related Work:** Expand the related work section to include a discussion on techniques such as imitation learning to improve on convergence for tasks where expert trajectories are available.

**Overall Assessment:**

This is a solid contribution to the field of reinforcement learning. The DEER framework offers a promising approach to handling delays, particularly in variable delay scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness compared to existing methods. Addressing the weaknesses related to pretraining data sensitivity and encoder architecture justification would further strengthen the paper.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend this paper for acceptance, conditional on addressing the points raised above. The work is novel, technically sound, and has the potential to make a valuable contribution to the RL community.
