OUTPUT:
This paper studies the subject of Granger causality inference in time series using neural networks. It proposes a novel MLP-based architecture called GC-Mixer for both time-invariant and time-varying Granger causality inference. The paper claims that GC-Mixer is more robust to hyperparameter changes and offers improved automatic lag selection compared to existing methods. The authors evaluate their model on VAR and Lorenz-96 datasets.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The proposed GC-Mixer architecture, particularly the use of an all-MLP architecture without convolutions or self-attention for Granger causality, is a novel contribution. The idea of extracting the causal matrix from the output of the Mixer Block is also interesting.
*   **Addressing a Limitation:** The paper correctly identifies the limitation of existing methods assuming time-invariance in Granger causality. The proposed multi-level fine-tuning algorithm to address this limitation is a valuable contribution.
*   **Clear Problem Statement:** The paper clearly articulates the problem of time-varying Granger causality inference and the shortcomings of existing methods.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The experiments cover different scenarios (sparsity, dimension, nonlinearity) on two commonly used datasets (VAR and Lorenz-96), providing a reasonable evaluation of the model's performance. The ablation study for the number of Mixer Blocks helps understand the influence of network depth.
*   **Automatic Lag Selection:** The paper highlights the ability of GC-Mixer to automatically select time lags, which is a significant advantage. The qualitative comparison with cMLP in this aspect is helpful.
*   **Well-written:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The figures are clear and help illustrate the proposed architecture and algorithm.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Lack of Theoretical Justification:** While the paper presents a novel architecture, it lacks a deeper theoretical justification for why the proposed Mixer Block and Causality Inference Block design are effective for Granger causality inference. A more formal connection to Granger causality principles would strengthen the paper.
*   **Limited Comparison in Time-Varying Setting:** The comparison in the time-varying setting is somewhat limited. Comparing against only manually split versions of existing methods feels weak. A stronger baseline could be some kind of adaptive VAR model or a sliding-window VAR model that re-estimates the parameters at each step. The paper also admits that some existing models were not compared at all due to not inferring time-varying Granger causality, suggesting further comparison is needed.
*   **Performance on Lorenz-96:** The performance of GC-Mixer on the Lorenz-96 dataset is less convincing, particularly for higher forcing terms (F=30, F=40). The paper acknowledges potential overfitting, but further investigation and mitigation strategies (e.g., regularization) would be beneficial.
*   **Threshold Dependence:** The Granger causality inference relies on a threshold ϵ (Equation 13). The paper does not provide much detail on how this threshold is chosen and how sensitive the results are to its value. A sensitivity analysis would be valuable.
*   **Clarity of Multi-Level Fine-tuning:** The explanation of the multi-level fine-tuning algorithm (Algorithm 1 and Figure 2) could be clearer. Specifically, the mechanism of transferring weights and biases from previous levels is not explained in detail. It would be helpful to provide a more concrete example or illustration. Also, there should be justification on why fine-tuning the entire network yields a good result.
*   **Time Complexity Claim:** The time complexity claimed (O((T−K+1)×p×2^(i−1))) seems very high. Is the *every* step of the process scaled by *every* dimension of the problem? This warrants further analysis.
*   **GV AR comparison:** In some scenarios GV AR outperforms the presented model, and its dropoff in performance with the Lorenz-96 data is not effectively explained. The advantages of GC-Mixer over GV AR are unclear.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Provide a stronger theoretical justification for the GC-Mixer architecture and its connection to Granger causality principles.**
*   **Include a more rigorous comparison in the time-varying setting, potentially with adaptive or sliding-window baselines.**
*   **Investigate and address the performance limitations on the Lorenz-96 dataset, potentially through regularization or other techniques.**
*   **Conduct a sensitivity analysis on the threshold ϵ and provide guidelines for its selection.**
*   **Provide a clearer explanation of the multi-level fine-tuning algorithm and the mechanism of transferring weights and biases.**
*   **Address or explain the computational complexity of the proposed solution.**
*   **Clarify the advantages of GC-Mixer over GV AR.**
*   **The writing could be improved in some places; there are a few grammatical errors (e.g., "Granger causal ityinference").**

**Overall:**

The paper presents a novel and promising approach for Granger causality inference. While it has some weaknesses, the contributions are significant, and the results are encouraging. Addressing the points raised above would significantly strengthen the paper and make it a more valuable contribution to the field. I recommend that the paper be considered for acceptance, pending revisions addressing the concerns outlined above.
