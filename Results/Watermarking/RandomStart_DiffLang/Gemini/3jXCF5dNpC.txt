Okay, here's a review of the provided ICLR 2024 conference paper submission.

**OVERALL ASSESSMENT**

This paper proposes a simple yet surprisingly effective prompting strategy, "Re-reading" (RE2), to improve reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). The core idea is that having the LLM re-read the input question enhances its understanding and reasoning capabilities. The paper presents experimental results on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrating performance improvements when RE2 is combined with existing prompting methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT).  The work is well-motivated, drawing inspiration from human problem-solving. The experiments are reasonably comprehensive. The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow.

**DETAILED REVIEW**

**Strengths:**

*   **Simplicity and Novelty:** The RE2 approach is remarkably simple to implement and requires minimal computational overhead. While prior work has explored re-reading strategies in deep learning, applying it as a targeted prompting technique for LLMs in this manner appears novel.
*   **Strong Experimental Results:** The experiments demonstrate consistent performance gains across several reasoning benchmarks (arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic) and with different LLMs (davinci-003, ChatGPT, and Llama-2). The consistent positive results, especially when combined with CoT, are compelling.
*   **Versatility:** The paper convincingly argues that RE2 is a "plug & play" module that can be integrated with various prompting strategies (CoT, Plan-and-Solve, Program-Aided Language Models), few-shot learning and self-consistency. This versatility is a significant advantage. The experiments supporting this claim are valuable.
*   **Good Motivation and Intuition:** The paper clearly articulates the motivation behind RE2, drawing parallels to human cognitive processes and addressing the limitations of single forward-pass decoder-only models. The connection to knowledge recall and query augmentation is also well-explained.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-structured, making it easy to understand the proposed method, experimental setup, and results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Theoretical Analysis:** While the paper provides intuitive explanations, a more rigorous theoretical analysis of *why* RE2 works could strengthen the paper. What aspects of the LLM architecture or training data make it receptive to this re-reading approach? Is it primarily improving attention, memory recall, or something else?
*   **Ablation Studies:**  The paper includes an ablation study on the number of re-readings. However, it would be beneficial to include more detailed ablation studies to analyze the impact of different re-reading *instructions.* Table 8 starts to address this, but the analysis could be expanded. What if, instead of repeating the *entire* question, only key entities or relationships are repeated? Would that be more effective? This could have been very interesting.
*   **ChatGPT performance degradation without CoT** The paper mentions the reduction in performance of ChatGPT when combined with the "Vanilla" prompting strategy without Chain of thought prompts. While some explanations have been provided, further experiments or analysis to investigate *why* this drop occurs would add value. Is it a consequence of the model's IFT training, or some other factor?
*   **Error Analysis:** While the paper reports accuracy metrics, a deeper error analysis would be beneficial. What types of questions does RE2 help the LLM answer correctly, and what types of errors does it still struggle with? Are there specific question characteristics that make RE2 more or less effective?
*   **Computational Cost:** While RE2 is presented as lightweight, the paper doesn't explicitly quantify the increase in inference time or computational cost due to re-reading. This should be included, even if it's relatively small.

**Specific Comments and Suggestions:**

*   **Figure 1:** While helpful, Figure 1 could be improved by highlighting the specific "re-read" portion of the input in the CoT+RE2 example.
*   **Equation 3:** The prompt template provided in Equation 3 is a bit too simplistic. Exploring more nuanced re-reading prompts (e.g., summarizing the question, rephrasing it, asking clarifying questions about it) could lead to further improvements.
*   **Appendix B:** The attention analysis section could be expanded. Provide more context and interpretation of the attention visualizations. Explain *how* the attention patterns change with RE2 and *why* that leads to better reasoning.
*   **Clarity of Language:** In a few places, the language could be more precise. For example, instead of saying RE2 facilitates "bidirectional" comprehension, it would be more accurate to say it allows the model to attend to the same information twice, potentially in different ways.
*   **Related Work:** the related work section is comprehensive, but could benefit from further distilling insights from reading strategies that align more closely with LLM prompt engineering. What from this body of research can be directly applied?

**Overall Recommendation:**

I recommend **acceptance** of this paper. The proposed RE2 prompting strategy is a simple, novel, and effective way to improve reasoning in LLMs. The experimental results are compelling, and the versatility of the approach is a significant strength. Addressing the weaknesses identified above would further enhance the paper's impact.

**Conference Paper Checklist Considerations:**

*   **Originality:** The core idea of targeted re-reading via prompting for LLMs appears original.
*   **Significance:** Improving reasoning in LLMs is a significant research area.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to understand.
*   **Soundness:** The experimental methodology seems sound, and the results are generally convincing.
*   **Impact:** The RE2 approach has the potential to be widely adopted due to its simplicity and effectiveness.
*   **Reproducibility:** The paper provides sufficient details to reproduce the experiments, although releasing code would further improve reproducibility.
