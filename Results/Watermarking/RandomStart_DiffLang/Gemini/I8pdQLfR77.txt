**Ce document explore le domaine clé** of improving the MLP module within Vision Transformers (ViTs). The paper presents a clear and well-motivated argument: while much research focuses on the self-attention mechanism in ViTs, the MLP module has received comparatively little attention. The authors propose an "Improved MLP" (IMLP) module, grounded in a theoretical analysis that frames the MLP as a non-linearity generator. The core idea is to enhance the non-linearity provided by the MLP, thereby allowing a reduction in the number of hidden dimensions and, consequently, computational cost (FLOPs and parameters). The approach involves using an "Arbitrary GeLU" (AGeLU) activation function and incorporating spatial enhancement via depthwise convolutions. Experimental results on ImageNet-1k and downstream tasks demonstrate the potential of the proposed IMLP module to reduce computational overhead without sacrificing accuracy.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Motivation and Problem Definition:** The paper clearly identifies a gap in the current ViT research landscape and articulates the problem being addressed.
*   **Theoretical Justification:** The analysis of the MLP module as a non-linearity generator provides a solid foundation for the proposed improvements. The corollary derived from this analysis is insightful.
*   **Novelty of the AGeLU Function:** The introduction of the AGeLU activation function and its demonstrated flexibility compared to other activation functions (like RPReLU) is a notable contribution.
*   **Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation:** The IMLP module is evaluated on a diverse set of ViT architectures (DeiT, Swin, PoolFormer, LVT) and shows consistent performance improvements across different model sizes. The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the contributions of different components of the IMLP module. The inclusion of results on object detection (COCO) and semantic segmentation (ADE20K) strengthens the impact of the work.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written, easy to follow, and logically organized. The figures are helpful in illustrating the concepts and results.
*   **Lipschitz Bound Analysis:** The theoretical analysis of the Lipschitz constant provides a valuable perspective on the stability and robustness of the proposed module.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Novelty in Spatial Enhancement:** While the channel-wise enhancement using AGeLU is well-motivated, the spatial enhancement using depthwise convolutions feels somewhat less novel. The connection to VanillaNet is made, but the idea of using convolutions to incorporate spatial information in ViTs is not entirely new. This section could be strengthened by providing more unique insights into the role of spatial information in enhancing non-linearity.
*   **Clarity of the Lipschitz Constant Calculation:** While the inclusion of the Lipschitz bound analysis is commendable, the practicality of computing the bound is not fully addressed. The paper states that the equation can be treated as an SDP, but it doesn't elaborate on the computational cost or scalability of solving this SDP for larger networks. It would be beneficial to discuss the challenges and potential limitations in practically applying this analysis.
*   **Marginal Improvements in Throughput:** The throughput results, while showing improvements on CPU, are only marginal on GPU. This could limit the practical impact of the proposed method in GPU-accelerated environments. This should be addressed in the discussion of the experimental results.
*   **Lack of comparison with other MLP replacement methods:** The paper mentions CMT and CoAtNet briefly but doesn't offer a direct comparison with those methods on ImageNet-1k under similar experimental settings, which could help strengthen the claim that IMLP is a superior modification of the MLP module.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Elaborate on the Spatial Enhancement:** Provide a more in-depth discussion on the motivation behind using depthwise convolutions for spatial enhancement. Perhaps connect it more explicitly to the non-linearity enhancement argument.
*   **Discuss the Scalability of Lipschitz Constant Calculation:** Acknowledge the potential limitations of the Lipschitz constant calculation and discuss possible strategies for addressing them.
*   **Compare with Existing MLP Replacement Methods:** Include a comparative analysis of IMLP with other MLP replacement methods (e.g., CMT, CoAtNet) on ImageNet-1k to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
*   **Address Marginal GPU Throughput Improvements:** Offer potential explanations for the marginal GPU throughput improvements and discuss how the IMLP module could be further optimized for GPU-accelerated environments.
*   **Minor Writing Suggestions:**
    *   Proofread carefully for minor grammatical errors.
    *   Ensure consistent formatting throughout the paper.

**Overall:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of Vision Transformers by focusing on the often-overlooked MLP module. The theoretical analysis, novel AGeLU activation function, and comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrate the potential of the proposed IMLP module to reduce computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. While there are areas for improvement, the paper is well-written, clearly motivated, and provides valuable insights into the role of the MLP module in ViTs. I would recommend acceptance with minor revisions addressing the points raised above.
