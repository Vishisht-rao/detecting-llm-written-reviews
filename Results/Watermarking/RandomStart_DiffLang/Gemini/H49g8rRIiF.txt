**Review**

This paper explores the key problem of adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs) for 3D point cloud perception. It proposes a novel method, LAMP (LAnguage Models reading Point clouds), which leverages the discrete nature of both language and point cloud data to transfer knowledge from frozen, pre-trained language models to the 3D domain. The core idea is to align the feature space of 3D point clouds with that of the PLM through a small, trainable projection network, thereby enabling the PLM to understand and process 3D data without requiring paired text-3D data. The paper further extends this concept to multimodal tasks, specifically 3D visual grounding, by using the same language encoder for both text and point clouds.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The paper presents a compelling and novel approach to 3D point cloud perception by exploring cross-modal knowledge transfer from language models. This direction is relatively unexplored and has the potential to offer new perspectives in the field. The idea of using frozen PLMs and only training a small projection network offers significant advantages in terms of computational efficiency and reduced data requirements. The finding that a pre-trained language model can be adapted for 3D vision tasks with minimal adjustment is significant.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The proposed LAMP framework is technically well-defined, with clear explanations of the point tokenization process, cross-modal self-attention learning (CMSA), and cross-modal cross-attention learning (CMCA) strategies. The mathematical formulations of the attention mechanisms are clearly presented.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The paper provides extensive experimental results on various unimodal (3D object classification and semantic segmentation) and multimodal (3D visual grounding) tasks. The results demonstrate that LAMP achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, including those specifically designed for 3D vision. The ablation studies provide insights into the importance of different design choices. The analysis of performance under long-tailed distributions and out-of-domain scenarios is particularly valuable. Also, the effiency experiments with detailed metrics on training parameters, GFLOPs, and Inference speed are helpful to show the merits of this method.
*   **Clarity and Organization:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The introduction clearly motivates the research problem and highlights the contributions of the work. The related work section provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches in multimodal pre-training, point-oriented networks, and cross-modal knowledge transfer to point clouds. The method section provides details on the proposed framework including the different steps. The experimental setup is well defined and clear.
*   **Reproducibility:** The paper provides a link to the source code with detailed documentation and mentions details such as datasets information and implementations, suggesting a commitment to reproducibility.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity in Attention Details:** While the CMSA and CMCA mechanisms are described, further detail regarding how the learned projection networks integrate with the language encoder could be provided. Also, it's not clear if attention layers are changed completely, or if the attention mechanisms are only added to certain layers.
*   **Tokenizer Choice:** While the point tokenization is described, there is no exploration of different point tokenization strategies, or whether the choice of tokenization strategy impacts performance, or why the 1/4 sampling rate was chosen.
*   **Limited discussion on Limitations:** It would be beneficial to include a discussion of the limitations of the current approach. For example, what types of 3D perception tasks are not well-suited for this method? Are there specific types of point cloud data (e.g., very sparse, highly noisy) that pose challenges? How does the choice of PLM impact the performance of LAMP? A frank discussion of the method's limitations would strengthen the paper.
*   **Visualizations:** The visualizations in the appendix are helpful, but higher quality or more varied visualizations (e.g., attention maps) illustrating how the PLM attends to different parts of the point cloud could be useful for providing a deeper understanding.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Provide more details about the attention mechanisms:** Clarify the integration process of learned projections with the language encoder's attention layers and the process of implementation.
*   **Discuss the choice of point tokenizer:** Add a discussion of tokenizer choices and impact on performance.
*   **Discuss limitations:** Add a paragraph (or section) that openly discusses the limitations of the proposed approach.
*   **Expand visualizations:** Include higher quality visualizations or additional visualizations to improve understanding of the method.
*   **Typographical errors:** Proofread the paper to correct minor typographical errors and improve overall readability.

**Overall Recommendation:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and promising approach to 3D point cloud perception. The experimental results are compelling, and the paper is generally well-written and organized. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact. I recommend this paper for acceptance, contingent on addressing the above suggestions.
