OUTPUT:
This research explores the context of causal discovery in multivariate time series data, a challenging problem relevant to many fields. The paper introduces CASTOR, a novel framework for learning causal relationships in time series with multiple regimes, each governed by a distinct causal graph. The method aims to simultaneously infer the number of regimes, learn regime indices, and discover causal relationships (linear or non-linear) within each regime. This is achieved through maximizing a score function using the EM algorithm.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses an important problem:** Causal discovery in time series data with multiple, unknown regimes is a significant and realistic challenge. Many existing methods assume a single regime, which limits their applicability.
*   **Novelty:** The paper proposes a novel approach (CASTOR) that addresses the simultaneous learning of causal graphs, regime numbers, and regime indices, which, to the best of the authors' knowledge, is unprecedented.
*   **Clear Framework Description:** The paper provides a well-defined framework for CASTOR, detailing the mathematical formulation, including the linear and non-linear cases, and the EM algorithm.
*   **Theoretical Guarantees:** The inclusion of theoretical underpinnings that ensure the robustness of CASTOR, provides support of the causal discovery method.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The method is empirically validated with extensive synthetic experiments and real-world benchmarks. The results demonstrate CASTOR's superior performance compared to baselines in causal discovery.
*   **Interpretability:** CASTOR establishes itself as a distinctly interpretable method by learning a full temporal causal graph for each regime.
*   **Well-written and organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the proposed approach.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Complexity of the EM Algorithm:** The paper may benefit from a more accessible explanation of the EM algorithm, perhaps with visual aids, to make it easier for readers without a strong background to understand.
*   **Limited Real-World Benchmarks:** While two real-world benchmarks are included, expanding this section with additional datasets and more detailed discussions would strengthen the practical relevance of the method.
*   **Computational Cost:** While the paper mentions CASTOR's speed compared to some methods, a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity and scalability of CASTOR would be valuable, especially for high-dimensional time series data.
*   **Assumption of Causal Sufficiency:** The paper assumes causal sufficiency, which might not hold in many real-world scenarios. It would be beneficial to discuss the limitations of CASTOR under violations of this assumption and potential future directions for addressing latent confounders.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **EM Algorithm Explanation:** Add a more intuitive explanation of the EM algorithm and how it is applied within the CASTOR framework.
*   **Expand Real-World Experiments:** Include additional real-world benchmark datasets to showcase the method's applicability in diverse domains. Provide more detailed analysis and justification for the choice of datasets and their relevance to the problem.
*   **Complexity Analysis:** Add a discussion of the computational complexity of CASTOR, including its scalability to high-dimensional time series data.
*   **Address Causal Sufficiency Limitation:** Discuss the limitations imposed by the assumption of causal sufficiency and potential strategies for handling latent confounders.
*   **Ablation Studies on Key Components:** Although there are ablation studies, including a deeper analysis of CASTOR, focusing on the effects of the predetermined window for index initialization (Figure 3) would strengthen the empirical results.

**Overall:**

CASTOR is a promising framework for causal discovery in multivariate time series data with multiple regimes. The paper presents a novel approach, provides theoretical guarantees, and demonstrates superior performance compared to baselines in synthetic and real-world experiments. By improving the clarity of the EM algorithm explanation, expanding the real-world benchmark, addressing the limitations of causal sufficiency, and a deeper analysis of the key components of CASTOR, the paper could be even stronger.

**Recommendation:**

Accept with minor revisions. The strengths of the paper outweigh the weaknesses, and the proposed method makes a significant contribution to the field of causal discovery. Addressing the suggestions for improvement will further enhance the quality of the paper.
