OUTPUT:
The manuscript addresses a critical aspect of causal inference, namely the problem of post-treatment bias, which arises when covariates are affected by the treatment itself. The paper provides a clear explanation of how ignoring or mishandling these post-treatment variables can lead to biased estimates of treatment effects. The authors propose a novel variable decomposition approach, PoNet, based on a newly proposed causal graph, to mitigate this bias. The method is evaluated on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world data, demonstrating promising results compared to existing methods.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses an Important Problem:** The paper tackles a significant challenge in causal inference that is often overlooked by traditional methods. The discussion of mediation and collider post-treatment variables is clear and insightful.
*   **Novel Approach:** The proposed variable decomposition approach, PoNet, is a novel attempt to address post-treatment bias. The causal graph provides a solid foundation for the proposed method.
*   **Thorough Evaluation:** The paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method on a variety of datasets, including synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world data. The comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines are thorough. The ablation studies and analysis of the inference policy variants are particularly valuable.
*   **Clear and Well-Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The introduction clearly motivates the problem, and the methodology is explained in a logical manner.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Novelty of Causal Graph:** While the idea of focusing on mediation and collider variables is good, the causal graph doesn't seem radically different from existing causal diagrams used in mediation analysis. The paper could benefit from a stronger argument about the uniqueness and advantages of the proposed causal graph compared to existing literature.
*   **Clarity of Theorems:** While Theorem 1 and 2 add to the theoretical appeal, their practical implications for *designing* the PoNet architecture or *interpreting* its results need to be clarified. Do these theorems directly inform the loss function or network architecture, or are they primarily justifications for the approach?
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The paper mentions several hyperparameters (α, β, γ, η) in the overall loss function. A discussion of the sensitivity of the results to these hyperparameters and guidelines for setting them would be beneficial. Are there any principled ways to choose these values, or is it purely based on experimentation?
*   **Details in Appendix:** Many important details (data generation, proof of theorems, details of Optimal Transport) are relegated to the Appendix. While space is limited, briefly summarizing key aspects of the appendix material in the main paper, or pointing out *which* details are critical, would help the reader grasp the full picture.
*   **Limited Discussion on Assumptions:** While the paper mentions the independence of U and T, a more explicit discussion of the assumptions underlying the proposed method would be helpful. For example, what are the limitations of the approach if the assumed causal structure is incorrect?
*   **Writing and Formatting Issues:** There are a few instances of awkward phrasing, grammatical errors, and inconsistencies in formatting throughout the text. A thorough proofread would be beneficial. For example, "mode1" in section 4.1 should be "model".

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Strengthen the justification for the proposed causal graph:** Provide a more compelling argument for its novelty and advantages over existing causal diagrams.
*   **Clarify the practical implications of the theorems:** Explain how Theorems 1 and 2 directly inform the design and implementation of the PoNet model.
*   **Discuss hyperparameter sensitivity:** Provide guidelines for setting the hyperparameters and discuss the sensitivity of the results to their values.
*   **Incorporate key details from the appendix:** Briefly summarize important details from the appendix in the main paper to improve readability and understanding.
*   **Discuss the limitations of the approach:** Explicitly state the assumptions underlying the method and discuss its limitations if those assumptions are violated.
*   **Thoroughly proofread the paper:** Correct any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and formatting inconsistencies.
*   **Explain the intuition behind the reconstruction module:** While its formulation is clear, further elaborating on *why* reconstruction helps, especially given collider variables' impact on the outcome is indirect, would benefit readers.
*   **Consider a Semi-synthetic Experiment without *known* confounders:** Does the method still function well when the confounders aren't explicitly engineered in the simulated data, but rather emerge from the data itself?

**Overall:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of causal inference by addressing the important problem of post-treatment bias. The proposed method, PoNet, shows promising results on a variety of datasets. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
