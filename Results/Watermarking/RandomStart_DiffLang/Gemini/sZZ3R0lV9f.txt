**OVERALL ASSESSMENT**

This paper presents MixDiff, a novel and interesting approach to out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in scenarios where access to model internals (activations, parameters, gradients) is limited, a problem becoming increasingly relevant with the rise of ML-as-a-service. The core idea of using input-level perturbations (Mixup) to compare the behavior of a target sample against similar in-distribution (ID) samples is clever and well-motivated. The paper provides a theoretical justification for why this approach can be effective, particularly in mitigating overconfidence issues. Empirical results demonstrate consistent improvements in OOD detection performance across various datasets and under different levels of access restriction, even in extreme scenarios where only prediction labels are available. The paper is generally well-written and organized, although some sections could benefit from more clarity.
Here is a detailed breakdown of my assessment:

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Relevance:** The problem of OOD detection in constrained access environments is highly relevant, and MixDiff offers a novel and practical solution. The approach is particularly appealing because it addresses a significant limitation of many existing OOD detection methods.
*   **Sound Motivation:** The intuition behind MixDiff – that contributing features in misclassified samples are more sensitive to perturbations – is well-explained and convincing. The class activation map visualization in Figure 1 helps to illustrate this intuition effectively.
*   **Theoretical Analysis:** The theoretical analysis provides valuable insight into why MixDiff works. The decomposition of the OOD score function (Proposition 1) and the analysis of the perturb-and-compare strategy (Theorem 1) lend credibility to the approach.
*   **Comprehensive Empirical Evaluation:** The experimental results are thorough and convincing. The paper evaluates MixDiff on a diverse set of datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, CIFAR+10, CIFAR+50, TinyImageNet, and text datasets) and compares it against several strong baselines, including both training-free and training-based methods. The ablation studies provide further insight into the contribution of each component of MixDiff. The application to out-of-scope intent detection demonstrates the versatility of the approach. The analysis under adversarial attacks demonstrates the methods robustness.
*   **Adaptability to Different Access Levels:** The paper successfully demonstrates the applicability of MixDiff under various access constraints, highlighting its practical value in real-world scenarios. The ability to function even when only prediction labels are available is a particularly noteworthy achievement.
*   **Well-Organized and Generally Well-Written:** The paper follows a logical structure and is generally easy to follow. The introduction clearly lays out the problem and the proposed solution, and the related work section provides a good overview of the existing literature.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity in Explanations:** Some parts of the methodology section (Section 3) and the theoretical analysis (Section 3.1) could be explained more clearly. For example, the notation used in the equations can be dense and difficult to parse quickly. A more intuitive explanation of the connection between the theoretical results and the practical implementation would be beneficial.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** While the paper mentions performing hyperparameter search on Caltech101 and using the same hyperparameters across all other datasets, it would be helpful to discuss the sensitivity of MixDiff to the choice of hyperparameters. Are there specific datasets or models for which MixDiff is more or less sensitive to hyperparameter settings? Also, given the improvement when hyperparameters are tuned to the validation data for ZOC (section E.4), maybe it would be important to mention if the hyperparameters were also optimized by dataset for the experiments involving other OOD scores.
*   **Computational Cost:** While the authors acknowledge the computational overhead of MixDiff, the discussion could be expanded. A more detailed analysis of the time and space complexity would be valuable, as would a comparison of the computational cost of MixDiff against other OOD detection methods. Also, the compute cost could vary drastically depending on if the base OOD method is performed on the logit or probability space. This should be clarified.
*   **Lack of comparison to the other methods that use mixup in the black box setting**: Even if the focus is on constrained access scenarios, there exist some other methods that utilize input level mixup which are cited in the introduction. It would be a good idea to add these in the experimental benchmark.
*   **"Negative Results" and Failure Cases:** It would be beneficial to discuss any limitations of MixDiff or situations where it fails to improve OOD detection performance. Are there specific types of OOD samples or model architectures for which MixDiff is less effective? This information would help to provide a more balanced assessment of the approach.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Improve Clarity:** Revise the methodology and theoretical analysis sections to improve clarity and readability. Consider using more intuitive explanations and providing more concrete examples.
*   **Discuss Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** Add a discussion of the sensitivity of MixDiff to the choice of hyperparameters. Provide guidance on how to select appropriate hyperparameter values for different datasets and models.
*   **Provide a More Detailed Computational Cost Analysis:** Expand the discussion of the computational overhead of MixDiff. Compare its time and space complexity against other OOD detection methods.
*   **Discuss Limitations and Failure Cases:** Add a discussion of any limitations of MixDiff or situations where it fails to improve OOD detection performance.
*   **Minor Edits:**
    *   In the practical implementation for the computation of the mixdiff score, the number of oracle computations is fixed. Add this constraint to Algorithm 1 and clarify how it is achieved.
    *   The method to determine which auxiliary samples would be prepended or appended is not well defined. Clarify this point.
    *   Proofread the paper carefully to correct any typos or grammatical errors.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, this is a strong paper that presents a novel, well-motivated, and empirically validated approach to OOD detection in constrained access environments. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field and is likely to be of interest to a wide audience. I recommend acceptance, pending revisions to address the weaknesses and suggestions outlined above.
