**Review**

This study addresses a critical and timely topic: the design of long-term group fair policies in dynamical systems. The paper tackles the limitations of static fairness notions, which often neglect the feedback loops between algorithmic decisions and their impact on individuals, leading to unintended consequences and potential amplification of biases over time. The paper proposes a novel framework for achieving long-term group fairness by identifying a time-independent policy that converges to a targeted fair stationary state, regardless of the initial data distribution. This is achieved by modeling the system dynamics with a time-homogeneous Markov chain and optimizing the policy using the Markov chain convergence theorem.

**Strengths:**

*   **Relevance and Significance:** The problem being addressed is highly relevant to real-world applications of algorithmic decision-making, especially in areas like credit lending, resource allocation, and social welfare. The long-term perspective on fairness is crucial for building truly equitable systems.
*   **Novelty:** The proposed framework offers a novel approach to achieving long-term fairness by explicitly considering the dynamic interplay between decisions and their impact on the data distribution. The use of Markov chains to model system dynamics and the application of the Markov chain convergence theorem is a sound and theoretically grounded approach.
*   **Clarity of Problem Definition:** The paper clearly articulates the limitations of existing static fairness notions and motivates the need for a dynamic approach. The guiding example in Section 2 effectively illustrates the problem and the potential benefits of the proposed framework.
*   **Generality of the Framework:** The framework is presented as being applicable to various (causal) models and long-term fairness targets. The paper demonstrates this with examples of different targeted fair states and fairness criteria.
*   **Optimization Problem Formulation:** The reformulation of the long-term fairness objective into a computationally solvable optimization problem is a significant contribution. The paper provides specific details on how to solve the optimization problem for the case of a finite state space.
*   **Simulations and Validation:** The semi-synthetic simulations provide empirical evidence of the framework's effectiveness. The simulations demonstrate that the policy solutions converge to the targeted stationary states and that the approach can help analyze the interplay between long-term targets and dynamics.
*   **Well-Organized and Readable:** The paper is generally well-organized and easy to follow. The introduction clearly outlines the problem, the proposed solution, and the contributions of the paper.

**Weaknesses and Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Assumptions and Limitations:** The paper acknowledges the assumptions of a time-homogeneous kernel and access to the dynamics but could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the implications of these assumptions. Specifically:
    *   **Time-Homogeneity:** The assumption of static dynamics might not hold in many real-world scenarios. How sensitive is the framework to violations of this assumption? Could adaptive or online learning techniques be incorporated to handle time-varying dynamics?
    *   **Causal Knowledge:** Access to dynamics is assumed but difficult to acquire in many real-world systems. The paper mentions expert knowledge, but this can lead to confirmation bias. Are there ways to learn the dynamics from observational data, even with potential confounding factors? How does the performance of the framework degrade with inaccuracies in the estimated dynamics?
    *   **State Space:** The paper focuses primarily on discrete state spaces, which simplifies the optimization problem. Extending the framework to continuous or high-dimensional state spaces is a significant challenge that requires further investigation. The discussion of this limitation is somewhat brief.
*   **Convergence Time:** While the simulations demonstrate convergence, the paper doesn't thoroughly analyze the convergence time and its dependence on various factors, such as the dynamics, initial distribution, and fairness constraints. Understanding and potentially mitigating slow convergence is crucial for practical applications. Short-term fairness challenges of policy convergence are briefly mentioned but could be emphasized more.
*   **Clarity of Generalization**: While the paper argues for a general principle, much of the framing and example is within the credit lending context. The paper would benefit from further elaboration of how the framework could be applied to other domains.
*   **Comparison with Other Approaches:** The paper briefly mentions other approaches to fair sequential decision-making, such as reinforcement learning. A more detailed comparison with these approaches, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each, would be valuable. What are the computational trade-offs? What are the data requirements?
*   **Implementation Details:** While the paper provides some details on the optimization process, more information on the specific algorithms used, the parameter settings, and the computational resources required would be helpful for reproducibility.
*    **The Non-Existence Case:** The paper argues that when a solution to the optimization problem does not exist, this may prompt practitioners to explore alternative approaches for long-term fairness. I agree with this sentiment but wonder if there's a method to pre-determine (or at least give an early warning) that a solution is unlikely to exist. I also think that further advice on what to do in that case (beyond simply redefining the fair state) is needed.
*   **Limited Exploration of Policy Space:** The framework seems to focus on finding a *single* optimal policy. Are there benefits to exploring a set of policies that achieve similar long-term fairness goals but have different short-term effects? Could this allow for more flexible adaptation to changing circumstances or societal preferences?

**Specific Comments:**

*   **Abstract:** The abstract is well-written and provides a clear summary of the paper's contributions.
*   **Introduction:** The introduction effectively motivates the problem and outlines the paper's approach.
*   **Definitions:** The definitions of Markov chains, stationary distributions, irreducibility, and aperiodicity are clear and concise.
*   **Optimization Problem:** The formulation of the optimization problem is well-defined and mathematically sound.
*   **Simulations:** The simulations provide valuable empirical evidence of the framework's effectiveness.
*   **Discussion:** The discussion section acknowledges some of the limitations of the approach, but could be expanded to address some of the points raised above.
*   **Appendix:** Consider moving some of the details from the appendix into the main body of the paper, especially if they are crucial for understanding the framework.

**Overall Recommendation:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of fair algorithmic decision-making. The proposed framework is novel, theoretically sound, and empirically validated. The paper has potential for high impact in the community. I recommend acceptance, pending revisions that address the weaknesses and suggestions for improvement outlined above. Addressing the limitations related to time-homogeneity, causal knowledge, convergence time, and comparison with other approaches would significantly strengthen the paper.
