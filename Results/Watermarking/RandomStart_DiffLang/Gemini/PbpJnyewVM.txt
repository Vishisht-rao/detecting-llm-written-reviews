Here's a review of the paper "ZERO-SHOT CROSS -TASK PREFERENCE ALIGNMENT FOR OFFLINE RL VIA OPTIMAL TRANSPORT," focusing on key areas of contribution, clarity, methodology, experiments, and overall impact.

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper presents a novel and promising approach to zero-shot cross-task preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL). It addresses the significant challenge of data scarcity in PbRL by leveraging preference data from source tasks to infer labels for target tasks, thus reducing the need for expensive human labeling.  The proposed method, Preference Optimal Transport (POT), utilizes Gromov-Wasserstein distance to align trajectory distributions, and Robust Preference Transformer (RPT) is introduced to handle the inherent noise in the transferred labels. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on robotic manipulation tasks. The paper is generally well-written and the ideas are clearly presented.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The application of Gromov-Wasserstein distance for cross-task preference transfer in offline RL is novel. The idea of aligning trajectory distributions directly, rather than representations, is a distinct contribution. The RPT, designed for robust learning from noisy labels, is also a valuable addition.
*   **Significance:** The problem addressed is highly relevant. Reducing human labeling costs in RL is a critical step towards broader applicability. The zero-shot transfer capability of the proposed method has the potential to significantly impact the field.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is well-structured and the explanation of the algorithm is generally clear. The figures and tables effectively illustrate the method and results. The related work section is thorough and positions the work well within the existing literature.
*   **Methodology:** The combination of POT and RPT is well-motivated. The use of distributional reward modeling to account for label noise is a sound approach. The derivation of the POT label and the design of RPT are technically solid.
*   **Experiments:** The experiments on Meta-World and Robomimic provide strong empirical validation of the proposed approach. The comparisons to existing methods are comprehensive, and the ablation studies offer insights into the impact of different components. The results in the few-shot learning setting are particularly compelling.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors have provided sufficient details about the implementation, hyperparameters, and datasets used in their experiments. The commitment to providing source code further enhances the reproducibility of the work.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Computational Cost:** The paper mentions a limitation in the conclusion concerning high-dimensional inputs, which may be related to the computational complexity of Gromov-Wasserstein distance calculations.  A more detailed discussion of the computational cost of the POT algorithm, including its scaling with the number of trajectories and state dimensionality, would be beneficial. It is important to understand the constraints in scalability of this approach.
*   **Task Similarity:** While the method shows promising results, the degree of similarity between source and target tasks is an important factor. The paper assumes a task distribution p(T) where tasks share the same action space. A more in-depth discussion of the types of tasks for which POT is most effective, and the limitations when tasks are very dissimilar, would be valuable.
*   **Cost Function Justification:** While the experiments explore Euclidean and Cosine distance, a deeper justification for these choices in the context of trajectory alignment would strengthen the paper. Are there theoretical reasons or domain-specific knowledge that favors one over the other? Are there other distance metrics considered and why were they rejected?
*   **Variance Collapse Prevention:** The method to prevent variance collapse and force the uncertainty level to maintain a level η is not sufficiently justified. Why do we want to keep a certain minimum level of uncertainty, and why is the entropy a good objective for it? What is the effect of choosing higher or lower values of η.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Computational Complexity Analysis:** Provide a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the POT algorithm.
*   **Task Similarity Discussion:** Expand the discussion on the types of tasks for which POT is well-suited and the limitations when tasks are very dissimilar.
*   **Cost Function Rationale:** Provide a more in-depth justification for the cost functions used in the Gromov-Wasserstein distance calculation.
*   **Variance Collapse Prevention:** Provide more information about the hyperparameter η and the objectives of the regularization term.
*   **Broader Impact:** Briefly address the broader ethical and societal implications of zero-shot cross-task preference learning. For example, could this technique be used to transfer biases or undesirable behaviors from one task to another?

**Conclusion:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach to zero-shot cross-task preference-based RL. The proposed method has the potential to significantly reduce human labeling costs and broaden the applicability of PbRL algorithms. Addressing the suggested improvements would further enhance the paper's impact and solidify its contribution to the field.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend accepting this paper, contingent upon addressing the above comments and suggestions.
