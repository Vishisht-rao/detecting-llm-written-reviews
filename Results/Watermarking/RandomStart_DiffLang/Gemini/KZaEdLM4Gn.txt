OUTPUT:
This study focuses on the key problem of enabling large language models (LLMs) to perform better compositional reasoning, particularly in dialogue systems, by leveraging "conceptual tools" in addition to the traditional "functional tools" they currently utilize. The paper proposes a novel multi-persona collaboration framework called Think-Plan-Execute (TPE) to enhance LLMs' ability to reason and plan with these conceptual tools.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty of the Conceptual Tool Idea:** The paper introduces a compelling and novel concept of "conceptual tools" which expands the definition of tools beyond functional APIs and programs. This is a valuable contribution to the field, suggesting a way for LLMs to leverage cognitive concepts (like source types or reasoning strategies) for more sophisticated reasoning. The examples provided (source and strategy selection) are concrete and relevant.
*   **TPE Framework Design:** The TPE framework is well-structured and logically sound. Decoupling the response generation process into Thinker, Planner, and Executor roles promotes explainability, controllability, and potentially reduces redundancy. The description of each role is clear, and the framework seems well-suited for complex dialogue scenarios.
*   **Empirical Evaluation:** The paper presents a thorough experimental evaluation across three datasets (FoCus, CIMA, PsyQA). Comparing TPE against strong supervised and unsupervised baselines, including various Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches, demonstrates its effectiveness and efficiency. The consistent performance gains across multiple datasets and metrics strengthens the paper's claims.
*   **Detailed Analysis:** The analysis section provides valuable insights into the performance of TPE. The investigation of retrieval effects in source planning, the analysis of strategy planning, and the ablation study on in-context learning components add depth to the paper and provide a deeper understanding of TPE's workings. The detailed experimental analysis (efficiency, retriever types, demonstrations selection) further strengthens the paper.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors commit to releasing the code and data, enhancing reproducibility. The inclusion of detailed prompt information in the appendix is also commendable.

**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Clarity of the Introduction:** While the introduction presents a good overview, it could be more concise and focused. The initial discussion of "tools" in general might benefit from being shortened to more immediately highlight the distinction between functional and conceptual tools.
*   **Motivation for Multi-Persona Collaboration:** While the paper mentions inspiration from multi-persona collaboration, the specific reasons why this approach is particularly effective for conceptual tool planning could be further emphasized. A stronger justification for *why* decoupling into these specific roles is beneficial would be useful. What are the specific pitfalls of a single LLM attempting the entire process?
*   **GPT-4 Results Explanation:** The unexpected results with GPT-4 in the multi-source dialogue tasks are interesting but require further investigation. While the paper suggests hallucinations due to persona information not being stored in the model parameters, this could be elaborated upon with specific examples or a more rigorous analysis of the types of errors GPT-4 makes.
*   **Human Evaluation Metrics:** Describing more detail on what quality scores were given in terms of each data set (correctness, inspiration, etc) would add to the human evaluation.
*   **DPR Finetuning Details:** More information about the finetuning process of DPR retriever would be helpful.

**Overall Assessment:**

This is a strong paper that addresses an important and timely research question. The introduction of conceptual tools and the TPE framework offers a novel and promising approach to enhancing LLMs' compositional reasoning capabilities in dialogue systems. The extensive experiments, detailed analysis, and commitment to reproducibility make this a valuable contribution to the field. While some areas could benefit from further clarification and elaboration, the paper is well-written, well-researched, and likely to be of significant interest to the ICLR community. I recommend acceptance, contingent upon addressing the suggested improvements.
