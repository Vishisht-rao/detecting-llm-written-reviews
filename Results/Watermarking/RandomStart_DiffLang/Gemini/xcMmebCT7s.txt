**Review of "Learning to Design Protein–Protein Interactions with Enhanced Generalization"**

**Overall Summary:**

This paper addresses the crucial problem of designing protein-protein interactions (PPIs) with improved generalization capabilities. It identifies key limitations of existing machine learning approaches, including dataset redundancy, data leakage in train-test splits, and overfitting. To overcome these challenges, the authors introduce PPIRef, a large and non-redundant PPI dataset, and PPIformer, a novel SE(3)-equivariant transformer model. They pre-train PPIformer on PPIRef and fine-tune it for predicting the effects of mutations on PPI binding affinity. The paper demonstrates enhanced generalization performance on standard datasets and independent case studies, showcasing the potential for optimizing antibodies and thrombolytic activity.

**Key Strengths:**

*   **Significant Problem:** The paper tackles a relevant and important problem in biomedical research and biotechnology. Designing effective PPIs has broad applications in therapeutics and biosensors.
*   **Novel Dataset:** The creation of PPIRef is a valuable contribution. Addressing data redundancy and biases in PPI datasets is essential for reliable machine learning. The iDist algorithm provides a scalable solution for identifying near-duplicate PPI interfaces.
*   **Innovative Model:** The PPIformer architecture, leveraging SE(3)-equivariance and a thermodynamically-motivated loss function, is a well-designed approach for learning from coarse-grained PPI representations. This model addresses some issues of the current methods.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The paper presents compelling evidence that PPIformer outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on challenging test sets, including those with reduced data leakage. The independent case studies on antibody optimization and staphylokinase engineering provide practical validation of the model's effectiveness.
*   **Clear and Well-Written:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it accessible to readers familiar with the field. The introduction clearly outlines the problem and contributions, and the methodology is described in sufficient detail.
*   **Comprehensive Ablation Studies:** These show key components contribute.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited novelty of approach:** While the approach is good, some methods have been already used (Equiformer model).
*   **Reliance on existing architecture:** While it leverages the Equiformer architecture effectively, it might benefit from exploring more novel architectural designs specifically tailored to PPI modeling in future work.
*   **Flex ddG outperforming ML:** The conclusion that Flex ddG outperforms ML in the non-leaking test sets is important, but it needs to be balanced by stating that Flex ddG is orders of magnitude slower. A direct speed comparison in the main paper would be beneficial.
*   **Clarity on PPIRef Composition:** While the paper describes the construction of PPIRef, more details on the types of PPIs included (e.g., specific protein families, interaction types) would be useful for understanding its representativeness.
*   **Statistical Significance:** While the tables show results with standard deviations, a more formal statistical analysis (e.g., t-tests) to demonstrate the significance of the improvements achieved by PPIformer over the baselines would strengthen the claims.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Speed Comparison:** Include a concrete speed comparison of PPIformer and Flex ddG in the main text. The difference of 5 orders of magnitude is critical.
*   **PPIRef Characterization:** Provide a more detailed characterization of the PPIs included in PPIRef, including the distribution of different protein families and interaction types.
*   **Statistical Significance Testing:** Perform statistical significance tests to validate the improvements achieved by PPIformer over the baselines.
*   **Error Analysis:** Provide a discussion of the types of mutations or PPIs where PPIformer still struggles, and suggest potential directions for future research to address these limitations.
*   **Broader Baselines:** Consider including additional baselines, particularly other geometric deep learning methods for protein structure analysis.
*   **Computational Cost:** Provide more specific details on the computational resources required for pre-training and fine-tuning PPIformer.
*   **Limitations of Metrics:** Provide a more extensive analysis of the evaluation metrics and their limitations, as well as the potential for biases in the case studies.

**Overall Recommendation:**

This is a strong paper that makes significant contributions to the field of protein-protein interaction design. The novel dataset, innovative model architecture, and compelling empirical results demonstrate the potential for enhanced generalization in PPI design. Addressing the minor weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements would further strengthen the paper and make it an even more valuable contribution to the community. It is recommended for acceptance, subject to addressing the points above.
