**Review of "Improved Probabilistic Image-Text Representations"**

This manuscript examines a critical subject within the vision-language (VL) domain: Image-Text Matching (ITM). The paper tackles the inherent ambiguity present in ITM tasks, stemming from the multiplicity of valid descriptions for a single image and the sparseness of annotations in existing datasets (leading to a large number of false negatives). The authors argue convincingly that deterministic embedding approaches struggle to effectively represent this ambiguity and propose an improved probabilistic embedding method called PCME++. The key innovations of PCME++ include a novel "Closed-Form Sampled Distance" (CSD) that avoids the computational expense of Monte Carlo approximations, and two optimization techniques: the incorporation of pseudo-positives and mixed sample data augmentation. The experimental results on MS-COCO Caption and extended benchmarks (CxC and ECCV Caption) demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of PCME++ compared to state-of-the-art ITM methods. The authors also showcase the potential applicability of PCME++ in automatic prompt-filtering for zero-shot classification, highlighting the versatility of their approach.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses an Important Problem:** The paper clearly identifies and articulates the limitations of deterministic ITM methods in the face of inherent ambiguity. The explanation of the false negative problem and its impact on embedding spaces is well-presented.
*   **Novelty of the Proposed Method:** PCME++ introduces a novel probabilistic distance (CSD) with a closed-form solution, which is a significant improvement over previous probabilistic ITM approaches that rely on computationally expensive Monte Carlo approximations. The two optimization techniques (pseudo-positives and mixed sample data augmentation) are also well-motivated and contribute to the overall performance of the method.
*   **Solid Experimental Evaluation:** The paper presents a comprehensive experimental evaluation on multiple datasets (MS-COCO, CxC, ECCV Caption) and under different settings (including noisy correspondences). The comparison with state-of-the-art methods is thorough, and the ablation studies provide insights into the contribution of each component of PCME++.
*   **Versatile Application:** The demonstration of PCME++'s applicability to automatic prompt-filtering for zero-shot classification is a valuable addition. It highlights the broader potential of the learned uncertainty representations.
*   **Clarity and Writing Quality:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the proposed method and experimental results. The figures are helpful in illustrating the concepts and results. The pseudo code also helps with understanding the implementation.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited comparisons to other efficient SOTA methods.** Table C.1 showcases that PCME++ performs well in this setting.
*   **Computational Cost:** While PCME++ improves upon the computational cost of PCME, it could be beneficial to provide more detailed comparisons of the computational cost (training and inference time, memory usage) compared to deterministic methods like VSE++. While the paper mentions 33% speed improvement compared to PCME, providing comparisons with more baseline models is needed.
*   **Choice of Baselines:**  The paper primarily compares against VSE++ and InfoNCE.  It would be helpful to include comparisons against other strong, recent ITM methods, especially those that also aim to address the false negative problem (even if those approaches are deterministic).
*   **ImageNet Prompt Filtering:** The ImageNet prompt filtering experiment lacks a proper validation split, which makes it difficult to assess the true effectiveness of the approach. The authors acknowledge this limitation, but it is a significant concern.
*   **Clarity of Uncertainty Discussion:** While the paper provides uncertainty analysis and visualizations, a more intuitive explanation of how the learned uncertainty specifically helps to improve ITM performance would be beneficial.  Specifically, how the uncertainty-aware training allows the model to better handle ambiguous examples and avoid being misled by false negatives.
*   **Limited Discussion of Failure Cases:** The paper does not discuss failure cases or limitations of PCME++ in detail. Addressing the failure cases helps to further the community's understanding.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand Computational Cost Analysis:** Provide a more comprehensive comparison of the computational cost of PCME++ against other state-of-the-art ITM methods, including both training and inference time, and memory usage.
*   **Address the ImageNet Prompt Filtering Experiment:** Either include a proper validation split or reframe the experiment as an exploratory study.
*   **Strengthen the Discussion of Uncertainty:** Provide a more intuitive explanation of how the learned uncertainty specifically improves ITM performance, particularly in handling ambiguous examples and mitigating the impact of false negatives.
*   **Discuss Failure Cases:** Discuss the limitations and failure cases of PCME++. This will give readers a more complete picture of the method's strengths and weaknesses.
*   **Typos and Grammatical Errors:** Proofread the paper carefully to correct any remaining typos and grammatical errors.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of image-text matching. The proposed PCME++ method is novel, well-evaluated, and shows promising results. Addressing the minor weaknesses mentioned above would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact. I recommend acceptance, conditional on addressing the points raised above.
