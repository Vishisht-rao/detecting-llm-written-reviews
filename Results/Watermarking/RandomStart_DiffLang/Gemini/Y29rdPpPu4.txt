OUTPUT:
The paper explores the topic of improving long-term forecasting in autoregressive models by introducing a simple modification to the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, which they term Mean Log Square Error (MLSE). The core idea is to apply an element-wise logarithmic operation after calculating the squared error. The authors claim that this seemingly minor change significantly enhances long-term forecast performance during the fine-tuning phase of a pretrain-finetune paradigm, acting as a plug-and-play and zero-cost improvement. The paper supports this claim with experiments on weather forecasting and time series datasets, and attempts to provide a theoretical justification based on modeling the rate of error accumulation.

**Strengths:**

*   **Simplicity and Practicality:** The proposed MLSE trick is remarkably simple to implement, requiring minimal code changes and no additional computational resources. Its plug-and-play nature makes it easily adaptable to existing autoregressive models.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The paper presents compelling experimental results across different datasets (WeatherBench and several time series datasets) and model architectures (FourCastNet, Lgnet, and others). The results consistently demonstrate the benefits of MLSE for long-term forecasting, showcasing its generalizability.
*   **Novelty:** The idea of applying a logarithmic transformation to the squared error loss for improving long-term forecasting is novel and potentially impactful.
*   **Theoretical Justification:** The paper attempts to provide a theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of MLSE by modeling the error accumulation process. The concept of an "error amplifier" is interesting and offers a different perspective on long-term prediction.
*   **Well-Organized:** The paper is generally well-organized, with a clear introduction, detailed experimental setup, and a discussion of limitations.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Theoretical Depth:** While the "error amplifier" concept is intriguing, the theoretical analysis feels somewhat phenomenological and lacks rigorous mathematical grounding. The approximations made in deriving equation (3) are not fully justified. A more in-depth analysis of the Jacobian operator and its impact on error propagation would strengthen the theoretical foundation.
*   **Clarity of Writing:** The writing can be occasionally unclear and dense, particularly in the theoretical section (Section 4). Some sentences are grammatically awkward, and the mathematical notation could be improved for better readability. For example, the notation in defining the error amplifier could be clarified.
*   **Limited Ablation Studies:** While the paper presents some ablation studies (Figure 5), further investigation into the sensitivity of MLSE to different logarithmic base, alternative loss functions (e.g., Huber loss in log-space), and different pretraining schemes would be beneficial.
*   **Applicability Concerns:** The authors acknowledge that the efficacy of MLSE depends on the temporal characteristics of the task. However, the criteria for determining whether a task is suitable for MLSE are not clearly defined. More guidance on identifying appropriate applications would be helpful. The claims made about its inapplicability to video prediction should be substantiated with experiments.
*   **Lack of comparison to other loss functions:** It would be helpful to compare the proposed loss to other common loss functions that are used for forecasting (e.g., MAE, Huber loss).

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Strengthen the theoretical analysis:** Provide a more rigorous mathematical derivation of the error amplifier and its impact on error propagation. Explore the properties of the Jacobian operator and its relationship to the model architecture.
*   **Improve the clarity of writing:** Revise the paper for clarity and conciseness, paying particular attention to the theoretical section. Use more precise language and improve the mathematical notation.
*   **Conduct more ablation studies:** Explore the sensitivity of MLSE to different hyperparameters (e.g., epsilon value, logarithmic base) and alternative loss functions.
*   **Provide clearer guidance on applicability:** Define the criteria for determining whether a task is suitable for MLSE. Provide examples of tasks where MLSE is expected to be effective or ineffective.
*   **Address the limitations more thoroughly:** Provide more detailed explanations for the limitations of MLSE. Discuss potential solutions or directions for future research.

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper presents a promising and practical technique for improving long-term forecasting in autoregressive models. The proposed MLSE trick is simple, effective, and supported by strong empirical evidence. While the theoretical justification could be strengthened, the paper offers a novel perspective on error accumulation and opens up new avenues for research in long-term prediction. Despite its weaknesses, the paper is a valuable contribution to the field and warrants consideration for acceptance. I would recommend acceptance conditional on addressing the clarity of writing and theoretical depth of the paper.
