**Review of "Language Model Detectors Are Easily Optimized Against"**

**Summary:**

This paper presents a compelling and concerning empirical study demonstrating the vulnerability of current language model (LLM) detectors to adversarial attacks. The authors show that it's surprisingly easy and computationally inexpensive to fine-tune language models using reinforcement learning (specifically, Direct Preference Optimization or DPO) to evade both open-source and commercial detectors. The core idea is to use the "humanness" score provided by a detector as a reward function, guiding the fine-tuning process to generate less detectable text. The results indicate that fine-tuned models can achieve AUROC scores close to or even below 0.5 (worse than random chance) against various detectors, often with only a small increase in perplexity.  Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that evasion strategies learned against one detector can generalize to other detectors, highlighting a fundamental weakness in the current detection paradigm.

**Strengths:**

*   **Relevance and Timeliness:** The paper addresses a very relevant and pressing issue.  The widespread use of LLMs and the reliance on detectors to mitigate potential misuse make this research highly important.
*   **Clear Problem Definition:** The problem is clearly articulated, and the motivation is well-established. The authors effectively highlight the limitations of existing detection methods and the potential risks of over-reliance on them.
*   **Simple yet Effective Approach:** The use of DPO for adversarial fine-tuning is clever and practical.  It provides a relatively straightforward and data-efficient way to optimize LLMs for detector evasion.
*   **Strong Empirical Evaluation:** The paper includes a thorough and comprehensive set of experiments. The authors evaluate against a diverse range of both open-source and commercial detectors, providing a realistic assessment of detector robustness. The ablation studies examining the impact of dataset size, KL divergence, and model scale are valuable.
*   **Generalization Results:** The finding that evasion strategies generalize across different detectors is significant and concerning. It suggests that the underlying features used by many detectors are vulnerable to exploitation.
*   **Practical Implications:** The paper clearly outlines the practical implications of their findings, advising against continued reliance on current LLM detectors. The ethics statement is appropriate, and the reproducibility statement is well-detailed and reassuring.
*   **Code and Data Release:** The commitment to release models, datasets, and code is commendable and will significantly benefit the research community.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Exploration of Defense Strategies:** While the paper focuses on the attack side, it could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of potential defense strategies and their limitations (Appendix C touches on this but could be expanded). Exploring possible adversarial training techniques for detectors or other mitigation strategies would strengthen the work. While countermeasures are discussed in Appendix C, each proposed countermeasure is followed by discussion of significant downsides; a more thorough exploration of these downsides may be necessary
*   **Text Quality Metric:** Perplexity, offline entropy and GPT-4 win rate, while useful, don't fully capture the nuances of text quality from a human perspective. The human evaluation (Appendix D) addresses this but could be more extensive, exploring aspects like coherence, factual accuracy, and creativity. A more sophisticated human evaluation or the use of other automated metrics like those based on semantic similarity could provide a more complete picture. While a GPT-4 metric is included, this metric should not be viewed as “truth” due to its known biases and limitations.
*   **Domain Specificity:** The experiments in essay generation (Section 4.4) and creative writing (Section 4.5) are valuable, but more exploration of other domains (e.g., code generation, legal writing) would further strengthen the generalizability of the findings.
*   **Overselling the Negative Result:** While the results are concerning, the paper might be slightly too strong in its conclusion that robust machine-generated text detection is "unsolvable." While the current generation is easily defeated, future research might lead to more resilient detection methods. It would be more balanced to acknowledge this possibility.

**Le papier résout un problème critique:**

The paper directly addresses the critical problem of the vulnerability of LLM detectors.  Given the increasing reliance on these detectors in education, journalism, and other domains, demonstrating their weakness is crucial for informing responsible AI practices and policy. The ease with which the authors can defeat existing detectors highlights a fundamental flaw in the current approach to detecting machine-generated text.

**Overall:**

This is a strong and important paper that makes a significant contribution to the field. The authors present a clear and convincing demonstration of the vulnerability of current LLM detectors to adversarial attacks. The findings have important implications for anyone relying on these detectors, and the paper should serve as a call to action for developing more robust and reliable detection methods or, perhaps more realistically, developing new standards and expectations that account for the pervasiveness of LLM-generated text. The planned release of code and data will be invaluable to the research community. Despite the minor weaknesses, this paper is well-deserving of acceptance at ICLR 2024.
