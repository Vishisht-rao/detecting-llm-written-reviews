OUTPUT:
The research focuses on a critical aspect of deep learning: the interplay between task structure, nonlinearity, and learned representations. This paper, submitted to ICLR 2024, presents a compelling analysis of how activation functions in single-hidden-layer networks influence the geometry of learned representations. The key finding is that Tanh networks tend to learn representations that reflect the structure of the target outputs, while ReLU networks retain more information about the structure of the raw inputs. This difference is consistently observed across a broad class of parameterized tasks, and the authors provide insights into the underlying learning dynamics in weight space.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear and well-defined problem:** The paper addresses a fundamental question in representation learning: how do different factors shape the geometry of learned representations? The problem is clearly articulated and motivated.
*   **Comprehensive experimental design:** The use of a parameterized family of classification tasks allows for a systematic investigation of the impact of input geometry, label geometry, and nonlinearity. The experiments are well-controlled and the results are presented clearly.
*   **Insightful analysis of learning dynamics:** The analysis of learning dynamics in weight space provides a valuable understanding of the mechanisms underlying the observed differences between Tanh and ReLU networks. The visualization of gradients and weight trajectories is particularly helpful.
*   **Strong connection to related work:** The paper appropriately situates the work within the context of existing literature, particularly on neural collapse and the impact of activation functions on network training dynamics.
*   **Generalization to more complex tasks:** The extension of the analysis to more complex tasks, including multi-layer networks and convolutional networks, strengthens the impact and relevance of the findings.
*   **Ablation studies to identify key factors:** The experiments that specifically isolate the role of the activation function's asymmetry (symmetric saturation vs linearity at origin) provide strong evidence for the proposed mechanisms.
*   **Well-written and organized:** The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear structure and logical flow.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited scale of the convolutional network experiments:** While the convolutional network experiments are a valuable addition, the scale of the experiments (specifically the number of epochs) may not be sufficient to fully capture the long-term behavior of these networks. It would be beneficial to see results over longer training periods.
*   **Simplifying assumptions in learning dynamics analysis:** The simplifying assumptions made in the analysis of learning dynamics, such as fixing the output weights, could potentially limit the generality of the findings. While the authors argue that the qualitative effects are robust to these choices (and provide some evidence in the appendix), it would be good to see a more robust argument.
*   **Lack of theoretical justification:** While the paper provides a compelling empirical analysis and insightful explanations of the observed phenomena, it lacks a formal theoretical justification for the observed differences between Tanh and ReLU networks. A theoretical framework could further strengthen the findings.
*   **The input noise experiment result in relu networks needs more explaination:** The paper mentions an increase in target alignment and decrease in input alignment for modest values of input noise in ReLU networks, and the paper does not offer detailed analysis, which requires future study.

**Suggestions for improvement:**

*   **Conduct more extensive convolutional network experiments:** Run the convolutional network experiments for a longer period of time and explore different architectures and datasets.
*   **Provide a more detailed justification for the simplifying assumptions in the learning dynamics analysis:** Offer a more rigorous argument for why the simplifying assumptions do not significantly impact the generality of the findings. Consider showing the dynamics with trained readouts.
*   **Develop a theoretical framework:** Explore the possibility of developing a theoretical framework to explain the observed differences between Tanh and ReLU networks. This could involve analyzing the gradient flow or the optimization landscape for different activation functions.
*   **Investigate the impact of different initialization schemes:** Explore the impact of different initialization schemes on the learned representations. This could help to further disentangle the effects of initialization and nonlinearity.
*   **Clearly state the limitations:** The paper should acknowledge the limitations of the study, such as the specific range of tasks considered and the simplifying assumptions made in the analysis.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the understanding of representation learning in neural networks. The findings are well-supported by empirical evidence, and the analysis is insightful and well-presented. Despite some minor weaknesses, the paper is a valuable addition to the literature and would be a welcome contribution to ICLR 2024.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend accepting this paper for publication at ICLR 2024, pending consideration of the suggestions for improvement outlined above.
