**Review of "RETHINKING THE SOLUTION TO CURSE OF DIMENSIONALITY ON RANDOMIZED SMOOTHING"**

This study examines the key subject of certified adversarial robustness for randomized smoothing (RS), specifically addressing the curse of dimensionality. The paper proposes using Exponential General Gaussian (EGG) distributions within the Double Sampling Randomized Smoothing (DSRS) framework to improve certified robustness, offering both theoretical analysis and experimental validation.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addressing an Important Problem:** The curse of dimensionality is a well-known limitation of RS, and this paper directly tackles it, which is highly relevant to the robustness research community.
*   **Solid Theoretical Foundation:** The paper provides a theoretical analysis demonstrating that specific EGG distributions can lead to tighter lower bounds for the certified radius compared to the General Gaussian distribution used in the SOTA DSRS method. The theorems (especially Theorem 1 and Theorem 4) are significant contributions.
*   **Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation:** The paper includes experiments on real-world datasets (CIFAR-10 and ImageNet) to evaluate the performance of EGG distributions, comparing them to the baseline DSRS method. The results show promising improvements in certified accuracy.
*   **Interesting Findings and Insights:** The paper's observation of a seemingly contradictory phenomenon – better theoretical lower bounds with smaller *η* but better experimental results with larger *η* – is intriguing. The paper provides a reasonable explanation based on the concentration assumption and its impact.
*   **Well Organized:** The paper follows a logical structure, starting with an introduction to the problem, related work, preliminaries, the proposed method, experiments, and a conclusion. This makes it relatively easy to follow the paper's argument.
*   **Detailed Appendix:** The paper has extensive appendices that thoroughly describe distributions, computational methods, and supplementary results, lending confidence to the paper's claims.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Strong Concentration Assumption:** The theoretical analysis relies heavily on a "concentration assumption" (Definition 2). The paper acknowledges that this assumption might be strong for real-world settings, which potentially limits the practical applicability of the theoretical results. While the discussion on when the assumption holds is present, it could be strengthened with more concrete examples or a way to measure or predict when a given base classifier satisfies it.
*   **Limited Practical Impact of DSRS Framework:** It is mentioned in the paper that DSRS has difficulties outperforming the simple NP method. It would be helpful to add a more thorough discussion that the benefits of DSRS are realized only when the concentration assumptions hold or there is a means to enhance model training and designs to leverage the theoretical results
*   **Clarity in the Contradictory Findings:** While the paper attempts to reconcile the difference between theoretical and experimental results, this section needs further clarification. Providing a visualization or a more intuitive explanation would significantly enhance understanding. Figure 1 is a start, but it can be more detailed.
*   **Limited Scope of Experiments:** The experiments mainly focus on comparing different EGG distributions within the DSRS framework. It would be valuable to include comparisons with other state-of-the-art certified defense methods beyond the baseline NP method.
*   **Some minor presentation issues**. Some of the English is awkward.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Strengthen the Discussion on the Concentration Assumption:**
    *   Provide a more thorough discussion of the limitations of the concentration assumption.
    *   Explore ways to relax the concentration assumption while still maintaining some theoretical guarantees.
    *   Consider strategies for training base classifiers that better satisfy the concentration assumption.
*   **Improve Clarity in Reconciling Theoretical and Experimental Results:**
    *   Provide a more intuitive explanation of why larger *η* values perform better in real-world settings despite the theoretical predictions.
    *   Perhaps include additional experiments or analysis to further support the explanation.
*   **Expand Experimental Evaluation:**
    *   Include comparisons with other state-of-the-art certified defense methods (e.g., adversarial training, other smoothing techniques).
    *   Conduct experiments on larger and more diverse datasets.
*   **Minor grammatical fixes:** Consider carefully proofreading and editing the paper to correct any grammatical errors or awkward phrasings, in particular there are some subject-verb agreements that need fixing.
*   **Simplify some notation.** Some of the notation can be a bit heavy, and the paper may be easier to follow with some simplifications where feasible.
*   **Address the Ethical Implications:** While this is not a major issue, briefly discussing potential ethical implications (e.g., the potential for misuse of robust models) could be beneficial.

**Overall:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of certified adversarial robustness by exploring the use of EGG distributions within the DSRS framework. The theoretical analysis and experimental results are promising, although the limitations of the concentration assumption need to be carefully considered. By addressing the weaknesses and incorporating the suggestions for improvement, the paper could be significantly strengthened and have a greater impact on the research community. The current form is a borderline accept but with some significant improvements it should be considered a strong accept.
