OUTPUT:
The paper focuses on an important area: object detection on resource-constrained IoT devices, which is a significant challenge for deploying smart surveillance systems. The proposed pipeline-based approach, aiming to improve both execution time and accuracy, is a relevant contribution. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the proposed methodology. The real-world testing in collaboration with the São Paulo Police Department strengthens the paper's practical relevance.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

**Strengths:**

*   **Relevance:** The paper addresses a critical challenge in the field of IoT and edge computing, particularly in the context of smart surveillance. Object detection with limited resources is a practical and pressing problem.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is well-written and organized. The problem is clearly defined, the proposed solution is explained in a step-by-step manner, and the experimental setup and results are presented logically.
*   **Novelty (Potential):** The claim of a unique pipeline approach specifically designed for multi-class object detection on resource-constrained devices without GPUs or cloud assistance is a potentially novel contribution. The paper distinguishes itself from existing work by highlighting this specific focus.
*   **Practical Evaluation:** The real-world testing (TRL 6) conducted in collaboration with the São Paulo Police Department significantly strengthens the paper's credibility and demonstrates the practical applicability of the proposed system.
*   **Good overview of related works:** The related works section provides a concise overview of existing IoT smart video-surveillance systems with insightful observations.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Lack of Specificity Regarding the Pipeline:** While the paper introduces the concept of a pipeline, it lacks detailed information on *how* the pipeline is specifically optimized. Describing specific optimizations for each pipeline stage would be beneficial. More details on the voting algorithm will also strengthen the paper.
*   **Dataset Details:** While the authors mention creating their dataset, more information about its composition (e.g., number of images per class, variations in lighting conditions, object sizes, and camera angles) would be beneficial. Publicly available datasets, if used, should be cited.
*   **Limited Quantitative Results:** While the paper mentions a factor of 3 improvement in execution time and a significant improvement in mAP, it doesn't provide specific quantitative values for these metrics before and after implementing the pipeline. Providing concrete numbers would allow for a more objective assessment of the proposed approach.
*   **Hardware Details:** Provide the hardware configuration on which the CNNs were trained on.
*   **Hyperparameter settings:** Provide hyperparameter settings for the training phase of YOLO models.
*   **Limited Comparison to Baselines:** The paper claims improvement over existing methods, but it lacks a direct comparison to baseline object detection methods on the same hardware and dataset. A comparative evaluation would strengthen the claims of improvement.
*   **Reproducibility:** The paper lacks sufficient detail to ensure reproducibility. Providing code, dataset details, and specific experimental configurations would be beneficial for other researchers in the field.
*   **Limited Discussion of Failure Cases:** While the paper mentions character recognition issues with license plates and their subsequent fix, it would be beneficial to discuss other potential failure cases of the system and limitations of the approach.
*   **Figure Quality:** Figure 1 could be improved for better readability.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Provide More Pipeline Details:** Elaborate on the specific techniques used to optimize each step of the pipeline. Explain the criteria for selecting the optimal image resolutions for each stage. Give more details on the 'voting algorithm'.
*   **Include Quantitative Results:** Include specific values for execution time, mAP, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics before and after implementing the pipeline.
*   **Compare to Baselines:** Compare the proposed approach to existing object detection methods (e.g., other YOLO variants, MobileNet SSD) on the same hardware and dataset.
*   **Add Dataset Details:** Provide more details about the dataset used for training, including the number of images per class, variations in lighting conditions, object sizes, and camera angles.
*   **Discuss Limitations and Failure Cases:** Discuss the limitations of the proposed approach and potential failure cases of the system.
*   **Improve Reproducibility:** Consider providing code, dataset details, and specific experimental configurations to ensure reproducibility.
*   **Proofread Carefully:** The paper has some minor formatting and grammatical errors. Careful proofreading is recommended.

**Overall Assessment:**

The paper presents a potentially valuable contribution to the field of object detection on resource-constrained IoT devices. The proposed pipeline-based approach and the real-world testing are promising. However, the paper could be significantly strengthened by providing more specific details about the pipeline optimization techniques, quantitative results, a comparison to baselines, and a more detailed discussion of limitations and failure cases. Addressing these weaknesses would enhance the paper's impact and credibility.
