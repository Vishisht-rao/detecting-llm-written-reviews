OUTPUT:
This study focuses on improving Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by addressing the question of whether the standard minimax optimization actually leads the generator's distribution to be close to the target distribution. The authors connect GAN formulations with sliced optimal transport and derive "metrizable conditions" for the discriminator to act as a distance between distributions. They then propose a novel GAN training scheme called the Slicing Adversarial Network (SAN), which modifies existing GANs to enforce these conditions. Experimental results on synthetic and image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SAN, achieving state-of-the-art FID scores on CIFAR10 and ImageNet 256x256 for class-conditional generation with StyleGAN-XL.

**Strengths:**

*   **Strong Theoretical Motivation:** The paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for SAN, linking GAN optimization to optimal transport and metrizability. The derivation of "metrizable conditions" (direction optimality, separability, and injectivity) offers valuable insights into the behavior of GANs. The formal definitions of Functional Mean Divergence (FM) and Functional Mean Divergence\* (FM\*) and their connection to Wasserstein GAN objectives are mathematically sound.
*   **Novelty:** The SAN training scheme is a novel approach to GAN training, directly targeting the problem of ensuring the discriminator provides meaningful gradients for the generator. The modifications are simple to implement and applicable to a wide range of existing GAN architectures.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The experimental results are compelling, demonstrating the effectiveness of SAN on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The improvements in FID score, especially when applied to StyleGAN-XL, are significant. The comparative studies between SAN and regular GANs using various objectives (Hinge, Saturating, Non-saturating) provide convincing evidence for the practical benefits of the approach. The exploration of different settings, including conditional/unconditional generation and fine-tuning scenarios, add further strength to the results.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, with a clear introduction, problem formulation, and presentation of theoretical results. The use of figures and tables effectively illustrates the concepts and experimental findings. The reproducibility statement and availability of code are commendable.
*   **In-Depth Analysis:** The paper does not only propose a new method, but also offers an in-depth analysis of the three proposed sufficient conditions for a discriminator to be metrizable (direction optimality, separability and injectivity).

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Theoretical limitations of separability:** A more thorough theoretical investigation on the separability of the discriminator might give more solid validation to the proposed method.
*   **Limited applicability of SAN:** The inapplicability to specific GANs (e.g., least-squares GAN) in a straightforward way somewhat limits the generalizability.
*   **Computational cost:** Although the modifications are simple, there may be some overhead with normalization of the weights. An abalation study about the computational cost might be helpful.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Separability Discussion:** Provide more discussion about the separability condition, possibly with additional theoretical analysis or examples that explain when and why it holds (or doesn't). While empirical evidence is provided, a deeper theoretical understanding would strengthen the paper.
*   **Discussion on alternative injectivity methods:** Providing discussion on the pros and cons of each kind of the injectivity-inducing methods (invertible layer, regularisation, activation removal, etc) may benefit the understanding of the GAN training.
*   **Applicability Clarification:** Clarify the limitations of SAN more explicitly. It might be helpful to specify the criteria for determining whether a GAN objective can be adapted to SAN. Also, a section could be added to discuss different ways of constructing new SAN objectives by incorporating different GAN variants for JGAN and VGAN.
*   **Computational cost comparison:** An ablation study about the comparison on the computational cost might be helpful.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the understanding and improvement of GANs. The theoretical insights are valuable, the proposed SAN training scheme is novel and effective, and the experimental results are convincing. Despite some minor weaknesses, the paper is well-written, well-organized, and provides a solid foundation for future research in this area. The paper is suitable for publication at ICLR.
