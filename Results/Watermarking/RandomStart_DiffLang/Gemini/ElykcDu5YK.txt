OUTPUT:
This manuscript examines a critical problem: the vulnerability of GAN-based image-to-image (I2I) translation models to noise. The paper proposes a theoretically grounded approach of injecting Gaussian noise during training to enhance noise robustness. The core idea is that training with Gaussian noise forces the model to align probability distributions even in the presence of noisy inputs, leading to more robust I2I translation. The paper presents a theoretical framework connecting f-divergence and score matching, analyzes the impact of Gaussian noise injection on aligning probability distributions, and explores the optimal noise intensity selection. The experimental results validate the theoretical findings, demonstrating improvements in noisy I2I translation tasks.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addressing a Significant Problem:** The paper tackles a crucial limitation of GAN-based I2I translation models in real-world scenarios where noise and distortion are prevalent.
*   **Strong Theoretical Foundation:** The paper provides a robust theoretical framework using f-divergence and score matching to explain the benefits of Gaussian noise injection. The connection between f-divergence and score matching is novel and provides valuable insights. The theorems and lemmas are well-defined and provide a solid theoretical basis for the proposed approach.
*   **Comprehensive Analysis:** The paper addresses key questions related to the impact of noise variance, resilience to unseen noise types, and optimal noise intensity selection, providing a comprehensive analysis of the approach.
*   **Extensive Experimental Validation:** The paper presents extensive experimental results on various I2I translation models and datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in noisy settings. The ablation study of training noise intensity is insightful.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, with a clear introduction, related work section, theoretical analysis, experimental results, and conclusion.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Novelty in Technique:** While the theoretical analysis is novel, the technique of injecting Gaussian noise during training is not entirely new. The paper acknowledges related work that empirically explores noise injection but argues for a lack of theoretical analysis, which this paper aims to address. However, it would be beneficial to clearly differentiate the contributions of this paper from existing empirical work more explicitly.
*   **Gaussian Assumption Limitations:** The theoretical analysis relies heavily on the Gaussian assumption for the source signal. While the paper demonstrates empirical results on non-Gaussian images, the theoretical guarantees are less clear in these cases. Exploring alternative theoretical frameworks or providing more in-depth analysis for non-Gaussian signals would strengthen the paper. The paper acknowledges in the appendix that experiments sometimes deviate from theoretical KL-divergence predictions due to the non-Gaussian nature of images and clipping during testing.
*   **CycleGAN Failure & Limitation Discussion:** The failure case with CycleGAN highlights the limitations of the method. While the paper briefly discusses this, a more thorough investigation into why GNI fails in bidirectional I2I models and potential solutions would be valuable. The paper acknowledges the "plug-and-play" limitations, but more discussion on adapting the technique for different architectures would be helpful.
*   **Clarity in Notations & Definitions:** Although the notations section is helpful, some mathematical derivations could benefit from more detailed explanations and intermediate steps for better readability, especially for readers not deeply familiar with information theory.
*   **Parameter Sensitivity:** While the paper explores the optimal noise variance, a more detailed analysis of the sensitivity of the results to different noise levels and other hyperparameters would be beneficial. The discussion surrounding the choice of σ^2_t = 0.04 is good, but deeper investigation into the performance landscape would be valuable.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Clarify Novelty:** Explicitly highlight the novel contributions of this paper compared to existing empirical studies on noise injection. Focus on the theoretical insights and the analysis of optimal noise intensity.
*   **Address Gaussian Assumption:** Discuss the limitations of the Gaussian assumption in more detail and explore alternative theoretical frameworks or analysis for non-Gaussian signals. Perhaps include a discussion of how real images deviate from a pure Gaussian model and the impact of this on the theory.
*   **Investigate CycleGAN Failure:** Provide a more in-depth investigation into why the GNI method fails in bidirectional I2I models like CycleGAN. Explore potential solutions or adaptations to the network architecture and/or loss functions. Perhaps discuss potential negative interactions with the Cycle Consistency loss.
*   **Improve Mathematical Clarity:** Provide more detailed explanations and intermediate steps in the mathematical derivations.
*   **Enhance Parameter Sensitivity Analysis:** Conduct a more comprehensive analysis of the sensitivity of the results to different noise levels and other hyperparameters.
*   **Broader Ablation Studies:** Conducting ablation studies on different components of the model and the loss function could provide valuable insights into the contribution of each part to the overall performance.
*   **Computational Cost comparison:** Compare the computation cost after using GNI. This can justify the benefit that GNI can improve the performance of I2I translation models while keeping the same computational cost.
*   **Impact of sigma_t on the network architecture:** Discuss the dependency between sigma_t and the network architecture. Is there a specific guideline to choosing a good sigma_t when the network architecture changes?

**Overall:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of I2I translation by providing a theoretical framework for understanding the benefits of Gaussian noise injection for enhancing noise robustness. The experimental results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in various I2I translation tasks. Addressing the weaknesses and suggestions mentioned above would further strengthen the paper and make it a more significant contribution to the ICLR community. The theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments warrant acceptance with revisions.
