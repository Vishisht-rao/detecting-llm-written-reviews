OUTPUT:
This study explores the context of open-ended learning in AI and proposes a novel approach called OMNI (Open-endedness via Models of human Notions of Interestingness). The core idea is to leverage foundation models (FMs), pre-trained on vast amounts of human-generated data, as models of interestingness (MoI) to guide the exploration of tasks in open-ended environments. OMNI aims to address the key challenge in open-ended learning: the difficulty of quantifying and prioritizing tasks that are not just learnable but also inherently interesting. By integrating FM-based MoIs with learning progress curricula, the authors demonstrate improved performance in three diverse and challenging domains: Crafter, BabyAI, and AI2-THOR.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The central idea of using FMs as a proxy for human notions of interestingness is innovative and potentially very impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in open-ended learning, offering a practical solution to the problem of infinite task spaces.
*   **Solid Experimental Validation:** The paper presents a thorough experimental evaluation across three different domains. This demonstrates the generalizability and robustness of the OMNI approach.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The problem is clearly articulated, the proposed solution is well-explained, and the experimental results are presented in a clear and concise manner.
*   **Strong Results:** The experimental results convincingly demonstrate that OMNI outperforms baselines based on uniform task sampling and learning progress alone. The inclusion of the "Oracle MoI" provides a valuable upper bound and highlights the effectiveness of the FM-based MoI.
*   **Handles Infinite Task Spaces:** The AI2-THOR experiment (Section 5) is significant as it tackles the challenge of infinite task spaces by using the FM to generate both new tasks and the code for the associated reward function.
*   **Addresses a Significant Problem:** The paper directly addresses the "Achilles Heel" of open-endedness research – the subjectivity and difficulty of defining "interestingness".
*   **Acknowledges Limitations and Goodhart's Law:** The authors explicitly acknowledge the limitations of the approach, particularly the potential for pathologies due to Goodhart's law, and propose avenues for future work, such as incorporating human feedback (OEHF).
*   **Comprehensive Appendices:** The detailed appendices provide ample information regarding prompts used, experimental setups and implementation specifics, facilitating reproducibility and further experimentation.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Dependency on FM Performance:** The performance of OMNI is inherently limited by the capabilities of the underlying foundation model. If the FM's understanding of interestingness is flawed or biased, this will directly affect the performance of OMNI. This is somewhat mitigated by the experimentation that prompts are a factor (i.e. OMNI : LP + MOI vs OMNI : LP + MOI - updated)
*   **Computational Cost:** Using FMs as MoIs can be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large task spaces and frequent evaluations. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the computational costs associated with OMNI.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** The effectiveness of OMNI is sensitive to the design of the prompts used to interact with the foundation model. While the authors provide detailed examples of the prompts they used, the process of designing effective prompts is still more of an art than a science. The prompt engineering techniques can be described more thoroughly.
*   **Limited Exploration of Alternative MoI Implementations:** While the paper presents a compelling case for using FMs as MoIs, it would be valuable to explore alternative implementations of MoIs, such as those based on intrinsic motivation or novelty search (although these are well-discussed as failures in the intro and related works). The EMoI attempted touches upon this but perhaps can elaborate more.
*   **Scalability concerns in Infinite Task Space:** The paper proposes the combination of learning progress with FMs to propose new tasks, and implement those tasks within an AI environment for the AI agent. Does the task space grow without bound (i.e. potentially introducing a memory bottleneck), or does the task space stabilize around a smaller subset of interesting task to learn from? What is the asymptotic time complexity of this growth?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Discuss the prompt design process more explicitly.** What principles guided the development of the prompts? What alternatives were considered and why were they rejected?
*   **Quantify the computational cost of OMNI more precisely.** How does the computational cost scale with the size of the task space and the frequency of evaluations?
*   **Address the limitations of FM dependency more thoroughly.** What are the potential biases or flaws in FMs that could negatively affect the performance of OMNI? How can these limitations be mitigated? Address and investigate more fully "what about the cases where FMs are bad models of what is interesting"?
*   **Elaborate on the connections between OEHF and RLHF.** How can techniques from RLHF be adapted to OEHF to improve the quality of the MoI? What are the key differences between these two approaches?
*   **Discuss ethical considerations.** What are the ethical implications of using FMs to guide the development of AI agents? How can OMNI be used responsibly to ensure that AI agents are aligned with human values?
*   **Add a section describing the limitations of the FM in its current state** Elaborate what the FMs can and cannot do today. What "hallucinations" do they commonly see? (i.e. if the agent can do a task, will the FM hallucinate and say the agent cannot do it? In what ways will FMs not produce desired outcomes?).

**Overall Assessment:**

This is a high-quality paper that presents a novel and promising approach to open-ended learning. The experimental results are compelling, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow. The OMNI framework has the potential to significantly advance the ability of AI to learn continuously and discover new and interesting behaviors. The weaknesses mentioned above are relatively minor and do not detract significantly from the overall value of the paper. This paper is a strong candidate for acceptance.
