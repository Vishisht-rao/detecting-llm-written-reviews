**Overall Assessment:**

This paper presents a novel and promising approach to whole-song symbolic music generation using a cascaded diffusion model and a hierarchical music language. The work addresses a significant challenge in the field – generating complete, well-structured musical pieces – and proposes a compelling solution that leverages musical theory and recent advances in deep learning.  The authors present a well-defined methodology, thorough experimental results, and compelling demonstrations of controllability. The approach shows significant promise for improving the quality and structure of generated music, and enabling more interpretable and controllable generation processes. The research addresses a critical area of focus for researchers.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The use of a cascaded diffusion model combined with a hierarchical music language for whole-song generation is a significant contribution. The concept of breaking down music generation into levels of abstraction mirroring compositional hierarchy is innovative and insightful. This is one of the few papers attempting to address the challenge of whole-song structure generation in a well-defined and experimentally driven manner.
*   **Well-Defined Methodology:** The paper clearly explains the four-level hierarchical music language, the cascaded diffusion model architecture, and the data representation scheme. The inclusion of details on training and inference algorithms enhances reproducibility. The modular design is a key strength, allowing for more targeted control and potentially easier adaptation to different musical styles.
*   **Hierarchical Music Language Design:** The hierarchical language, especially the unique design of the "Reduced Lead Sheet," shows a deep understanding of music composition. Defining explicit levels of abstraction focusing on different musical elements provides structural inductive bias, leading to training efficiency and interpretability.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The paper includes both objective and subjective evaluations to assess the model's performance. The introduction of the Inter-Phrase Latent Similarity (ILS) metric is a valuable contribution for objectively evaluating musical structure. The subjective evaluations, encompassing both short-term quality and long-term coherence, provide valuable insights into the model's perceived quality. The comparisons to strong baselines further highlight the advantages of the proposed method.
*   **Controllability:** The demonstration of flexible and interpretable controls, both via the hierarchical language and external latent representations, is a key selling point. The ability to influence the generation process through various musical features enhances the practical utility of the model.
*   **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The diagrams and tables are helpful in understanding the methodology and results. The inclusion of code and demo pages further increases the accessibility of the research.
*   **Theoretical Efficiency Analysis:** The theoretical comparison of the time and model parameter complexity between the proposed cascaded approach and a hypothetical end-to-end diffusion model provides a strong justification for the cascaded architecture. The analysis highlights the scalability advantages of the proposed approach.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Dataset Specificity:** The model is trained and evaluated primarily on the POP909 dataset, which focuses on pop music. While the focus is stated, the generalizability of the approach to other musical genres needs to be addressed. How easily could this be adapted to, say, jazz or classical music?
*   **Objective Metric Limitations:** While the ILS metric is a valuable contribution, it relies on pre-trained VAEs, which might introduce biases. Further, the metric captures similarity, but it may not fully capture higher-level structural qualities or musical expressiveness.
*   **Ending Imperfections:** The acknowledgement of flawed endings is a limitation that needs to be addressed.  This issue suggests a potential weakness in long-term dependency modeling or dataset biases in the outro sections.
*   **Limited Discussion of Failure Cases:** While the paper discusses limitations in the conclusion, more explicit analysis of specific failure cases during the experimental evaluation would further enhance the paper. What kind of structural or musical "errors" does the model commonly produce?
*   **Compute Requirements:** While the efficiency analysis is valuable, the actual compute requirements for training the model, especially the cascaded diffusion models, are not discussed in detail. Information on training time and hardware would add value.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Genre Generalization:** Discuss the potential challenges and adaptations needed to extend the approach to other musical genres. What modifications to the hierarchical language or model architecture might be necessary?
*   **Objective Metric Enhancement:** Explore alternative or complementary objective metrics that better capture the nuances of musical structure and expressiveness. Consider using metrics from music theory to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
*   **Ending Resolution Improvement:** Investigate potential solutions to the flawed ending issue, such as fine-tuning the model specifically on outro sections or incorporating techniques to explicitly encourage tonic resolution.
*   **Failure Case Analysis:** Include examples of typical failure cases during the experimental evaluation and discuss potential reasons for these failures.
*   **Quantization error handling** The paper notes that issues related to imprecise quantization in the POP909 dataset’s outro sections might be an issue. Perhaps an avenue for future work could be to devise a mechanism that is able to either fix existing quantization issues in datasets, or be robust to quantization errors.

**Conclusion:**

This is a strong paper that presents a significant advance in the field of music generation. The proposed cascaded diffusion model and hierarchical music language offer a promising approach to generating high-quality, well-structured whole songs with flexible controls. While there are areas for improvement, the contributions of this work are substantial, and the research has the potential to significantly impact the future of AI-driven music composition. The weaknesses are relatively minor compared to the strengths, and the paper is certainly worthy of acceptance.
