OUTPUT:
The paper resolves the problem of representation entanglement and localization in deep learning models applied to tabular data. It proposes PTARL, a prototype-based tabular representation learning framework that aims to learn disentangled representations around global data prototypes.

Here's a breakdown of the review, covering strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement:

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Definition:** The paper clearly identifies and explains the problems of representation entanglement and localization in deep tabular learning. The motivation is well-presented, supported by visualizations (Figure 1).
*   **Novelty:** The approach of applying prototype learning to tabular data is a novel direction. The introduction of the Prototype-based Projection Space (P-Space) is a key contribution.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The PTARL framework is well-defined with two stages: Prototype Generation and Representation Projection. The use of Optimal Transport for preserving data structure and the introduction of Coordinates Diversifying and Matrix Orthogonalization constraints are technically justified.
*   **Model Agnostic:** PTARL's model-agnostic nature is a significant advantage, allowing it to be integrated with various deep tabular models.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The paper presents extensive experiments on diverse tabular benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements over baseline models. The ablation studies effectively highlight the contribution of each component. The inclusion of statistical significance tests (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) strengthens the claims.
*   **Comprehensive Analysis:** The paper includes detailed analysis and visualizations, providing insights into the behavior of PTARL (Figures 3, 4, and 5). The additional experiments in the appendix are great to see.
*   **Good writing and structure:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it relatively easy to follow the proposed method and experimental results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity on Prototype Initialization:** While K-Means is used for prototype initialization, the impact of different initialization techniques could be further explored. The reasoning for choosing log(N) for the number of prototypes (K) is somewhat weak and could be better justified. Exploring how performance varies with different values of K is important.
*   **Computational Complexity of OT:** While the authors address the computational complexity of Optimal Transport (OT), providing a more detailed analysis, including a breakdown of the computational cost associated with each component of PTARL, would be beneficial. Table 6 is a good start, but needs to discuss the numbers a bit more in the main text.
*   **Parameter Sensitivity:** The sensitivity analysis for the loss weights is good, but a broader analysis of the sensitivity of PTARL to other hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate of the estimator ϕ) would further strengthen the paper.
*   **Generalization across different tabular datasets:** While the paper experiments with a good variety of datasets, some further discussion of limitations and dataset characteristics that might make PTARL more or less effective would add useful context. Are there specific types of tabular data where PTARL might not be as effective?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Prototype Initialization Analysis:**
    *   Add a short section discussing alternative prototype initialization methods and their potential impact.
    *   Provide a more in-depth justification for using log(N) as the number of prototypes. Empirically demonstrate the effect of using different values of K.
*   **Computational Cost:**
    *   In the main text, discuss the computational overhead introduced by PTARL, referring to the numbers provided in Table 6. Discuss which parts of the framework contribute the most to the computational cost.
    *   Consider adding a discussion about strategies for reducing the computational cost of PTARL (e.g., approximate OT computation).
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:**
    *   Expand the sensitivity analysis to include other key hyperparameters.
*   **Dataset Specific Considerations:**
    *   Add a section discussing the potential limitations of PTARL and the types of tabular datasets where it might not be as effective.
*   **Minor suggestions:**
    *   Throughout the paper, be consistent with terminology ("PT ARL" vs. "PTARL").
    *   In the conclusion, explicitly state the limitations and future directions of the research.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that addresses an important problem in deep tabular learning. The proposed PTARL framework is novel, technically sound, and empirically validated. Addressing the weaknesses and incorporating the suggestions for improvement would further enhance the paper and make it a valuable contribution to the field.
