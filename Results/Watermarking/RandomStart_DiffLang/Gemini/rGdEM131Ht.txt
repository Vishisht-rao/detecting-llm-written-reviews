OUTPUT:
Le papier aborde l'aspect clé of generative time series learning, specifically focusing on long-term probabilistic forecasting and imputation, which are often overlooked in favor of deterministic point forecasts. The proposed Time-Frequency fused Energy-Based Model (TF-EBM) is a novel approach that leverages the power of energy-based models and time-frequency analysis to address the challenges of long-term time series forecasting.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The paper introduces a genuinely novel approach, TF-EBM, for generative time series forecasting. The fusion of energy-based models with time-frequency analysis is a promising direction. The idea of learning the distribution of the entire temporal path, rather than step-by-step predictions, is compelling.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The model is well-described, and the rationale behind each component (residual dilated convolutional network, time-frequency feature extraction) is clearly explained. The use of Langevin MCMC for efficient sampling is also a good choice. The training procedure using maximum likelihood estimation with contrastive divergence is standard practice for EBMs.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper provides a thorough experimental evaluation of TF-EBM on various datasets and tasks, including probabilistic forecasting, long-term forecasting, and imputation. The comparison with a wide range of baselines is valuable. The inclusion of CRPS for probabilistic forecasting and MAE/MSE for long-term forecasting and imputation is appropriate. The transfer learning experiments add an additional layer of interest.
*   **Ablation Studies:** The ablation studies are crucial for understanding the contribution of each component of TF-EBM. The analysis of the residual dilated convolutional network on synthetic data and the time-frequency feature extraction module are particularly insightful. The experiment on long-term dependencies using varying layers is also valuable.
*   **Pre-training Strategy:** The proposed pre-training strategy, inspired by NLP, is a very interesting and potentially impactful contribution. The ability to pre-train a single model for multiple tasks (forecasting and imputation) is highly desirable.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, although some sections could be improved (see weaknesses). The figures are helpful for understanding the model architecture.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Related Works Could Be More Focused:** While the Related Works section covers EBMs, Transformers, and probabilistic models, it could benefit from a more critical analysis of the existing literature *specifically within the context of time series*. For example, are there existing EBM-based time series models that are *not* diffusion-based? A more detailed comparison highlighting the specific advantages of TF-EBM over *all* relevant prior work would be beneficial. The current comparison focuses heavily on TimeGrad and ScoreGrad.
*   **Clarity on MCMC Sampling:** The explanation of the Langevin MCMC sampling process (Section 3.2) could be more detailed. What initial distribution *specifically* is used (e.g., a Gaussian with what mean and variance)? How is the step size ε chosen? The number of MCMC steps (C) is a critical hyperparameter, and more justification for the chosen value is needed.
*   **Justification of Hyperparameters:** While the paper mentions some key hyperparameters, it lacks a thorough discussion on how these hyperparameters were selected and their impact on model performance. A sensitivity analysis for key hyperparameters (e.g., number of layers in TFB, dilation rates in dilated CNNs, MCMC step size, number of MCMC steps) would strengthen the paper. Are the parameters of the architecture dependent on the length of the series being forecasted/imputed?
*   **Statistical Significance:** While the results look promising, the paper would benefit from a discussion of the statistical significance of the improvements achieved by TF-EBM over the baselines. It is stated that a minimal amount of variance separates various time features, but this isn't quantifiable to the reader.
*   **Scalability:** The paper lacks any discussion on the scalability of TF-EBM to very long time series or high-dimensional multivariate time series. Given the use of MCMC sampling, which can be computationally expensive, this is an important consideration.
*   **Uncertainty Quantification Discussion:** It would be interesting to have a more detailed discussion on how the probabilistic nature of TF-EBM allows for uncertainty quantification and how this could be used in downstream applications. The simple synthetic data experiments do not show real-world value.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Refine Related Works:** Provide a more focused and critical analysis of existing time series models, especially those based on EBMs or time-frequency analysis.
*   **Clarify MCMC Implementation:** Provide more details on the Langevin MCMC sampling process, including the initial distribution, step size selection, and number of MCMC steps.
*   **Discuss Hyperparameter Tuning:** Discuss the hyperparameter tuning process and provide a sensitivity analysis for key hyperparameters.
*   **Address Statistical Significance:** Include a discussion of the statistical significance of the experimental results.
*   **Address Scalability:** Discuss the scalability of TF-EBM to long time series and high-dimensional multivariate time series.
*   **Expand Uncertainty Quantification:** Elaborate on the uncertainty quantification capabilities of TF-EBM and provide examples of how this could be used in practice.
*   **Minor Edit:** There are a few grammatical errors ("distastes" instead of "datasets") and formatting inconsistencies that need to be addressed.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Despite the weaknesses, the paper presents a novel and promising approach for generative time series learning. The TF-EBM model is technically sound, well-evaluated, and shows competitive results on various tasks. The pre-training strategy is a particularly interesting contribution. With some revisions to address the weaknesses outlined above, this paper would be a valuable contribution to the ICLR 2024 conference.

**Recommendation:** **Accept (with revisions)**
