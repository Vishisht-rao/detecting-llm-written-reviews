OUTPUT:
This manuscript tackles the crucial problem of training dataset selection. The authors introduce Gradient Information Optimization (GIO), a novel, scalable, and task-agnostic approach to selecting informative subsets from large training datasets. The core idea revolves around optimizing an information-theoretic objective – minimizing the KL divergence between a target distribution and the distribution represented by the selected training data.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Relevance:** Training with subsets of data is increasingly important due to resource constraints, data quality variations, and the desire for efficient training. This paper directly addresses this practical concern.
*   **Novelty and Methodology:** The authors present a theoretically sound approach based on KL divergence minimization. They then skillfully address the computational challenges associated with this objective by introducing several optimizations:
    *   Using the derivative of the KL divergence for gradient descent, significantly improving efficiency.
    *   Employing a quantization-explosion process with K-means clustering to reduce the computational burden further.
    *   Leveraging a k-Nearest Neighbors approximation for KL divergence estimation in high-dimensional spaces.
*   **Task Agnostic and Domain Agnostic:** A major strength of GIO is its broad applicability. The method doesn't require labeled data and works with continuous representations, making it suitable for diverse tasks and domains.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The paper presents comprehensive experiments on machine translation (WMT14), spelling correction, and image recognition (FashionMNIST). The results consistently demonstrate that GIO can achieve comparable or even superior performance to training on the full dataset, using significantly smaller subsets. GIO also outperformed several strong baseline data selection methods.
*   **Thorough Evaluation:** The authors not only demonstrate performance gains but also conduct analytic checks to validate the self-consistency and negative-consistency of GIO. They also address potential limitations of the approach. They conduct robustness experiments, showing GIO is resistant to changes in embedding model or number of KMeans clusters.
*   **Open-Source Implementation:** The availability of a `pip installable` package and detailed code increases the reproducibility of results.
*   **Clear Writing and Organization:** The paper is well-written and structured. The authors clearly explain the theoretical foundations, algorithmic details, and experimental setup.

**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Local Density Assumption:** The paper mentions the "local density assumption" (Appendix A.2) but might benefit from a more prominent discussion in the main text. The validity of this assumption could impact the performance of GIO in some cases. The authors could explore methods to mitigate violations of this assumption.
*   **Gradient Descent in Non-Convex Space:** The authors acknowledge that using gradient descent in a non-convex space can lead to suboptimal solutions. The paper could explore alternative optimization methods better suited for non-convex functions, as proposed in the limitations section.
*   **Guidance on Parameter Selection:** While the paper provides information on how to use the GIO class, some more direct and detailed guidance on selecting parameters (e.g., k, learning rate, stopping criteria) would be valuable, maybe with a dedicated section.
*   **Explanation of Stopping Criteria:** The stopping criteria (e.g. 'increase', 'sequential_increase_tolerance') is well described in the code, but should be well explained in the main text.
*   **Edge cases of negative transfer:** The theoretical and analytical checks were excellent and showed GIO's self-consistency and negative consistency, but some additional information and analytical checks concerning negative transfer cases when the target and source are from a close but dissimilar dataset (as is frequently the case in practice) would be helpful.

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of data selection. GIO offers a novel, scalable, and effective approach for identifying informative subsets of training data, with broad applicability across diverse tasks and domains. The strong empirical results, theoretical grounding, and publicly available code make this paper a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners alike. The suggested improvements would further strengthen the paper.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend acceptance with minor revisions addressing the suggested improvements.
