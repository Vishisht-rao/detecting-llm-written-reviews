OUTPUT:
The research examines an important problem: the potential for general knowledge transfer between any pair of pre-trained models, regardless of their architecture, performance level, or training details. This is a compelling idea with the potential to unlock significant gains in machine learning by allowing us to leverage the vast and growing collection of pre-trained models more effectively.

Here's a breakdown of the paper's strengths and weaknesses:

**Strengths:**

*   **Well-defined problem and motivation:** The paper clearly articulates the problem of limited knowledge transfer in existing methods and convincingly argues for the importance of a general solution. The authors highlight the potential benefits, including training guidance, auxiliary gains, and knowledge fusion, even from weaker models.
*   **Comprehensive empirical study:** The paper presents a thorough and extensive set of experiments. The authors use a large number of pre-trained models from public libraries and test their approaches across various architectures and performance levels. The use of a stratified ImageNet subset allows for faster iteration and exploration, while validation on the full ImageNet dataset strengthens the findings.
*   **Novel approach:** The paper proposes a novel approach based on the idea of continual learning and data partitioning. By treating the transfer process as a continual learning problem, the authors address the critical trade-off between knowledge gain and retention. The confidence-based data partitioning is a simple yet effective way to regularize the transfer process. The unsupervised variant further enhances the practicality of the proposed method.
*   **Clear exposition:** The paper is well-written and easy to follow, despite the complexity of the topic. The authors provide clear explanations of their methods and results, supported by insightful figures and tables.
*   **Strong results:** The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The authors show that their method significantly improves the success rate of knowledge transfer compared to standard knowledge distillation techniques. They also provide evidence that the gains stem from the transfer of complementary knowledge between models.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited exploration of other continual learning methods:** While the paper convincingly demonstrates the benefits of a continual learning approach, the exploration of other continual learning techniques beyond momentum weight interpolation is relatively limited. Investigating other regularization techniques or replay-based methods could provide further insights.
*   **Dependence on ImageNet-pretrained models:** The study primarily focuses on models pre-trained on ImageNet. While ImageNet is a common benchmark, it would be valuable to explore the generalizability of the proposed approach to other datasets and tasks.
*   **Limited discussion of computational cost:** While the authors mention the maintenance of original inference costs, the computational cost of the transfer process itself is not thoroughly discussed. The data partitioning approach requires additional forward passes through the teacher and student models, which could be computationally expensive for large datasets and models.
*   **The lack of direct comparison with specialized knowledge transfer approaches:** While the authors explain that their proposed method is designed for the model-agnostic scenarios, comparing with model-specific transfer methods (like attention transfer) as a baseline would better illustrate the advantage of general methods in handling a wide variety of teacher-student pairs.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Investigate other continual learning techniques:** Explore other regularization techniques (e.g., elastic weight consolidation) or replay-based methods to further improve the trade-off between knowledge gain and retention.
*   **Expand the experimental evaluation to other datasets and tasks:** Evaluate the generalizability of the proposed approach to other datasets and tasks beyond ImageNet.
*   **Provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost:** Quantify the computational cost of the transfer process and compare it to the cost of training a model from scratch.
*   **Analyze failure cases:** Provide a more in-depth analysis of the failure cases of the proposed approach. Understanding the limitations of the method would help to guide future research.
*   **Discuss the potential for negative transfer:** While the proposed approach aims to avoid performance degradation, it would be helpful to discuss the potential for negative transfer and how to mitigate it.
*   **Expand on the sequential transfer process details:** In Sequential knowledge transfer, it is not very clear if the authors have chosen specific criteria (if yes, which ones?) or some sort of iterative method to select the best subsequent teacher to use for each student.

**Overall Assessment:**

This is a strong paper that addresses an important and challenging problem. The proposed approach is novel and effective, and the experimental results are convincing. The paper is well-written and easy to follow. While there are some areas for improvement, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses. This paper is a valuable contribution to the field of machine learning and is likely to have a significant impact on future research in knowledge transfer. I recommend acceptance.
