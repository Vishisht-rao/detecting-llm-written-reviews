**Review**

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper proposes a novel multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) approach called BOTIED, which leverages tied multivariate ranks and copulas to address the challenges of scalability and sensitivity to objective transformations in high-dimensional MOBO. The paper is well-motivated, clearly written (for the most part), and presents a technically sound approach. The connection between non-dominated solutions and multivariate ranks is insightful, and the proposed CDF indicator offers a promising alternative to hypervolume (HV). The empirical results demonstrate that BOTIED performs competitively with existing MOBO methods, while also exhibiting computational efficiency and robustness. While the core idea is interesting, the paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion of limitations and a stronger justification for certain implementation choices.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The use of multivariate ranks and copulas for MOBO is a fresh perspective, particularly in addressing the curse of dimensionality associated with traditional HV-based methods. The introduction of CDF indicator is a novel approach.
*   **Motivation:** The paper clearly articulates the limitations of existing MOBO techniques (EHVI, entropy search, random scalarization) in terms of scalability, sensitivity to transformations, and computational cost.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation for BOTIED, including the definition of the CDF indicator, the proof of Pareto compliance, and the justification for using copulas.
*   **Experimental Results:** The empirical evaluation is comprehensive, covering both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that BOTIED achieves competitive performance compared to well-established baselines, with favorable computational efficiency.
*   **Clarity of Writing:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the proposed method and its advantages. The figures are helpful in illustrating the key concepts.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors have made their code and a custom dataset available, which promotes reproducibility and further research.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Novelty in Copula Usage:** While the *combination* of ranks, CDF, and copulas in MOBO is novel, copulas themselves have been used in optimization and related fields. The paper should more explicitly acknowledge and differentiate itself from these existing applications (some are in the related work, but the difference could be highlighted.)
*   **Justification for Vine Copulas:** The paper advocates for vine copulas due to their flexibility and scalability. However, it doesn't provide a strong justification for *why* vine copulas are specifically needed in the considered experimental settings. Are the dependencies between objectives truly so complex that simpler copula structures (e.g., Gaussian copulas) would be insufficient? An ablation study comparing different copula families would strengthen this argument. Also, is that copula family pre-selected or learned? If the former, this is a hyperparameter that can significantly impact performance.
*   **Discussion of Copula Model Selection:** The choice of copula family (Gaussian, KDE, etc.) and its parameters can significantly impact the performance of BOTIED. The paper mentions that the copula family is pre-selected for efficiency, but it doesn't discuss the criteria for selecting a particular family or how this selection might affect the results. How sensitive is the performance of BOTIED to the copula family selection?
*   **Limitations Section:** The paper lacks a dedicated "Limitations" section. It should explicitly address the potential weaknesses and limitations of BOTIED, such as:
    *   The computational cost of fitting vine copulas, especially in very high-dimensional objective spaces or with large datasets.
    *   The sensitivity of BOTIED to the accuracy of the probabilistic surrogate model.
    *   The potential for copula model misspecification to negatively impact performance.
    *   The lack of theoretical guarantees on the convergence of BOTIED.
*   **Choice of Baselines:** While the chosen baselines are reasonable, the inclusion of more recent MOBO algorithms or variants specifically designed for high-dimensional objective spaces would be beneficial. For example, including a method that directly optimizes the CDF indicator with a different approach (e.g. gradient based) might provide a more direct comparison.
*   **Clarity on variance handling:** The distinction between BOTIED v1 and v2 needs further clarification. Describing v2 as "mean-aggregated" is vague. Does this mean fitting the copula to the *means* of the posterior predictive distributions, or something else? The impact of handling the MC variance should be more explicitly shown.

**Specific Comments and Suggestions:**

*   **Abstract:** Consider rephrasing "BOTIED performs on par with the baselines across datasets and metrics while being computationally efficient" to be more specific and impactful. Quantify the computational efficiency gains, and highlight the scenarios where BOTIED excels.
*   **Introduction:** Provide a brief overview of copulas and their relevance to modeling dependencies in high-dimensional data.
*   **Figure 1:** Improve the clarity of Figure 1(b). Explain how the CDF scores are calculated and why they closely trace the HV.
*   **Section 3.1:** The definition of Pareto compliance could be made more accessible to readers unfamiliar with MOBO.
*   **Section 3.4:** Provide a more detailed explanation of vine copulas and their advantages over other copula structures. Include a diagram illustrating the structure of a vine copula.
*   **Algorithm 1:**
    * Line 11: The phrase "uniform marginals on the sample level" could be made clearer.
    * Add a step explicitly stating the Probability Integral Transform to ensure uniform marginals for both v1 and v2 prior to copula fitting.
*   **Experiments:** Include a table summarizing the experimental setup, including the datasets, evaluation metrics, baseline algorithms, and hyperparameter settings.
*   **Appendix D, Table 2:** Consider reformatting this table to improve readability and highlight the key differences between BOTIED and the related works.

**Minor Comments:**

*   Typos: There are a few minor typos and grammatical errors throughout the paper. Proofread carefully.
*   Citations: Ensure that all citations are in the correct format and that all references are included in the bibliography.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend this paper for acceptance, conditional on addressing the identified weaknesses. Specifically, the authors should:

*   Provide a more detailed discussion of limitations.
*   Strengthen the justification for using vine copulas.
*   Clarify the method for handling the MC variance.
*   Consider including additional baselines.
*   Address the specific comments and suggestions provided above.

Addressing these points will significantly improve the quality and impact of the paper.

**Confidence:**

I am reasonably confident in my assessment. I have experience in Bayesian optimization and related fields.
