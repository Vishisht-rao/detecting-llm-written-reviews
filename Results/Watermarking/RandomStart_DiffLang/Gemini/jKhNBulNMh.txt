Okay, here is a review of the paper "RETHINKING BRANCHING ON EXACT COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION SOLVER: THE FIRST DEEP SYMBOLIC DISCOVERY FRAMEWORK" submitted to ICLR 2024.

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper presents a novel and compelling approach to learning branching policies for combinatorial optimization (CO) solvers. The core idea of using deep symbolic discovery (Symb4CO) to generate concise, human-interpretable branching heuristics is a significant departure from existing machine learning methods that often rely on complex, black-box models like GNNs. The paper clearly articulates the limitations of existing ML approaches (high training cost, GPU dependency, lack of interpretability) and provides a strong motivation for the proposed symbolic approach.  The experimental results are promising, demonstrating competitive performance with SOTA GPU-based methods, while offering significantly improved training and inference efficiency and interpretability. The work is well-written, clearly explained, and the experiments are relatively thorough.  The idea of discovering new symbolic expressions for solver components has significant potential.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The application of deep symbolic discovery to the branching task in CO solvers is a novel and potentially impactful idea.
*   **Addressing Limitations:** The paper effectively addresses the key limitations of existing ML approaches for CO, particularly regarding deployment in CPU-based environments and the lack of interpretability.
*   **Interpretability:** The generated symbolic policies are highly interpretable, allowing researchers to understand and potentially improve upon existing human-designed heuristics.
*   **Efficiency:** The Symb4CO framework demonstrates impressive training and inference efficiency, requiring significantly fewer training instances and minimal computational resources.
*   **Experimental Validation:** The experiments are well-designed and demonstrate the effectiveness of Symb4CO across a range of benchmark problems. The comparison against strong baselines, including both human-designed and ML-based policies, strengthens the results.
*   **Well-Written and Clear:** The paper is well-structured, easy to follow, and clearly explains the methodology and results. The figures and tables are informative and effectively support the claims made in the paper.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Reliance on Full Strong Branching (FSB) for Data Collection:**  The use of FSB to generate training data, while common practice, can be a bottleneck, especially for larger or more complex CO problems.  The paper could benefit from discussing alternative data generation strategies that might reduce the reliance on FSB. This is touched upon in related work, but not expanded upon.
*   **Limited Exploration of Symbolic Expression Space:** The paper focuses on a specific set of mathematical operators and constants. While the ablation study provides some justification for this choice, it would be interesting to explore the impact of expanding the set of operators or using more sophisticated constant generation techniques. More analysis would be useful to better understand the relationship between the type of operators used and the performance of the learned policies.
*   **Generalization Beyond Training Distribution:** Although the paper shows good generalization to medium and hard instances, the training is still done on easy instances. Further analysis on how the method generalizes to unseen types of problems or instances significantly different from the training distribution would be useful. How does the method cope with domain shift, and are there mechanisms to improve robustness?
*   **Lack of Deeper Insight into Learned Policies:** While the paper highlights the interpretability of the learned policies, it provides limited in-depth analysis of the meaning or implications of the discovered expressions. A deeper discussion of the learned policies, relating them to existing domain knowledge or intuition, could further enhance the value of the paper.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address the FSB Data Generation Bottleneck:** Discuss alternative data generation strategies or techniques to reduce the reliance on FSB, such as using a weaker branching policy with some degree of exploration or active learning methods to select the most informative training instances.
*   **Further Exploration of Symbolic Expression Space:** Discuss the potential benefits and challenges of using a larger or more diverse set of mathematical operators, or using different strategies for constant generation, such as learning the constants directly.
*   **Deeper Analysis of Learned Policies:** Provide a more in-depth analysis of the learned symbolic policies, relating them to existing domain knowledge, identifying patterns or relationships, and discussing the potential implications for understanding and improving branching heuristics.
*   **Consider alternative architectures.** The paper focuses on LSTM architecture for the sequential model. Exploring other architectures, like Transformers, could be considered.

**Minor Comments:**

*   The abstract mentions "ten training instances" but later refers to "ten and four instances". Clarify.
*   Typos: There are a few minor typos throughout the text (e.g., "tentraining").
*   In table 1, it is hard to assess what "GNN-GPU" adds as a baseline. Is this the same GNN as on CPU? The naming is confusing and makes it difficult to read that row. Consider either removing this row or providing a different name for clarity.
*   Github repository link could be more explicit to which version of the code it corresponds to (e.g., include a specific tag).

**Conclusion:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and promising approach to learning branching policies for CO solvers. The Symb4CO framework offers significant advantages in terms of efficiency, interpretability, and deployment feasibility compared to existing ML-based methods. While there are some areas for improvement, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field and has the potential to inspire further research in this area. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the weaknesses and suggestions outlined above.
