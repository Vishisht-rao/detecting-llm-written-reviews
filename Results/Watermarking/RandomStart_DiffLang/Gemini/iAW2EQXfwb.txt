Okay, here is a review of the submitted conference paper.

**Overall Assessment:**

This research explores a critical aspect of online procedural content generation (PCG) using reinforcement learning (RL): the lack of diversity in generated game levels. The paper proposes a novel negatively correlated ensemble RL (NCERL) approach to address this limitation, integrating a negative correlation regularisation technique to diversify generated level segments. The paper offers theoretical contributions in the form of regularized policy iteration and policy-regularisation gradient theorems, and also presents an asynchronous off-policy training framework for improved efficiency. The experimental results on the Mario level generation benchmark demonstrate a notable boost in level diversity with competitive reward performance. The paper makes a solid contribution to the field and is well-written.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Significance:** The paper addresses a vital problem in online PCG for games. Lack of diversity leads to player boredom and reduces the value of automatically generated content. The paper convincingly argues the need for diverse online level generation.
*   **Novel Approach:** The NCERL method is a novel and well-motivated approach. The use of negatively correlated sub-policies and the Wasserstein distance-based regularisation are sound techniques to encourage diversity.
*   **Theoretical Contributions:** The derivation of the regularized policy iteration and policy-regularisation gradient theorems is a strong theoretical contribution. These theorems provide a solid foundation for optimizing policy regularisation in MDPs. This could have implications beyond just the PCG domain.
*   **Asynchronous Training Framework:** The asynchronous off-policy training framework is a practical contribution that addresses the computational challenges of reward evaluation in OLG tasks. This is a well-engineered solution and a substantial addition to the paper.
*   **Comprehensive Experiments:** The experimental setup is comprehensive, including comparisons with state-of-the-art ensemble RL methods and classic RL algorithms. The use of two different reward functions adds robustness to the evaluation. The results are presented clearly and analyzed thoughtfully.
*   **Pareto Front Analysis:** Visualising the results as a Pareto front allows for an intuitive understanding of the trade-off between diversity and reward, highlighting the flexibility of the NCERL approach.
*   **Reproducibility:** The public availability of code and results is a commendable practice that enhances the reproducibility and impact of the research.
*   **Well-written:** The paper is generally well-written and logically structured. The background and related work are thoroughly discussed. The method and experimental setup are clearly explained.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Instability of Training:** The paper acknowledges the instability of NCERL training, leading to potentially large performance variations across trials. While the authors propose future work to address this, it remains a significant limitation of the method. The high standard deviation across trials also limits the impact of the conclusions drawn from the experiments.
*   **Limited Discussion of Action Decoder Choice:** The choice of using a GAN as action decoder is mentioned, but the impact of *this specific* choice on the diversity of generated levels is not discussed. Could alternative generative models offer advantages or disadvantages? Is the latent space of the GAN limiting the diversity that can be achieved?
*   **Down-clip Parameter:** The value of the down-clip parameter (¯ω) seems arbitrarily selected. A more rigorous justification or sensitivity analysis of this parameter would strengthen the work.
*   **Minor Clarification Needed in Regularization Formulation:** The text, “ϱπ(s)is maximised only if ωi,j(s)≥¯ωandβi(s) =βj(s)for all pairs of iandj” could be clearer. Is this a design goal of the regularization, or a mathematical consequence?
*   **Minor Grammatical Points:** "multi-process framework *in* (Wang et al., 2022)" - should be 'from'.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address Training Instability:** Explore techniques to improve the stability of NCERL training. This could involve modifications to the optimization process, regularisation techniques, or network architectures. Including such an effort would be a very strong addition.
*   **GAN Decoder Discussion:** Add a discussion on the impact of the GAN-based action decoder on the diversity of generated levels. Compare alternative decoder approaches.
*   **Down-clip Parameter Analysis:** Provide a more rigorous justification for the choice of the down-clip parameter (¯ω). Consider a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of different values on the performance of NCERL.
*   **Empirical Justification for the Claim: Perfectible MDP:** While the explanation of how the low γ can be used on Mario is theoretically justified, provide some empirical justification for the "perfectible MDP" claim.
*   **Clarify "Individual Actor Selection Probability" Analysis:**  The tables on individual actor selection are a good start. However, add some more discussion of the implications of these results. The observation "This is because λ is small" is currently lacking.

**Conclusion:**

The paper presents a strong and novel approach to generating diverse game levels using reinforcement learning. The theoretical contributions, asynchronous training framework, and comprehensive experimental results contribute significantly to the field. Addressing the limitations related to training stability and providing further analysis of key parameters would further enhance the impact of this research. I recommend acceptance, conditional upon addressing the suggested improvements.
