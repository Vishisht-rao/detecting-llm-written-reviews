**This research addresses an important problem: mitigating dataset bias in diffusion models, a relatively under-explored area despite the increasing prevalence of these models and their sensitivity to biased training data.**

**Summary:**

The paper proposes a "Time-dependent Importance reWeighting" (TIW) method to train unbiased diffusion models from biased datasets. The core idea is to estimate the time-dependent density ratio between the perturbed biased and unbiased data distributions using a time-dependent discriminator. This density ratio is then used for both reweighting the loss function and correcting the score function, leading to a tractable objective that theoretically converges to an unbiased distribution.  The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, FFHQ, and CelebA) with various bias settings, showing improvements over time-independent reweighting and naive training baselines.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Significance:**  The paper tackles a crucial issue.  Dataset bias is a well-known problem in machine learning, and generative models are particularly vulnerable. Addressing this in the context of diffusion models is highly relevant.
*   **Novelty:** The proposed TIW method is novel. The idea of using a time-dependent density ratio for bias mitigation in diffusion models appears to be original.  The dual use of the density ratio for reweighting and score correction is a clever technique.
*   **Theoretical Justification:** The paper provides a theoretical connection to traditional score-matching, demonstrating the convergence of the proposed method to an unbiased distribution.  The theorem and corollary offer solid support for the approach.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The experiments are comprehensive and convincing.  The authors evaluate their method on multiple datasets with different types of biases and reference set sizes.  The ablation studies effectively demonstrate the contribution of each component of the TIW method.
*   **Clarity of Writing:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, especially considering the technical nature of the content. The figures and tables are helpful in understanding the method and results.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors provide a link to their code, increasing the reproducibility of their work.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Complexity:** While generally well-explained, the method involves several moving parts (time-dependent discriminator, score correction, reweighting). A more intuitive explanation of why *both* reweighting and score correction are necessary (beyond the theoretical proof) would be helpful.
*   **Discriminator Training:**  While the paper mentions the importance of a well-trained discriminator, it could benefit from a deeper discussion on the practical aspects of training the time-dependent discriminator.  Are there any specific challenges or best practices? The ablation study in E.5 is useful, but a more proactive discussion would be valuable.
*   **Computational Cost:** The increased computational cost compared to IW-DSM, although acceptable, is worth highlighting more prominently in the main text.
*   **Limited Data Overfitting:** The paper mentions overfitting with limited data, but a more in-depth analysis or potential solutions to mitigate this issue would further strengthen the work.
*   **Stable Diffusion Experiments:** While the experiment involving fine-tuning Stable Diffusion is interesting, it feels a bit disconnected from the core contribution of the paper. A more thorough exploration of how TIW can be applied to large-scale text-to-image models would be valuable. Perhaps explore training from scratch or using a larger reference set.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Intuitive Explanation:** Provide a more intuitive explanation of why *both* reweighting and score correction are crucial for the method to work effectively.
*   **Discriminator Training Details:** Expand on the practical considerations for training the time-dependent discriminator, including any challenges or best practices.
*   **Address Overfitting:** Discuss potential strategies to mitigate overfitting when training with very limited reference data.
*   **Broader Impact:** Discuss the broader impact of this work, including potential societal implications and ethical considerations related to bias mitigation in generative models.
*   **Connection to GANs:** Section B.4 mentions related work in GANs. Could the authors elaborate on how their time-dependent density ratio approach differs from or improves upon existing techniques used in GAN training?
*   **Clarify Scope:** In the introduction, state more precisely what kind of bias the method addresses. Is it primarily representation bias? Does it handle other forms of bias (e.g., measurement bias) as well?

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of generative modeling. The proposed TIW method is novel, theoretically sound, and empirically validated. The paper is well-written and addresses an important problem with increasing relevance.  The suggestions for improvement are primarily aimed at enhancing the clarity and completeness of the presentation.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend this paper for acceptance, with a suggestion to address the points raised in the "Suggestions for Improvement" section. The work is technically sound and addresses a crucial problem in generative modeling.
