OUTPUT:
The manuscript focuses on the question of bridging the gap between brain simulation and brain-inspired computing (BIC) by introducing BrainPy, a differentiable brain simulator built using JAX and XLA. This is a relevant and timely topic, as the two fields have traditionally been somewhat separate despite their potential for mutual benefit. The paper argues that existing software solutions in either field fall short of fully integrating the biophysical realism of brain simulation with the training capabilities of deep learning frameworks. BrainPy aims to address this limitation by providing a flexible, efficient, and scalable brain simulation platform that is also differentiable.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Problem Definition:** The paper clearly articulates the problem of disconnectedness between brain simulation and BIC, and the limitations of current tools.
*   **Novel Approach:** Introducing a differentiable brain simulator using JAX is a novel and promising approach. Leveraging the capabilities of JAX for both AI models and brain simulations is a key strength.
*   **Technical Contributions:** The paper highlights several important technical contributions of BrainPy, including:
    *   Dedicated operators for sparse and event-driven computation.
    *   JIT connectivity algorithms for scalable simulation.
    *   A modular and multi-scale model building interface.
    *   Object-oriented JIT compilation for efficiency.
*   **Demonstrations:** The paper presents several demonstrations that showcase the efficiency, scalability, and differentiability of BrainPy. The benchmarks against existing brain simulators and BIC libraries are valuable. The application to a working memory task with a biologically plausible spiking network is compelling.
*   **Well-written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it relatively easy to follow the key ideas and contributions.

**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Clarity on JAX Integration:** While the paper mentions integration with JAX-based libraries like Flax, it could benefit from more concrete examples and details on how these integrations work in practice. Providing code snippets or specific use cases would enhance clarity.
*   **Depth of Comparison:** While the comparisons to existing simulators and BIC libraries are helpful, some could be expanded. For example, a more detailed discussion of the specific limitations of existing BIC libraries in capturing biophysical realism would strengthen the argument for BrainPy. Comparing also against other differentiable simulators (if they exist) would be beneficial.
*   **Scalability Limits:** While the paper emphasizes scalability, it could be more transparent about the limitations of BrainPy in terms of the size and complexity of simulations it can handle.  What are the practical limits in terms of neuron count, synaptic connections, and simulation time for different hardware configurations?
*   **Benchmarking Clarity:** The details of benchmarking (what hardware was used, parameter settings) should be made more explicit (some are in the appendix).
*   **JIT Connectivity Sampling Method Justification:** Listing S2 mentions the uniform random integer sampling is faster but doesn't explicitly state why this particular distribution is being used and what are its drawbacks compared to the geometric distribution.
*   **Code Snippet Justification:** The code snippets comparing BrainPy with flax and haiku could provide more rationale why such a example should be chosen for the comparison.

**Specific Comments/Questions:**

*   **Abstract:** The abstract claims that BrainPy introduces "complete capabilities for flexible, efficient, and scalable brain simulation." This statement might be too strong. It would be more accurate to say that BrainPy introduces *significant advancements* in these areas.
*   **Introduction:** The introduction could briefly mention the challenges of training spiking neural networks due to the non-differentiability of the spiking function.
*   **Section 3: The Design of BrainPy:** The description of the multi-scale model building interface is somewhat abstract. Providing a small, concrete example of how this interface is used would be helpful. A figure displaying the architecture is also needed.
*   **Section 4.1: Dedicated Operators:** It would be valuable to briefly explain *why* the sparse and event-driven operators are more efficient than dense operators for brain dynamics.
*   **Section 4.2: Scalable Simulation:** The paper mentions a JIT connectivity algorithm with "extremely low sampling complexity." It would be helpful to quantify this complexity and compare it to other approaches. Also, how reproducible are simulations using JIT connectivity, given its dynamic nature?
*   **Section 4.3: Integrating Models:** More detail about how the "AlignPre" and "AlignPost" projections are implemented and how they reduce memory consumption would be beneficial. What are the computational trade-offs? Appendix D covers some details, but they should be better highlighted in the main text.
*   **Section 4.4: Flexible Modeling:** A diagram explaining the hierarchical composition that supports this is needed.
*   **Section 5.3: Training Functional Brain Dynamics Models:** Provide more detail on the architecture of the spiking network used for the working memory task. Which parameters are being trained? How sensitive is the performance to the choice of these parameters? What happens if you use only a rate network vs. spiking network?
*   **Reproducibility Statement:** Should include information such as the software version of JAX, etc.
*   **Figures:** Several figures are referenced from the appendix (e.g., Figure S7, S16). These are important for understanding the paper and should be explicitly discussed in the main body of the text, not just mentioned.

**Overall Assessment:**

BrainPy is a promising new tool that has the potential to significantly advance the field of brain simulation and brain-inspired computing. The paper presents a novel approach and demonstrates the key capabilities of the simulator. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would further strengthen the paper and make it more impactful. I would recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
