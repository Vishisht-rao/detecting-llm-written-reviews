Here's a review of the paper "Generalized Policy Iteration Using Tensor Approximation for Hybrid Control," submitted to ICLR 2024:

**Review Summary:**

The paper presents Tensor Train Policy Iteration (TTPI), a novel Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) algorithm designed to address the challenges of optimal control in systems with hybrid action spaces. TTPI leverages Tensor Train (TT) decomposition to efficiently represent the state-value and advantage functions, allowing it to handle both continuous and discrete action components. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of TTPI through benchmark simulation experiments, outperforming Deep RL baselines, and showcases its applicability in a real-world robotics experiment involving non-prehensile manipulation. The work is well-motivated, clearly presented, and offers a promising approach for hybrid control in robotics.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The paper introduces a genuinely novel algorithm, TTPI, that specifically targets the challenging problem of hybrid action spaces in optimal control. The use of TT decomposition within a Generalized Policy Iteration framework is a unique contribution.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The mathematical formulation of the algorithm is well-defined, and the paper clearly explains how TT-Cross is used for function approximation and TTGO for policy retrieval. The discussion of handling stochastic systems also adds depth.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The paper provides both simulation and real-world experimental results to support its claims. The simulation experiments demonstrate the superiority of TTPI over established Deep RL methods like HyAR, HPPO, and PDQN on benchmark problems. The real-world experiment on a planar pushing task further strengthens the paper's impact.
*   **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is well-written and organized. The motivation for the approach is clear, the algorithm is explained in detail, and the experimental results are presented concisely. The inclusion of an appendix provides further technical details.
*   **Addresses a Relevant Problem:** Optimal control with hybrid actions is a significant challenge in robotics, and this paper makes a valuable contribution toward addressing this problem.
*  **Appendices provide helpful context:** The appendices add important context to the paper, going more into Tensor Train model, cross approximation methods, etc.
*  **Compares Tensor Train Models with Neural Networks:** The paper makes a useful comparison of Tensor Train models with Neural Networks in the appendix, which is an important addition.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Scalability Concerns:** While the paper demonstrates good performance on the tasks considered, it acknowledges the limitations of TTPI in handling very high-dimensional state spaces or systems where the value functions are not low-rank in the TT representation. This limitation needs to be highlighted more prominently, as it could restrict the applicability of the method to certain types of robotic systems.
*   **Simulator Dependence:** The algorithm's reliance on a highly parallelized simulator could be a bottleneck for some applications, particularly those involving complex contact dynamics where hand-coding the system dynamics is impractical. This reliance should be made clear.
*  **Real Robot experiments aren't compared to the Deep RL methods:** The real robot experiments are not compared to the Deep RL methods, so the reader does not know how those algorithms would have performed in real robot experiments.
*   **Baselines:** The baselines are acknowledged to address a different problem that is technically more difficult than what TTPI is meant to solve. However, TTPI assumes access to a simulator and relies on simulator access more than these Deep RL methods.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Elaborate on Scalability Limitations:** Provide a more detailed discussion of the types of systems where TTPI is likely to be effective and where it might struggle due to the low-rank assumption. Consider discussing potential strategies for mitigating these limitations, such as adaptive discretization or hierarchical TT representations.
*   **Address Simulator Requirements:** Discuss the challenges of obtaining and parallelizing accurate simulators for complex robotic systems. Consider exploring the use of GPU-accelerated simulators like NVIDIA Isaac Gym to address this limitation.
*  **Compare Real Robot performance to Deep RL methods if possible:** This would allow the reader to gain a better sense of the tradeoffs between the two methods.
*   **Ablation study:** Include an ablation study to show the impact of different parts of the algorithm on the final result.

**Overall Score:**

I would rate this paper as a **Strong Accept**. The paper presents a novel and technically sound algorithm for hybrid control, with compelling simulation and real-world experimental results. While the limitations of the approach need to be acknowledged and addressed more fully, the paper represents a significant contribution to the field of robotics and optimal control.
