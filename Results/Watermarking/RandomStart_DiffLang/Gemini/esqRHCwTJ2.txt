## Review of "LONG -TERM IMPACTS OF MODEL RETRAINING WITH STRATEGIC FEEDBACK"

**Overall Assessment:** This research examines a context critical to the responsible deployment of machine learning models in real-world settings where human agents can strategically adapt their behavior in response to model decisions. The paper tackles the problem of model retraining with strategic feedback, analyzing the long-term impacts on qualification rates, acceptance rates, and fairness. The approach combines theoretical analysis with experimental validation, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of these systems. While the paper makes several contributions, some areas could be strengthened, including further clarifying assumptions and expanding the discussion of limitations.

**Strengths:**

*   **Important and Relevant Problem:** The paper addresses a crucial and increasingly prevalent challenge in applied machine learning. As ML systems are deployed for high-stakes decisions, understanding and mitigating the effects of strategic manipulation is paramount.
*   **Strong Theoretical Foundation:** The authors provide a formal framework for analyzing the interactions between agents and ML systems, deriving theoretical results about the evolution of key metrics.
*   **Combined Theoretical and Empirical Approach:** The paper effectively blends theoretical analysis with experimental validation on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets, which reinforces the key findings.
*   **Practical Considerations:** The paper considers practical constraints such as the high cost of human annotation and the use of model-annotated samples for retraining, making the analysis more realistic and applicable.
*   **Fairness Analysis:** The investigation of how model retraining impacts algorithmic fairness across social groups is a valuable addition, highlighting potential unintended consequences and proposing interventions.
*   **Clear Presentation (generally):** The paper is generally well-structured and written, making it relatively easy to follow the authors' reasoning.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Assumption Justification:** While the assumptions made are clearly stated, the justification for *why* they are reasonable in certain contexts could be strengthened. For example, while Assumption 3.1 (negligible algorithmic bias) simplifies the analysis, more discussion is needed about how the choice of a linear hypothesis class might limit the applicability of the results, even in cases where delta(D\_t, F) is *not* negligible. The "all experiments in Sec. 5 and Appendix naturally capture Î´pDt,Fq" isn't sufficient to fully justify this simplification.
*   **Clarity on the Intervention Mechanism:** The refined retraining process, utilizing a probabilistic sampler, could benefit from a more intuitive explanation of why this helps "stabilize the dynamics." While the mathematical reasoning is present, a more conceptual understanding would make it more accessible. For example, a short paragraph explaining the connection between the proposed procedure and concepts in causal inference or regularization may improve the understanding of this section.
*   **Limited Discussion of Limitations:** While the conclusion mentions limitations, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion within the main body. Specifically, the applicability of the theoretical results under different cost structures, agent models, and data distributions should be explored further. Moreover, the experiment results in Credit Approval data show trends that are "approximately aligned with the theoretical results." A more detailed description on what exactly is "approximately aligned with the theoretical results" may help the reader better grasp what the paper intends to express.
*   **Overclaiming?** Some of the statements appear a little too strong given the assumptions. For example, is "perfect fairness" *really* achieved, or is it just "significantly improved fairness" under the noisy setting? Given that, at least in the experiments, the fairness seems to worsen with more turns of retraining.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Strengthen Assumption Justifications:** Provide more context and justification for the assumptions made, discussing potential limitations and trade-offs associated with each.
*   **Elaborate on Intervention Mechanism:** Offer a more intuitive explanation of how the probabilistic sampler stabilizes the dynamics in the refined retraining process. Consider adding a visual aid or analogy.
*   **Expand Discussion of Limitations:** Dedicate a section to discussing the limitations of the approach, including the sensitivity of the results to specific assumptions, cost structures, agent models, and data distributions.
*   **Clarify relationship between experiment and theory on Credit Approval Data**: The authors could clarify the extent of the agreement and potential reasons for the observed deviations.
*   **Tone down language**: To make the paper more convincing, avoid overclaiming, for example, in section 4, the authors could say "significantly improved fairness" or "near-perfect fairness".

**Minor Comments:**

*   There are multiple locations that are ungrammatical, or awkward. The authors need to be more cautious on this. For example, page 2 second paragraph, "Stand used to make admission decisions. For students who apply in the pt`1q-th year, they will best respond to the model ftin the previous year (e.g., preparing the application package in a way that maximizes the chance of getting admitted)."
*   The caption in Figure 3 is too long, split it up into multiple sentences.
*   There is an extra blank line between the title and "Abstract"
*   Some citations in related works are missing in the reference section.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend this paper for acceptance at ICLR 2024, contingent on addressing the weaknesses outlined above. The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of responsible machine learning, offering theoretical insights and practical recommendations for mitigating the negative impacts of strategic feedback in model retraining. Addressing the areas for improvement will further enhance the clarity, rigor, and applicability of this research.
