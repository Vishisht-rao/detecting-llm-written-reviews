OUTPUT:
Okay, here's a review of the provided conference paper, starting with the requested opening statement and attempting to capture the strengths and weaknesses of the work:

**The research explores an important domain**: long-tailed data distributions pose a significant challenge for diffusion models, hindering their ability to generate diverse and high-quality samples, especially for under-represented classes. This paper proposes a novel approach, "Oriented Calibration" (OC), to address this issue by facilitating knowledge transfer from head to tail classes within a Bayesian framework.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses a Significant Problem:** The paper tackles a well-known limitation of diffusion models: their struggle with long-tailed datasets. Improving generation performance on tail classes is crucial for real-world applications where data imbalance is common.
*   **Novelty of Approach:** The core idea of directly calibrating tail class scores using head class samples as references ("T2H") is a fresh perspective.  It moves away from relying solely on conditional model predictions, which can be biased and lead to instability.  The introduction of the gating mechanism further refines the knowledge transfer process.
*   **Sound Theoretical Justification:** The paper provides a good theoretical foundation using a Bayesian framework and importance sampling. The statistical analysis connecting knowledge transfer effectiveness to label distribution and sample similarity offers valuable insights. Proposition 3.1 is particularly insightful in quantifying the transition strength.
*   **Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation:** The paper presents extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, TinyImageNet), demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method (T2H) compared to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based long-tail generation techniques (CBGAN, gSR-GAN, CBDM). The ablation studies clearly show the benefits of each component (conditional generation, batch re-sampling, T2H/H2T).
*   **Strong Results:** The quantitative results (FID and IS scores) consistently show that the OC method outperforms baselines, especially on more skewed datasets. The class-wise FID analysis provides a granular view of the improvements.
*   **Insightful Analysis:** The paper delves into the relationships between T2H, H2T and Î² values and provides results illustrating robustness over long training times.
*   **Clear Writing (Generally):** The abstract and introduction clearly articulate the problem and the proposed solution. The paper is generally well-structured.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Complexity and Clarity (Sometimes):** While the theoretical foundation is a strength, the paper can be dense and difficult to follow in certain sections, particularly in the detailed mathematical derivations (e.g., Section 3, Appendices). The notation could be more carefully introduced and consistently used. Some readers might struggle to grasp the intuition behind the equations without a deeper background in diffusion models and Bayesian inference.
*   **Limited Visualization of Qualitative Results:** While quantitative results are excellent, the qualitative visualization of generated images is limited (Appendix L). A more comprehensive visual comparison showing the diversity and quality of generated images for different classes (especially tail classes) would further strengthen the paper. It would be helpful to see a qualitative comparison between OC and other methods visually.
*   **Batch Re-sampling Justification:** While the "Batch Re-sample" strategy is mentioned, the reasons behind *why* it helps in both conditional and unconditional generation could be more explicitly explained and intuitively justified in the main paper rather than primarily in the appendix J. The toy Gaussian example in Figure 4 is helpful, but the connection to the core method could be strengthened.
*   **H2T Discussion:** the explanation of how to choose between H2T and T2H is a bit buried. A guiding principle for practitioners on choosing between H2T and T2H could be mentioned in the experimental setup section.
*   **Typos and Grammatical Errors:** The paper contains a noticeable number of typos, grammatical errors, and formatting inconsistencies. Careful proofreading is necessary before publication. (e.g., "state-the-of-the-art" should be "state-of-the-art," inconsistent capitalization, and minor grammatical issues throughout).
*   **Limited Discussion of Limitations:** While the paper demonstrates strong performance, a brief discussion of potential limitations or failure cases of the proposed method would enhance its credibility. Are there specific types of datasets or scenarios where OC might struggle?
*   **Appendix Formatting**: the appendix is less well formatted than the main body.
*   **Some sections could be shortened:** The related works section could be shortened given the space constraints.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Improve Clarity:** Revisit the mathematical derivations and provide more intuitive explanations. Consider adding more intermediate steps and examples to guide the reader through the more complex sections.
*   **Enhance Visualizations:** Include more qualitative results, showing a visual comparison of generated images from the proposed method and baseline methods, especially focusing on the tail classes.
*   **Strengthen Batch Re-sampling Explanation:**  Elaborate on the motivation and benefits of the "Batch Re-sample" strategy in the main text, connecting it more directly to the problem of long-tailed distributions and head class dominance.
*   **Thorough Proofreading:**  Carefully proofread the paper to correct typos, grammatical errors, and formatting inconsistencies.
*   **Consider a dedicated section for choosing between H2T and T2H, or provide guiding principles in the conclusion.**

**Overall:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of long-tailed generation with diffusion models. The proposed method, Oriented Calibration (OC), is novel, theoretically sound, and experimentally validated. While some sections could benefit from improved clarity and more detailed explanations, the overall quality of the work is high. With some revisions, this paper is a strong candidate for acceptance.
