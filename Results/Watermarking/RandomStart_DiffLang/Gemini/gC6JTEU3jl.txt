**Review of "BESA: PRUNING LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS WITH BLOCKWISE PARAMETER-EFFICIENT SPARSITY ALLOCATION"**

**Overall Summary:**

This paper addresses the important problem of pruning large language models (LLMs) to reduce their computational cost and memory footprint. The authors propose a novel technique called Blockwise Parameter-Efficient Sparsity Allocation (BESA) that aims to improve upon existing layer-wise pruning methods like SparseGPT and Wanda. BESA distinguishes itself by focusing on minimizing reconstruction error at the block level and employing a differentiable approach to allocate sparsity across layers. The paper presents experimental results demonstrating that BESA achieves state-of-the-art performance in pruning LLaMA models, along with simulation results using the VITCoD accelerator. The paper tackles a problem of great practical significance and offers an interesting solution.

**Strengths:**

*   **Relevance and Importance:** LLM compression is a crucial research area, making this work highly relevant. The introduction clearly articulates the motivation for pruning LLMs due to their computational demands.
*   **Novelty:** The blockwise pruning approach with differentiable sparsity allocation is a significant departure from traditional layer-wise methods. The parameter-efficient sparsity learning is also a valuable contribution.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The paper provides a clear explanation of the BESA algorithm, including the blockwise pruning objective, the parameter-efficient sparsity learning mechanism, and the joint optimization with quantization. The equations are well-defined, and the algorithm is presented logically. The use of straight-through estimation for differentiability is a standard and appropriate technique.
*   **Experimental Results:** The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, covering perplexity on standard datasets (WikiText2, C4, PTB) and zero-shot performance on common-sense reasoning tasks. The ablation studies provide insights into the key design choices of BESA.
*   **Clarity of Writing:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The figures are helpful in illustrating the BESA pipeline.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors have released their code, enhancing the reproducibility and impact of their work.
*   **ViTCoD accelerator simulation:** The paper provides results on the ViTCoD accelerator, which is a good way to demonstrate the potential for hardware acceleration.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Comparison:** While the comparison to SparseGPT and Wanda is appropriate, the landscape of LLM pruning is rapidly evolving. The authors should consider comparing BESA to other recent pruning methods, especially those leveraging structured sparsity or knowledge distillation techniques. The paper could be enhanced by contrasting BESA against other approaches in more fine-grained detail, beyond just performance metrics.
*   **Clarity on Computational Cost:** The paper mentions efficient pruning on a single A100 GPU in a few hours. However, a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of the BESA algorithm itself is warranted. How does the overhead of the differentiable sparsity allocation compare to the savings achieved through pruning? A complexity analysis or runtime breakdown would be valuable.
*   **Justification of Design Choices:** While the ablation studies are helpful, some design choices could benefit from further justification. For example, why was Wanda chosen as the importance metric? How sensitive is BESA to the specific choice of candidate pruning rates {pd}? More rigorous experimentation of different candidates would strengthen the argument that BESA is an improvement.
*   **Sparsity Pattern:**  The paper mentions that BESA seeks optimal pruning rate for each layer, which poses challenges in achieving structured sparsity. While the ViTCoD simulations partially address this, the lack of structured sparsity is a potential limitation for deployment on standard GPUs. A discussion of potential strategies to impose structured sparsity within the BESA framework would be valuable.
*   **Limited zero-shot improvement:** The authors mention that BESA even achieves higher average accuracy than the original dense model in LLaMA-65B in the zero-shot experiments. Given that the zero-shot experiments are sensitive, the authors need to provide a more careful analysis of this result.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand Baselines and Discussion:** Include a more comprehensive comparison to recent LLM pruning techniques, elaborating on the trade-offs between different approaches.
*   **Provide Complexity Analysis:** Add a section analyzing the computational complexity of the BESA algorithm, considering the overhead of the differentiable sparsity allocation.
*   **Deepen Ablation Studies:** Extend the ablation studies to investigate the sensitivity of BESA to the choice of candidate pruning rates and explore other importance metrics.
*   **Address Sparsity Structure:** Discuss potential strategies for incorporating structured sparsity into the BESA framework, even if it involves a slight performance trade-off.
*   **Analyze zero-shot experiment:** Elaborate on the zero-shot experiment. Provide more information about the prompt used, the standard deviation of the accuracy, and compare against the state of the art.

**Conclusion:**

The paper presents a promising approach to LLM pruning with the introduction of BESA. The blockwise pruning and differentiable sparsity allocation are novel and effective. While the paper has some limitations, particularly in the comparison to other methods and the lack of structured sparsity, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. With the suggested improvements, this paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of LLM compression.
