OUTPUT:
The article focuses on a critical aspect of reinforcement learning: addressing long-horizon tasks with improved interpretability and generalizability. The paper proposes a novel framework called Program Machine Policies (POMPs), which combines the strengths of programmatic RL (for interpretability and scalability) and state machine policies (for inductive generalization to long horizons). The core idea is to represent complex behaviors as a state machine where each state (mode) is a program synthesized from a domain-specific language (DSL).

**Strengths:**

*   **Addressing a Significant Problem:** The paper directly tackles the limitations of existing RL methods, specifically the inability to handle long-horizon tasks while maintaining interpretability. This is a well-motivated and relevant problem in the field.
*   **Novel Approach:** POMPs offer a creative solution by integrating program synthesis and state machines. The three-stage framework (program embedding space, mode program retrieval, transition function learning) is logically structured and addresses the key challenges.
*   **Clear Explanation:** The paper clearly explains the proposed approach, including the problem formulation, the three-stage framework, and the details of each component (program embedding space, CEM-based mode retrieval, transition function learning). The diagrams (Figures 2 and 3) are helpful in understanding the process.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper provides a thorough experimental evaluation, including comparisons with deep RL and programmatic RL baselines, ablation studies, and analysis of program sample efficiency and inductive generalization.
*   **Well-Defined Metrics:** Introducing the concept of "program sample efficiency" is a valuable contribution for evaluating programmatic RL methods.
*   **New Benchmark:** The introduction of the KAREL-LONG problem set is a significant contribution, providing a challenging benchmark for evaluating long-horizon RL methods with a focus on interpretability.
*   **Ablation Studies:** The ablation studies are well-designed and clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed diversity multiplier and compatibility consideration in the mode retrieval process. The comparison of different CEM variants (CEM x |M|, CEM+diversity top k, CEM+diversity x |M|, POMP) is convincing.
*   **Inductive Generalization Results:** The inductive generalization results (Figure 6b, 9) are impressive, showing that POMPs can generalize to longer horizons with minimal performance degradation compared to other methods.
*   **Detailed Appendix:** The extensive appendix provides further details about the experimental setup, hyperparameters, datasets, and extracted state machines, enhancing the reproducibility of the work.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Computational Cost of Program Synthesis:** The paper mentions that the transition function (neural network) is interpretable and state machine extraction is possible, but program synthesis, especially retrieving those compatible programs from embeddings, is still computationally expensive. The details on the hardware specification in conducting the experiments are missing. It would be useful to include a discussion on the computational complexity and scalability of the approach, particularly in relation to the size of the DSL and the length of the horizon.
*   **Limited Scope of DSL:** While the Karel domain is suitable for demonstrating the proof of concept, the DSL is somewhat limited. How would the framework scale to more complex domains with richer action spaces and perceptual inputs? Adding a discussion of domain-specific language expansion will enhance the paper.
*   **Interpretability vs. Scalability Trade-off:** While the framework introduces interpretability via symbolic program extraction, a detailed analysis of the trade-off between interpretability and scalability is missing. Exploring how the complexity of programs in the mode increases as tasks grow more intricate and its effect on interpretability will greatly strengthen the paper.
*   **Justification for the fixed number of modes:** The paper uses a fixed number of modes (|M|=5) for the state machine. A discussion on how this number was chosen and its impact on performance would be beneficial. An ablation study with different values of |M| could strengthen the analysis.
*   **Limited Comparisons:** The approach only compares to programmatic RL baselines with rather simple DSLs (such as those in the Karel Environment). Could more direct comparisons with HRL approaches utilizing neural networks to control pretrained skills be implemented?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Discuss the computational cost and scalability more thoroughly.** Include details on the hardware used for experiments, the time complexity of the program synthesis process, and the limitations of the approach in terms of DSL size and horizon length.
*   **Address the DSL scope.** How to apply this to a more complex domain should be justified.
*   **Elaborate on the interpretability vs. scalability trade-off.** Provide a deeper analysis of how the complexity of the programs in the modes affects the overall interpretability of the learned policy.
*   **Explain the choice of the number of modes ( |M| ).** Include a justification for using |M|=5 and consider adding an ablation study with different values of |M|.
*   **Compare with HRL approaches:** Integrate direct comparisons with HRL approaches that have neural networks to control pretrained skills or more complex DSLs.

**Overall Assessment:**

The paper presents a strong and promising approach to addressing the challenges of long-horizon RL with improved interpretability. The proposed POMP framework is well-motivated, clearly explained, and thoroughly evaluated. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, and the ablation studies provide valuable insights into the importance of diversity and compatibility in the mode retrieval process. Addressing the weaknesses and incorporating the suggestions for improvement would further strengthen the paper and make it an even more significant contribution to the field.

**I recommend this paper for acceptance, pending minor revisions to address the points raised above.**
