OUTPUT:
This paper explores the key problem of reconstructing accurate 3D shapes of reflective objects from multi-view images, a challenging task where existing neural radiance field (NeRF)-based methods often struggle due to the entanglement of specular radiance and complex geometry. The authors propose a novel approach called Gaussian-guided Neural Reconstruction of Reflective Objects with Noisy Polarization Priors (GNeRP), which uses a Gaussian-based representation of normals within Signed Distance Function (SDF) fields, supervised by polarization priors. The paper also introduces a Degree of Polarization (DoP) based reweighting strategy to address the noise inherent in polarization information.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novel Approach:** The core idea of representing normals as Gaussian fields within SDFs, coupled with splatting these Gaussians onto the image plane for polarization supervision, is innovative. It offers a more informative geometric representation compared to scalar SDFs and provides a direct way to leverage polarization priors.
*   **Addressing Noise in Polarization:** The DoP-based reweighting strategy is a valuable contribution, as it acknowledges and tackles the noise issue that affects polarization information, particularly in diffuse regions. This leads to more robust reconstruction.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The authors collected a new challenging dataset (PolRef) specifically designed for evaluating reflective object reconstruction. This dataset includes both radiance and polarimetric images, along with ground truth meshes, enabling quantitative comparisons. The inclusion of both real and synthetic data is also a strength. The comparison to a good number of state-of-the-art methods is thorough.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the proposed method and experimental setup. The figures and visualizations are helpful in understanding the concepts.
*   **Solid Results:** The experimental results demonstrate that GNeRP outperforms existing methods on reflective object reconstruction, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the individual components of the proposed approach.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Reliance on Polarimetric Data:** The method's reliance on polarimetric imaging is a significant limitation. Polarimetric cameras have lower imaging quality and are more susceptible to noise than standard RGB cameras. This limits the applicability of the method to scenarios where such equipment is available. While not a fundamental flaw, it's a practical constraint.
*   **Computational Cost:** The paper acknowledges that the method doesn't incorporate recent NeRF acceleration techniques, resulting in higher training and inference times. While this is a common issue in the field, it would be beneficial to address this limitation in future work.
*   **Failure Case Explanation:** The failure case analysis, while included, could be more in-depth. A more detailed explanation of why shading leads to inaccurate polarimetric cues and subsequent reconstruction errors would be valuable.
*   **Limited Discussion of Parameters:** While the Appendix mentions hyperparameter selection, a more detailed discussion on the sensitivity of the method to different parameter settings would improve the paper.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address Hardware limitation:** While it might be expensive, acquiring higher-quality polarimetric data may improve the results. Discuss some methods of overcoming the current limitation.
*   **Explore alternative polarization priors:** Could synthetic data or other sources be used to compensate for limited polarimetric data in some scenarios?
*   **Investigate Robust Loss Functions:** Explore robust loss functions that are less sensitive to noise in both radiance and polarization data.
*   **Accelerated Training/Inference:** Incorporate NeRF acceleration techniques (e.g., Instant-NGP, Voxel) to reduce the computational cost.
*   **Detailed Failure Case Analysis:** Provide a more detailed analysis of the failure cases, including the specific factors that contribute to inaccurate reconstruction.

**Overall:**

GNeRP is a significant contribution to the field of 3D reconstruction of reflective objects. The proposed Gaussian-based normal representation and DoP-based reweighting strategy are innovative and effective. The comprehensive evaluation on a newly collected dataset further strengthens the paper. While the reliance on polarimetric data and computational cost are limitations, the paper presents a promising approach with clear potential for future research. The paper is well-written and organized, making it accessible to a wide audience. I recommend accepting this paper.
