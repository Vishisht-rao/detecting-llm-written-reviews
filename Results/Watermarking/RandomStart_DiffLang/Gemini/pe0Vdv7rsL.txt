**Review of "Graph Transformers on EHRs: Better Representation Improves Downstream Performance"**

The paper addresses an important and timely problem in healthcare informatics: how to effectively leverage both graph-based and transformer-based methods for predictive tasks using electronic health records (EHRs). The authors correctly identify that while both approaches have shown promise individually, their integration is challenging due to EHR complexities like sparsity and the difficulty in capturing meaningful temporal representations.  The proposed method, GT-BEHRT, attempts to bridge this gap by using a graph transformer to generate visit embeddings, which are then fed into a BERT-based model to learn patient representations. The paper also introduces a two-step pre-training strategy to improve representation learning. The experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on several standard medical predictive tasks, suggesting the potential of the approach.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses a significant problem:** Combining graph and temporal information in EHR analysis is a crucial area for improvement. The paper clearly articulates the limitations of existing methods and motivates the need for a unified approach.
*   **Novel approach:** The GT-BEHRT architecture is a well-reasoned attempt to integrate the strengths of graph transformers and BERT. The use of a graph transformer to create visit-level embeddings addresses the sparsity issue and provides a more robust representation for the subsequent temporal modeling by BERT.
*   **Clear methodology:** The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the GT-BEHRT architecture, the pre-training strategy (NAM, MNP, VTP), and the experimental setup. The figures are helpful in visualizing the architecture and pre-training process.
*   **Comprehensive evaluation:** The paper evaluates GT-BEHRT on a variety of standard medical predictive tasks and datasets (MIMIC-IV and All of Us). The comparison against a range of strong baselines, including RNN-based, transformer-based, and GNN-based methods, provides a comprehensive evaluation landscape.
*   **Strong results:** The experimental results demonstrate that GT-BEHRT consistently outperforms the baselines on all metrics, particularly on the F1 score, suggesting improved performance in both precision and recall. The performance gains are statistically significant. The analysis of performance on longer medical histories is particularly insightful.
*   **Ablation study:** The ablation study provides valuable insights into the contribution of each component of GT-BEHRT, particularly the pre-training strategy and the use of graph transformers.
*   **Interpretability:** The graph-level interpretation and visualization of medical code embeddings is a valuable addition, as this can increase trust and understanding in the model's predictions for end-users.
*   **Well-written and organized:** The paper is well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the proposed method and the experimental results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Edge type in graph:** The paper mentions implicitly encoding the relationship type between two codes, "like, medication-medication, medication-diagnosis, etc.) as a spatial encoding," but it doesn't elaborate much on this aspect. More details about how this encoding is implemented and whether different types of relationship are tested in the experiment are necessary. How sensitive is the final performance to the relationship type?
*   **Scalability:** While the paper mentions the computational efficiency gains of visit-level transformers, it could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the scalability of GT-BEHRT to larger datasets and more complex EHRs. Although table 5 presents the time taken, more insights into how to further reduce the time taken should be given.
*   **Limited discussion of limitations:** While the paper presents a thorough evaluation, it could benefit from a more explicit discussion of the limitations of GT-BEHRT. For example, what types of medical predictive tasks might GT-BEHRT *not* be well-suited for? What are the potential biases in the datasets used, and how might these biases affect the performance of GT-BEHRT? In addition, the paper mentions fairness mitigation techniques but does not provide the actual results after mitigation.
*   **Missing Related Work:** The related work section is quite comprehensive, but it could potentially benefit from including any recent papers on attention mechanisms applied to graphs, especially in the healthcare field.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Elaborate on edge encoding:** Provide more details on how the relationships between medical codes are encoded as spatial embeddings, and do more experiments with different type of relationship.
*   **Discuss scalability in more detail:** Expand on the discussion of the scalability of GT-BEHRT, including potential strategies for handling larger datasets and more complex EHRs.
*   **Address limitations more explicitly:** Include a more explicit discussion of the limitations of GT-BEHRT and potential biases in the datasets used.
*   **Add some fairness mitigation results:** Include the results after applying fairness mitigation techniques.
*   **Final comments:** The paper suggests that the F1 score might not be the best metric because of the threshold. It would be better to provide other metrics that are threshold independent.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach for combining graph and temporal information in EHR analysis. The GT-BEHRT architecture and the two-step pre-training strategy are well-designed, and the experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on several standard medical predictive tasks. With some minor revisions, this paper would be a valuable contribution to the ICLR conference. I recommend acceptance, conditional on addressing the points mentioned above.
