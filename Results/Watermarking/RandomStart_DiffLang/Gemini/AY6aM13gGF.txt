## Review of "DOMODELS EXPLAIN THEMSELVES ? COUNTERFACTUAL SIMULATABILITY OF NATURAL LANGUAGE EXPLANATIONS"

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper presents a novel and important perspective on evaluating the quality of natural language explanations generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). The core idea of "counterfactual simulatability" - evaluating whether an explanation allows humans to accurately predict model behavior on related counterfactual inputs - is insightful and addresses a crucial gap in current explainability research. The proposed metrics, simulation precision and simulation generality, offer a practical framework for quantifying this property. The empirical evaluation, while limited to two tasks and explanation methods, provides valuable initial findings suggesting that current LLM explanations often fall short in terms of enabling accurate human understanding. The paper is well-written, clearly motivated, and contributes a valuable new perspective to the field of explainable AI.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The concept of counterfactual simulatability is a significant contribution. It moves beyond simply evaluating the plausibility or faithfulness of explanations and focuses on their utility in helping humans build accurate mental models of model behavior. This is essential for fostering trust and enabling appropriate human-AI collaboration.
*   **Clear Motivation and Problem Definition:** The introduction clearly articulates the problem and motivates the need for counterfactual simulatability. The illustrative example in Figure 1 effectively demonstrates how factually correct and logically coherent explanations can still be misleading and lead to incorrect mental models.
*   **Well-Defined Metrics:** Simulation precision and simulation generality provide a concrete and measurable framework for evaluating counterfactual simulatability. The detailed descriptions of how these metrics are implemented, including the use of LLMs for counterfactual generation and the framing of human simulation as a logical entailment task, are commendable.
*   **Sanity Checks:** The inclusion of sanity checks to validate the evaluation procedure is a strong point. Demonstrating that the procedure can discriminate between explanation systems of varying quality, that LLM simulators can approximate human simulators, and that LLM-prompted counterfactual generation outperforms a baseline enhances the credibility of the results.
*   **Discussion of Challenges and Solutions:** The paper acknowledges and addresses the challenges associated with human simulation (subjectivity, differing commonsense knowledge, and annotation cost), proposing thoughtful solutions that contribute to the rigor of the evaluation.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and easy to follow. The figures are helpful in illustrating the concepts and evaluation pipeline.
*   **Future Directions:** The "Future Directions" section thoughtfully explores potential extensions and improvements, highlighting the potential impact of this research on generation tasks, interactive model understanding, and developing more effective explanation methods.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Empirical Evaluation:** The empirical evaluation is limited in scope, focusing on only two tasks (StrategyQA and SHP) and two explanation methods (CoT and Post-Hoc). While the initial findings are valuable, further research is needed to assess the generalizability of these results to other tasks, models, and explanation techniques.
*   **Complexity of Human Annotation:** While the paper attempts to mitigate the subjectivity of the human simulation task by framing it as logical entailment, the annotation process still seems complex and potentially prone to noise. The fair to moderate inter-annotator agreement (IAA) suggests that further refinement of the annotation guidelines might be necessary.
*   **Reliance on LLMs for Counterfactual Generation and Simulation:** While the use of LLMs for counterfactual generation and simulation offers practical advantages in terms of scalability, it also introduces potential biases and limitations. The paper acknowledges this and performs sanity checks to mitigate concerns about simulation, but the reliance on LLMs remains a potential source of error. While the agreement between GPT-4 and Humans is close, GPT-4, like all LLMs, has biases and may not always make the same judgment as a human annotator.
*   **Lack of Correlation with Actionable Improvement:** The paper demonstrates a lack of correlation between plausibility and precision, implying that RLHF may be insufficient. However, it doesn't directly suggest alternative actionable strategies for _improving_ the counterfactual simulatability of LLM explanations. While future directions mention self-training or reinforcement learning on simulatability, the specific mechanisms for achieving such optimization are not explored in depth.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Expand the Empirical Evaluation:** Consider evaluating counterfactual simulatability on a wider range of tasks, including those involving more complex reasoning or requiring external knowledge. Explore different explanation methods, such as those based on attention mechanisms or feature importance.
*   **Refine Human Annotation Guidelines:** Based on an analysis of the disagreements between human annotators, refine the annotation guidelines to further reduce subjectivity and improve IAA.  Consider providing more detailed examples or incorporating a validation phase where annotators review and reconcile their initial judgments.
*   **Investigate the Impact of LLM Bias:** Conduct further analysis to assess the potential impact of LLM bias on counterfactual generation and simulation. Explore techniques for mitigating these biases, such as using diverse prompts or incorporating constraints into the LLM generation process.
*   **Explore Actionable Improvement Strategies:** Provide more concrete suggestions for how to improve the counterfactual simulatability of LLM explanations. This could involve exploring different training objectives, incorporating human feedback, or developing new explanation methods specifically designed to promote accurate human understanding. Further, this could involve explicitly probing LLM commonsense knowledge to ensure its alignment with human knowledge.
*   **Comparison with Human-Written Explanations:** It would be useful to understand what makes the counterfactuals created by humans different than those created by LLMs in Table 3. Is it the range, type, or quality of the counterfactuals that results in lower accuracy?

**Conclusion:**

Despite its limitations, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of explainable AI by introducing the concept of counterfactual simulatability and providing a practical framework for its evaluation. The paper's findings highlight the need for more effective explanation methods that enable humans to build accurate mental models of model behavior. I recommend this paper for acceptance at ICLR 2024, as it introduces an important problem and suggests promising directions for future research.
