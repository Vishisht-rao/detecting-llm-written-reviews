**Review of "Structured Packing in LLM Training Improves Long Context Utilization"**

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper addresses a critical challenge in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs): effective utilization of long contexts. The paper proposes a novel method called "Structured Packing for Long Context" (SPLICE) to improve long-context utilization by strategically constructing training examples consisting of mutually relevant documents. The core idea of increasing dependency density in training data by including related documents is well-motivated. The experimental results, including perplexity improvements and enhanced performance on downstream tasks, are promising. The paper is generally well-written and clearly presents the methodology and results.  However, certain aspects, especially regarding reproducibility and ablation studies, could be strengthened.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The SPLICE method is a novel approach to training LCLMs, offering a practical way to create training examples that encourage better context utilization. The use of retrieval methods (BM25/Contriever) to identify related documents is a good idea.
*   **Relevance:** The problem of long-context utilization is highly relevant to the current research landscape in LLMs. Addressing the limitations of existing LCLMs in effectively using long-range dependencies is a valuable contribution.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The paper provides empirical validation of SPLICE through extensive experiments with medium-scale (270M) and large-scale (3B and 7B) models. The improvements in perplexity on arXiv and StarCoder, along with enhanced performance on TREC, Qasper, and synthetic retrieval tasks, support the effectiveness of the proposed method.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and presents the methodology and results in a clear and understandable manner. The introduction effectively motivates the problem, and the method section provides a detailed explanation of SPLICE. The figures (e.g., Figure 1 and 2) are helpful in visualizing the approach.
*   **Thoroughness:** The authors provide a good exploration, in the appendix, of the design choices associated with SPLICE, including the order of documents and the hyperparameter k.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Reproducibility Concerns:** While the paper mentions reproducibility, some aspects of the data preparation and training process could be more transparent. Details such as hyperparameter tuning for BM25 and Contriever and the exact preprocessing steps for the datasets should be explicitly stated. It would also be useful to include the code for data preparation, in addition to the model code.
*   **Ablation Studies:** The ablation studies provided are helpful, but limited. Additional details about the ablation studies (e.g. hyperparameter search space, early stopping criteria) would be useful. A thorough hyperparameter search would better validate the performance of the method.
*   **Comparison to Existing Methods:** While the paper mentions related work, a more detailed comparison to other long-context training techniques (e.g., those using synthetic data augmentation or curriculum learning) would be beneficial. A clear explanation of how SPLICE differs from and potentially complements these approaches is needed.
*   **Dataset Specificity:** Most experiments are conducted on code data. While the authors show SPLICE's applicability to webtext, more extensive evaluation on diverse datasets would strengthen the generalizability of the findings. Do the benefits of SPLICE hold for other types of long-form content like books, legal documents, or news articles?
*   **BM25 Implementation:** The paper mentions using BM25 for retrieval. Clarifying which specific BM25 variant (e.g., BM25F) and library were used would be helpful for reproducibility. Also, the motivation for using BM25 vs. other, potentially more sophisticated, retrieval methods is not explicitly stated.

**Specific Comments and Questions:**

*   **Algorithm 1 (SPLICE training example construction):** The pseudocode is helpful, but a clearer explanation of the `TRIM(C, L)` function is needed. How is the context trimmed when the concatenated documents exceed the maximum length `L`?
*   **Data Mixtures:** In Section 3.1, the rationale for using a 50/50 mixture of RedPajama and long-context data is mentioned ("to prevent the model from overfitting to artificially created long documents"). It'd be helpful to include an ablation to see the performance for different ratios.
*   **Retrieval Method Choice:** Why use only the first 512 tokens for Contriever? Does this limit the retrieval effectiveness for longer documents? Is there a performance/accuracy trade-off?
*   **Negative Sampling:** Does the paper address the potential for SPLICE to over-emphasize positive examples (related documents) at the expense of negative examples (unrelated documents)? Could incorporating negative sampling techniques further improve the method?

**Recommendations:**

*   **Improve Reproducibility:** Provide more detailed information about the data preparation process, hyperparameter settings, and software versions used. Releasing the code for SPLICE method would be very beneficial.
*   **Expand Ablation Studies:** Conduct more comprehensive ablation studies to analyze the impact of different components of SPLICE and to optimize the hyperparameters.
*   **Broader Evaluation:** Evaluate SPLICE on a wider range of datasets and tasks to assess its generalizability.
*   **Clarify Design Choices:** Provide clearer justifications for the specific design choices made in SPLICE, such as the retrieval method and the context trimming strategy.
*   **Discuss Limitations in More Detail:** Expand the discussion of limitations, particularly regarding the potential biases introduced by the document retrieval process.

**Conclusion:**

This is a promising paper that presents a novel and effective method for improving long-context utilization in LLMs. The empirical results are encouraging, and the paper is generally well-written. Addressing the weaknesses identified above would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact. I recommend acceptance, pending revisions to address the concerns outlined in this review.
