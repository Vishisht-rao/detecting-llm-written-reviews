**Review**

**Summary:**

The manuscript tackles an important, previously unexplored problem: the interaction between label smoothing (LS) regularization and model inversion attacks (MIAs). The authors investigate whether LS, a widely used regularization technique in deep learning, impacts a model's vulnerability to MIAs, which aim to reconstruct training data characteristics from a trained classifier. Their key finding is that *positive* LS, the standard form, surprisingly *increases* a model's privacy leakage in the context of MIAs. Conversely, they demonstrate that *negative* LS can act as a practical defense, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of the utility-privacy trade-off. They provide extensive experimental results and ablation studies to support their claims, focusing primarily on face recognition tasks with high-resolution images.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The paper addresses a highly relevant and novel research question. The connection between regularization techniques like LS and privacy risks via MIAs is a crucial area to investigate. Prior to this work, the impact of LS on model privacy had not been systematically studied.
*   **Solid Experimental Evaluation:** The paper presents a comprehensive experimental evaluation. The experiments are well-designed, utilizing standard datasets (FaceScrub, CelebA) and state-of-the-art MIA techniques (Plug & Play Attacks, GMI, KED, etc.). The use of multiple metrics (Attack Accuracy, Feature Distance, Knowledge Extraction Score, FID, ECE) provides a thorough assessment of the impact of LS.
*   **Interesting and Counterintuitive Finding:** The finding that positive LS *increases* privacy leakage is both interesting and somewhat counterintuitive, given that LS is typically used to improve generalization and robustness.
*   **Practical Defense Mechanism:** The discovery that negative LS can serve as a defense against MIAs is valuable from a practical standpoint. The method is easy to implement (requires only a modification of the training process), doesn't require architectural changes, and offers a compelling utility-privacy trade-off.
*   **Detailed Analysis:** The ablation studies (especially the analysis of the different MIA stages) provide valuable insights into the mechanisms by which LS affects attack success. The analysis of the embedding space and the gradient similarity are particularly insightful.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized. The introduction clearly lays out the problem and contributions. The background section provides necessary context, and the experimental section is clearly presented.
* **User-Study:** The User-study offers a good insight on the qualitative performance improvement in terms of the success of the attacks after using a defense.
*   **Code Availability:** The availability of source code is a significant plus, enhancing reproducibility and facilitating future research.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Computational Cost of MIAs:** The authors acknowledge the high computational cost of MIAs, which limits the extent of hyperparameter tuning and sensitivity analysis. While this is understandable, it does mean that the results may not be fully optimized, and the optimal negative smoothing factor might vary depending on the specific dataset and model.
*   **Theoretical Framework:** The authors also acknowledge the lack of a comprehensive theoretical framework for MIAs. While their analysis is thorough, a more formal theoretical understanding of why negative LS works as a defense would further strengthen the paper.
*   **Limited Generalization Claims:** While the authors conduct experiments on image classification, it is unclear if the proposed method can be easily used in other domains.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Broader Dataset/Task Exploration:** While the focus on face recognition is relevant, exploring the effects of LS on MIAs in other image classification tasks (e.g., object recognition, medical imaging) or even in different data modalities (e.g., text) would strengthen the generalization of the findings.
*   **Discussion of Attack Adaptation:** The authors could discuss the potential for attackers to adapt their strategies to overcome the negative LS defense. For example, could MIAs be modified to explicitly target decision boundaries or to exploit the altered embedding space created by negative LS?
*   **Utility Metric Nuances:** The paper primarily uses test accuracy as the utility metric. It might be helpful to include other utility metrics, such as calibration error or robustness to adversarial examples, to provide a more complete picture of the utility-privacy trade-off.
*   **Clarify Negative LS Scheduler:** The paper mentions gradually increasing the negative smoothing factor during training. More detail about the specific scheduling function would be helpful for reproducibility.
*   **Theoretical Analysis:** While the formal analysis of the LS regularization adds significant value to the paper, extending it with new analysis explaining why the gradients are stable during positive LS and unstable for negative LS would improve the quality of the work.

**Overall Assessment:**

The manuscript presents valuable research that makes a significant contribution to the understanding of privacy risks in deep learning. The findings are novel, the experimental evaluation is thorough, and the proposed defense mechanism is practical. Despite some minor limitations, the paper is well-written, well-organized, and addresses an important problem.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend acceptance of the manuscript, with consideration of the suggestions for improvement. The paper is well-suited for presentation at ICLR 2024.
