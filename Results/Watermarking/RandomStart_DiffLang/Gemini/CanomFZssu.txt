**This article focuses on the key context of unsupervised graph anomaly detection and addresses the conflict between local inconsistency mining (LIM) and message passing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).**

**Summary:**

The paper introduces GADAM, a novel two-stage framework for unsupervised graph anomaly detection. The core idea is to decouple local inconsistency mining (LIM) from message passing, a common practice in GNNs. The authors argue that standard GNN message passing can smooth out anomaly signals, hindering LIM's effectiveness. GADAM first employs an MLP-based contrastive learning approach *without* message passing to obtain local anomaly scores. Then, it uses these scores as pseudo-labels in a second stage, where adaptive message passing (via a hybrid attention mechanism) is used to refine anomaly detection from a global perspective. The hybrid attention mechanism combines anomaly score difference and feature similarity to control message passing.  The authors demonstrate significant performance gains compared to existing state-of-the-art methods across a range of datasets, including large-scale OGB datasets.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addressing an Important Problem:** The paper tackles a critical and often overlooked issue in graph anomaly detection – the detrimental effect of GNN message passing on LIM. The analysis of the conflict is well-articulated and insightful.
*   **Novelty of Approach:** The proposed GADAM framework is novel and well-motivated. Decoupling LIM from message passing is a clever strategy. The hybrid attention mechanism is a key contribution, enabling adaptive message passing tailored to the characteristics of different nodes (normal, contextual anomaly, structural anomaly).
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The paper presents extensive experimental results on a diverse set of benchmark datasets. The results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of GADAM over several strong baselines in terms of ROC-AUC, Average Precision, and Recall@k. The inclusion of large-scale OGB datasets is particularly valuable, showing the scalability of the approach.
*   **Efficiency:** The paper demonstrates GADAM's efficiency in terms of runtime and GPU memory consumption compared to other methods. The time complexity analysis is also included.
*   **Ablation Studies:** The ablation studies provide a thorough understanding of the contributions of each component of GADAM. They clearly show the benefits of decoupling, the hybrid attention mechanism, and the two-stage approach.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The figures, especially Figure 2, effectively illustrate the GADAM framework.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Pseudo-Label Sensitivity:** While the paper discusses the robustness to pseudo-label accuracy in the ablation studies, further analysis of the optimal `kano` and `knor` parameters and their sensitivity to different graph structures/anomaly types would be valuable. Are there guidelines for setting these parameters?
*   **Limited Theoretical Justification:** Although Theorem 1 provides a theoretical justification for the second stage of GADAM, a more comprehensive theoretical analysis of the entire framework would be beneficial.
*   **Attention Visualization:** While the attention visualization in Appendix E is helpful, it's difficult to draw strong conclusions from just the mean attention values. A more in-depth analysis of specific examples (e.g., visualizing the attention weights for the neighbors of a specific anomalous node) could provide deeper insights.
*   **Related Work Breadth:** While the related work section covers relevant approaches, it could benefit from a slightly broader perspective on anomaly detection techniques beyond GNNs, even if those techniques are not directly applicable to graph data.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis:** Expand the discussion on the sensitivity of `kano` and `knor` parameters. Provide guidelines or heuristics for setting these parameters based on graph characteristics.
*   **Deeper Theoretical Analysis:** Explore the possibility of a more comprehensive theoretical analysis of the GADAM framework.
*   **More Detailed Attention Visualization:** Provide more detailed visualizations of the attention mechanism, focusing on specific nodes and their neighbors. Analyze the attention weights to understand which neighbors are considered most important.
*   **Minor Editorial Suggestions:**
    *   In section 3.3 it says "the parameters of GADAM are only the MLPs in two stages", and the MLP is refered to as "memory friendly". This claim should be made more carefully because MLPs can have a large number of parameters depending on the embedding dimensions and number of layers. The MLP might still be more efficient, but the argument should not be based on the number of parameters.

**Overall Score:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of unsupervised graph anomaly detection. The proposed GADAM framework is novel, well-motivated, and achieves impressive empirical results. The paper is well-written and easy to follow. While there are some areas for improvement, the strengths of the paper far outweigh its weaknesses.

**Recommendation:**

**Strong Accept.**
