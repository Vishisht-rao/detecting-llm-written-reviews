OUTPUT:
This study investigates the problem of training accurate and unbiased models on datasets plagued by multiple biases. The authors propose a novel method that reframes debiased training as a multi-task learning (MTL) problem, dividing the training data into groups based on their alignment with each bias. Each group then constitutes a separate task within the MTL framework. A key contribution is a weight adjustment algorithm, derived from multi-objective optimization (MOO) principles, aimed at achieving Pareto-stationary solutions. The authors also introduce a new real-image benchmark, MultiCelebA, designed to evaluate debiasing methods in realistic multi-bias scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multi-bias datasets, including MultiCelebA, and also exhibits strong performance on single-bias datasets.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The reframing of debiased training as an MTL problem is a significant and novel contribution. This perspective allows for the application of existing MTL and MOO techniques to address the challenges of multi-bias learning.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The proposed weight adjustment algorithm is grounded in MOO theory, providing a theoretical basis for its effectiveness. The connection to Pareto stationarity offers a principled approach to balancing performance across different bias groups.
*   **Empirical Evaluation:** The extensive experimental evaluation on a diverse set of datasets (MultiCelebA, UrbanCars, Multi-Color MNIST, Waterbirds, CelebA, BFFHQ) provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed method. The introduction of the MultiCelebA dataset is a valuable contribution to the field, as it addresses the need for realistic multi-bias benchmarks.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and clearly explains the proposed method and its connection to MTL and MOO. The figures and tables are helpful in understanding the experimental setup and results.
*   **Comprehensive Comparisons:** The paper provides thorough comparisons to a wide range of existing debiased training methods, including both those that require bias labels and those that do not.
*   **Ablation Studies:** The ablation studies, particularly the comparison of different strategies for adjusting the group-scaling parameter α and the ablation on the grouping strategy, are essential for understanding the individual contributions of different components of the proposed method.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Reliance on Bias Labels:** While the paper acknowledges the potential cost of bias labels, the proposed method relies on their availability. A discussion of the sensitivity of the method to noisy or inaccurate bias labels would be beneficial. Although the authors state unsupervised debiasing for the multi-bias setting is premature, further elaborating on potential future directions for unsupervised or semi-supervised extensions could enhance the paper's long-term impact.
*   **Complexity:** The algorithm, while theoretically sound, introduces additional hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate η2, update frequency U) compared to simpler debiasing methods. The sensitivity of the performance to these hyperparameters should be discussed more thoroughly. Table 7 addresses this concern to some extent, but additional justification for the selected values would be helpful.
*   **Justification for Hyperparameter Selection:** The rationale behind certain hyperparameter choices is not always clear. For instance, the choice of ResNet18 for MultiCelebA and BFFHQ and ResNet50 for other datasets could benefit from further explanation. Although following prior work, some discussion on computational constraints and performance trade-offs for this model selection would add value.
*   **Minor Clarity Issues:**
    *   In section 3.2.1, while the explanation is good, the notation with the argmax could be slightly clearer.
    *   The reference to empirical analysis from Scimeca et al. (2022) in Section 4 is a bit vague. A more detailed summary of their findings and how they relate to the chosen bias attributes would be useful. Appendix A.3 partially alleviates this concern, but integrating this into the main text could improve readability.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Sensitivity Analysis:** Conduct a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the proposed method to noisy or inaccurate bias labels.
*   **Unsupervised Extension Discussion:** Expand the discussion on potential future directions for unsupervised or semi-supervised extensions of the method.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning Explanation:** Provide a more detailed explanation of the hyperparameter tuning process and the rationale behind the selected values.
*   **Experiment details:** More implementation details for the various datasets and baselines could be included.
*   **Clarity:** Improve the argmax notation in Section 3.2.1 to ensure ease of comprehension. Expand the discussion of the relationship between the findings of Scimeca et al. (2022) and the chosen bias attributes in Section 4.

**Overall:**

This is a strong and well-executed paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of debiased training. The proposed method is novel, theoretically sound, and empirically effective. The introduction of the MultiCelebA dataset is a valuable addition to the community. While there are some minor weaknesses, they do not detract significantly from the overall quality of the paper. I recommend acceptance.
