**Review**

This paper explores an important and relatively unexplored aspect of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs): their behavior and generalization performance when solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in the vicinity of finite-time blow-up singularities. This is a crucial area of investigation, as many real-world physical phenomena are modeled by PDEs that exhibit such singularities. The authors focus on Burgers' equation as a test case, providing both theoretical generalization bounds and experimental validation.

**Strengths:**

*   **Important Research Question:** The paper addresses a significant gap in the existing literature on PINNs. Understanding how PINNs handle singularities is essential for their reliable application to a wider range of physical problems.
*   **Rigorous Approach:** The authors attempt a rigorous theoretical analysis, deriving generalization bounds for PINNs applied to Burgers' equation in arbitrary dimensions under conditions that allow for finite-time blow-up. This is a non-trivial undertaking, and the derivation of such bounds is a valuable contribution.
*   **Well-Defined Experiments:** The experiments are carefully designed to test the theoretical bounds and to investigate the correlation between the bounds and the actual L2 error as the solution approaches the singularity. The use of Burgers' equation with known analytical solutions allows for controlled study. The 2+1 dimensional case provides a more challenging and realistic scenario.
*   **Novelty:** The paper claims (and provides evidence) that existing PINN generalization bounds do not directly apply to the case of solutions arbitrarily close to finite-time blowup. The authors have made a genuine attempt to develop a theory that caters to this special case.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, with a clear introduction, related work section, presentation of main results, and description of experiments. The inclusion of an "Informal Summary of Results" is helpful.
*   **Stability Discussion:** The inclusion of stability properties of PINN bounds is a good addition that enhances the applicability of the results in practice.
*   **Sample Size Dependence:** Explicitly incorporating the sample-size dependence in the bounds by using quadrature rules is valuable.
*   **Code Availability:** Link to anonymized implementation promotes reproducibility.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Vacuous Bounds:** The authors acknowledge that the derived theoretical error bounds are "vacuous" in practice. While this is a common issue with generalization bounds for neural networks, it weakens the overall impact of the theoretical contribution. It's difficult to assess the real utility of the bounds if they don't provide meaningful numerical estimates.
*   **Correlation vs. Causation:** The paper highlights the correlation between the theoretical bounds and the L2 error. However, correlation does not imply causation. While the observed correlation is interesting, it is important to acknowledge that the bounds may not be *driving* the performance of the PINN. Other factors, such as the architecture, training procedure, or the specific form of the loss function, may be more influential.
*   **Limited Scope of Experiments:** While the use of Burgers' equation is justified, it is a relatively simple PDE. It would be beneficial to investigate more complex PDEs with finite-time blow-ups to assess the generalizability of the findings.
*   **Lack of Comparison to Other Methods:** The paper focuses on PINNs. Including a comparison to traditional numerical methods for solving PDEs near singularities would provide valuable context and demonstrate the potential advantages (or disadvantages) of PINNs in this setting.
*   **Justification of Hyperparameter Choice:** The choice of neural network architecture (6 layers deep, widths 30/300), optimizer (Adam), learning rate (1e-4), and number of iterations (100,000) should be justified in the paper. Why were those specific values used? Was a hyperparameter search performed? How sensitive are the results to these hyperparameters?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Strengthen Theoretical Results:** Explore ways to tighten the theoretical bounds. This could involve making stronger assumptions about the solution or the neural network architecture, or using more sophisticated techniques from approximation theory. One possibility is to explore bounds that are non-vacuous for specific problem instances or within certain parameter regimes.
*   **Investigate Causation:** Conduct further experiments to investigate the causal relationship between the theoretical bounds and the PINN's performance. This could involve manipulating the bounds (e.g., by adding regularizers) and observing the effect on the error.
*   **Expand Experimental Scope:** Extend the experiments to include more complex PDEs with finite-time blow-ups, such as the exponential reaction model or the semi-linear equations studied by Fujita. Consider also investigating problems in higher spatial dimensions.
*   **Compare to Traditional Methods:** Add a comparison to traditional numerical methods for solving PDEs near singularities, such as adaptive mesh refinement or finite difference schemes with specialized singularity treatment.
*   **Analyze Failure Cases:** Investigate cases where the PINN fails to accurately approximate the solution near the singularity. Understanding the failure modes could provide insights into the limitations of PINNs and suggest ways to improve their performance.
*   **Discuss Limitations More Explicitly:** The paper acknowledges that the theoretical bounds are vacuous. However, it would be helpful to discuss the limitations of the current approach more explicitly and to suggest directions for future research that could overcome these limitations.
*   **Hyperparameter tuning:** Explain the process of determining the optimal hyperparameters.

**Overall Assessment:**

This is a solid paper that tackles an important and challenging problem in the field of PINNs. The authors have made a significant effort to provide both theoretical and experimental insights into the behavior of PINNs near finite-time blow-up singularities. While the theoretical bounds are currently vacuous, the observed correlation between the bounds and the L2 error is intriguing and warrants further investigation. With some improvements, particularly in strengthening the theoretical results and expanding the experimental scope, this paper could make a valuable contribution to the community.
