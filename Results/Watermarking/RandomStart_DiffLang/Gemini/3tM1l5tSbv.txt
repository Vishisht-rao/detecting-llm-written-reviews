OUTPUT:
Okay, here's a review of the provided ICLR 2024 conference paper draft.

**Overall Assessment**

This paper presents a novel and potentially impactful approach to solving non-convex optimization problems with multi-valued input-solution mappings using a generative learning framework based on Rectified Flows (RectFlow). The core idea of learning the mapping from input to *solution distribution* rather than input to a single solution is well-motivated, theoretically justified, and empirically supported. The paper is generally well-written, clearly structured, and the experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over existing approaches. However, some aspects of the analysis and presentation could be strengthened.

**Strengths**

*   **Novelty:** The shift from learning a single input-solution mapping to learning an input-conditional solution distribution is a significant and insightful contribution. It directly addresses a fundamental limitation of standard supervised learning techniques when applied to non-convex problems with multiple optima.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The paper provides a good theoretical foundation for the proposed method. The use of RectFlow is well-explained, and Proposition 4.1 & 4.2 provides theoretical guarantees. The analysis of optimality loss and runtime complexity in Section 5 is particularly valuable. Theorem 1 provides quantifiable insights into the factors affecting solution quality.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The experiments are comprehensive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a variety of problems, including a toy example, continuous non-convex problems (inverse kinematics, wireless power control), and combinatorial optimization problems (maximum clique, etc.). The comparison against several baselines, including other generative models (GANs, Diffusion models), is crucial and compelling. The ablation study further strengthens the empirical analysis.
*   **Clarity of Writing:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The problem is clearly defined, the proposed solution is well-explained, and the results are presented logically.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors provide a code link, which is excellent and promotes reproducibility.

**Weaknesses and Suggestions for Improvement**

*   **Theoretical Depth & Assumptions:**
    *   *Assumption 1:*  While Boltzmann distributions are common, the paper could better justify its specific choice.  Are there other distribution families that could be equally or more suitable?  A discussion of the limitations of Assumption 1, and scenarios where it might not hold, would be helpful.
    *   *Theorem 1:*  The constants C1 and C2 in Theorem 1 depend on Lipschitz conditions, but the paper doesn't explicitly discuss how to estimate or bound these Lipschitz constants in practice for the neural networks used. A practical consideration of how these constants affect the results would be beneficial. It would also be nice to see results on the relationship between the training data size/quality and ϵθ.
    *   *KL Divergence Bound*: There is a brief discussion of KL divergence bound, which is great, but the paper mentioned the limitation of minimizing ϵθ for computational complexity reason. It is unclear what are the computational constraints in this case. More elaborations on this would be beneficial.
*   **Related Work:**
    *   The related work section is good, but could benefit from more in-depth discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each of the related approach. Table 1 helps, but more discussion in the main text would be valuable.
    *   The relationship of RectFlow to other ODE-based generative models (e.g., Neural ODEs) could be discussed in more details. Why is RectFlow specifically chosen, and what are its relative advantages/disadvantages for this application?
*   **Experiment Details:**
    *   While the Appendix contains some details, more specifics on the NN architectures, hyperparameter tuning process, and computational resources used would improve reproducibility. This is especially important for the more complex experiments like the combinatorial optimization problems.
    *   The paper mentions projection operations and greedy decoding strategies. Providing the algorithm and pseudo-code would be beneficial for better understanding and reproducing the results.
*   **Discussion and Limitations:**
    *   The paper would benefit from a more thorough discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach. For example, how does the method scale to very high-dimensional input spaces? Are there specific types of non-convex problems where it is likely to perform poorly? Are there ways to extend it to problems with discrete or mixed-integer decision variables more directly (rather than relying on relaxation and rounding)?
*   **Minor Points:**
    *   The abstract could be slightly more specific about the types of non-convex problems addressed.
    *   There are some minor grammatical errors ("Sec. 5. The results show..." should be "Sec. 5. The results show *that*..."). Proofread carefully.
    *   In the reference section, be consistent with the use of "arXiv preprint arXiv:..." or simply include the arxiv link in the paper entries.

**Recommendation**

I recommend this paper for acceptance at ICLR 2024, contingent on addressing the suggestions above. The paper presents a significant and well-executed contribution to the field of machine learning for optimization. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above will further strengthen the paper and increase its impact.
