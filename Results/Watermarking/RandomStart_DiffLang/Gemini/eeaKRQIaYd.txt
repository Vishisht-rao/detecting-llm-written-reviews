Here's a review of the paper "UNSUPERVISED SIGN LANGUAGE TRANSLATION AND GENERATION":

**Overall Assessment:**

This paper tackles a very important and challenging problem: sign language translation and generation (SLTG) in an unsupervised manner. Given the scarcity of parallel sign language video-to-text data, the proposed USLNet is a valuable contribution to the field. The idea of adapting unsupervised neural machine translation (UNMT) techniques to SLTG is innovative and promising. The paper is generally well-written and clearly outlines the proposed methodology. The experimental results, while not perfect, demonstrate the potential of the unsupervised approach, achieving competitive results compared to supervised baselines in some cases.  The identified challenges and ablation studies offer valuable insights for future research.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The paper presents the first unsupervised model (USLNet) for both sign language translation and generation, a significant contribution given the data scarcity issue.
*   **Problem Relevance:** SLTG is crucial for facilitating communication between deaf and hearing communities, making this research highly relevant.
*   **Methodology:** The adaptation of UNMT principles to the cross-modal SLTG problem is well-motivated. The proposed sliding window aligner to address the feature representation discrepancy between text and video is a key contribution.
*   **Experimental Results:** The competitive performance of USLNet compared to supervised baselines on the BOBSL dataset is encouraging and validates the effectiveness of the approach.  The improvement gained from unsupervised finetuning is particularly noteworthy.
*   **Ablation Studies and Analysis:** The detailed analysis of the impact of different components, particularly the sliding window aligner, and the discussion on the challenges and potential solutions (e.g., data distribution adjustment, freezing video encoder) demonstrate a thorough understanding of the problem and the model's behavior.
*   **Clear Presentation:** The paper is generally well-structured and clearly explains the USLNet framework and the training procedure. The figures and tables are helpful in understanding the methodology and results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **BLEU-4 Score:** While the BLEU-1 scores are competitive, the relatively low BLEU-4 scores, especially for sign language generation, indicate that the model struggles to generate fluent and coherent sequences. This suggests that the long-range dependencies and grammatical structure of sign language are not fully captured.
*   **Limited Comparative Results for Generation:**  The paper lacks direct comparison with other sign language *generation* models.  It only compares USLNet with and without joint training, which doesn't provide a strong benchmark for the generation capability.
*   **Dataset Specificity:** The experiments are conducted only on the BOBSL dataset. Evaluating the model on other datasets would strengthen the generalizability of the findings. The discussion acknowledges the challenges posed by the BOBSL dataset's large vocabulary and multiple signer bias, which makes understanding the results more difficult.
*   **Sliding Window Aligner Explanation:** While the concept of the sliding window aligner is presented, the mathematical notations and Gaussian distribution weighting (Eq. 8 and 9) could be further clarified with concrete examples. The rationale behind the specific probability intervals for current, adjacent, and other windows could be better explained.  A visual representation of the aligner's functionality would be beneficial.
*   **Implementation Details:** More details about the exact architecture and hyperparameters used for the text encoder, text decoder, video encoder, and video decoder would be beneficial for reproducibility.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address Low BLEU-4 Score:** Investigate methods to improve the fluency and coherence of the generated sequences.  This could involve exploring techniques like attention mechanisms, transformer architectures tailored for long sequences, or hierarchical decoding.
*   **Include Generation Baselines:**  Compare USLNet's sign language *generation* performance with existing (even supervised) generation models, even if they're not directly comparable due to the unsupervised setting. This would provide a clearer understanding of the model's generation capabilities.
*   **Dataset Diversity:**  Evaluate USLNet on more diverse datasets to assess its generalizability.
*   **Clarify Sliding Window Aligner:** Provide more intuitive explanations and visual examples for the sliding window aligner, especially the weighting scheme based on the Gaussian distribution. Explain the intuition for choosing those distributions more clearly.
*   **Provide More Implementation Details:** Include more specific details about the architecture and hyperparameters used for the different components of USLNet to improve reproducibility.
*   **Qualitative Analysis:** Include a section showing examples of the input text, generated video and translated text output to help readers better understand where the model performs well and where it fails.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, this is a promising paper that presents a novel and valuable approach to unsupervised sign language translation and generation. The USLNet framework and the proposed sliding window aligner are significant contributions.  Addressing the identified weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements would further strengthen the paper and enhance its impact on the field. I recommend acceptance, pending addressing the points above.
