OUTPUT:
The paper examines the key area of verified adversarial robustness in deep learning. It proposes a novel perspective on training robust networks, focusing on the "expressivity" of the loss function. The central hypothesis is that the ability of a loss function to span a range of trade-offs between adversarial training (empirical robustness) and verified robustness (formal guarantees) is crucial for achieving state-of-the-art performance. The paper supports this hypothesis through theoretical arguments, the definition of "expressive losses," and comprehensive experimental evaluations.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** The concept of "loss expressivity" offers a fresh angle on the challenges in verified training. It moves beyond simply trying to tighten approximations of the worst-case loss and emphasizes the importance of a loss's ability to navigate the accuracy-robustness trade-off. The claim that trivially designed expressive losses can achieve state-of-the-art performance is compelling.
*   **Theoretical Foundation:** The paper provides a clear definition of expressive losses and presents three concrete instances (CC-IBP, MTL-IBP, Exp-IBP) derived from convex combinations. The propositions and proofs demonstrating the expressivity of these losses are well-structured and contribute to the rigor of the work.
*   **Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation:** The experimental section is thorough and convincing. The paper compares the proposed methods against a wide range of existing techniques on multiple datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, TinyImageNet, ImageNet64). The ablation studies, especially the sensitivity analysis to the over-approximation coefficient (α) and the investigation of the relationship between branch-and-bound loss approximation and performance, provide valuable insights. The reproduction of SABR experiments and better results than the original papers confirm the importance of tuning expressivity, and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the arguments and understand the experimental results. The inclusion of pseudo-code and detailed experimental settings enhances reproducibility.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited theoretical analysis of the expressivity:** The definition of expressivity is somewhat intuitive, however, it would be interesting to see how the proposed expressivity definition relates to other concepts in the literature such as the loss landscape of the learned function.
*   **Dependence on IBP:** All three proposed losses rely on IBP as the base verification method. While IBP is computationally efficient, it is known to be a relatively loose bound. The paper would benefit from exploring the use of other, potentially tighter, verification methods within the expressive loss framework.
*   **Lack of Explanation on the success of Exp-IBP:** The study does not go into more detail on the benefits of the Exp-IBP loss which experimentally performs well.
*   **Limited architectural exploration:** All experiments are performed using the CNN7 architecture. It would be better to include results for different architecture as well.
*   **Tuning on the test set:** The experiments tune hyper-parameters on the test set, which can lead to over-fitting. It would be better to tune hyper-parameters on a validation set and then evaluate the models on the test set.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Broader Verification Techniques:** Investigate the impact of using tighter (but potentially more expensive) incomplete verifiers (e.g., linear relaxations, convex hull approximations) within CC-IBP, MTL-IBP, and Exp-IBP. This could reveal whether expressivity remains crucial even with more accurate bounding techniques.
*   **Extend the experiments:** it would be valuable to see this evaluated on different architectures besides the CNN7.
*   **More Theoretical Justification:** Provide a more rigorous theoretical justification for the concept of "loss expressivity." Could this notion be linked to properties of the loss landscape or the optimization dynamics?
*   **Clarify the Role of the Attack:** In the experimental section, delve deeper into the interplay between the adversarial attack used during training and the choice of the over-approximation coefficient (α). Explain the trade-off between a strong attack (leading to better empirical robustness) and a suitable α value for verification.
*   **Discussion of limitations:** The paper should explicitly address the limitations, and include future research directions.
*   **Improve Generalization:** Add a validation split to avoid tuning directly on the test data.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of verified adversarial robustness. The concept of "loss expressivity" provides a valuable new perspective on training robust networks, and the experimental results convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Addressing the suggested improvements could further strengthen the paper.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend this paper for acceptance, contingent on addressing the suggested improvements.
