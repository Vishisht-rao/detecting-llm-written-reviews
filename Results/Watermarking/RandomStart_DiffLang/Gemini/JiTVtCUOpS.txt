OUTPUT:
This article examines an important problem in multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting: how to effectively leverage channel dependence. The paper argues that while recent channel-independent (CI) methods have achieved state-of-the-art results, they miss opportunities to exploit useful lead-lag relationships between variates. The proposed method, LIFT, addresses this by dynamically estimating leading indicators and their leading steps, then allowing lagged variates to use advance information from these indicators. The authors demonstrate strong empirical results on six real-world datasets, showing that LIFT improves state-of-the-art methods significantly.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the review:

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses a Relevant Problem:** The paper tackles a timely and relevant issue in MTS forecasting. The counterintuitive success of CI methods despite the inherent dependence between channels is well-articulated.
*   **Clear Motivation and Intuition:** The paper clearly explains the motivation behind exploiting lead-lag relationships and the challenges in doing so due to their dynamic nature. Figure 1 effectively illustrates the concept.
*   **Novelty of Approach (LIFT):** The proposed LIFT method is novel and well-structured. The three key steps (lead estimation, target-oriented shifts, lead-aware refinement) are logically presented.
*   **Efficient Algorithm:** The paper highlights the efficiency of the cross-correlation computation algorithm, which is crucial for practical applications. The reduction in complexity from O(L^2) to O(LlogL) is significant.
*   **Frequency Domain Refinement:** The use of an adaptive frequency mixer to filter undesirable frequency components is a clever approach, addressing the heterogeneity often found in MTS data.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The extensive experiments on six real-world datasets provide compelling evidence of LIFT's effectiveness. The comparison against state-of-the-art CI and CD models is thorough. The average improvement of 5.4% is significant.
*   **Plug-and-Play Nature:** The plug-and-play nature of LIFT is a major advantage, allowing it to be easily integrated with existing forecasting methods.
*   **Lightweight Method (LightMTS):** The introduction of LightMTS demonstrates the flexibility of LIFT and showcases its effectiveness even with a simple linear backbone. This highlights the importance of the lead-lag relationship modeling.
*   **Ablation Study and Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The ablation study validates the importance of each component of LIFT, and the hyperparameter sensitivity analysis provides practical guidance for users.
*   **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it easy to understand the problem, the proposed solution, and the experimental results.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Failure Cases Analysis:** While the paper showcases strong results, it acknowledges failure cases with datasets like ETTm1 and ETTh1 (small number of variates). Further analysis of *why* LIFT struggles in these scenarios could strengthen the paper. Are there specific characteristics of these datasets that make lead-lag relationships less prominent or more difficult to identify?
*   **Practical Cost:** Table 3 shows the increased computational time. While acceptable for a research paper, this aspect might affect adoption in cost-sensitive environments. A more thorough discussion of where the time is spent could be helpful. It may also be helpful to add a comparision of training time.
*   **ILI Dataset Performance:** The performance reported for the ILI dataset wasn't very impressive, it would have been better to leave this out.
*   **Some terminology could be clarified:** For example "turn(X(i→j)t+1:t+H)" could be clearer.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Investigate Failure Cases:** Conduct a deeper analysis of why LIFT underperforms on datasets with a small number of variates (e.g., ETTm1, ETTh1). Consider adding more diverse datasets to the experiments to demonstrate the generalizability of LIFT.
*   **More Detail on Practical Cost:** Elaborate on the practical implications of the increased computational cost. Identify potential optimizations or trade-offs that could be made to improve efficiency. What proportion of the time is spent on lead estimation vs. lead-aware refinement?
*   **Clarify the choice of K:** While hyperparameter analysis is performed, what is a heuristic one should use when selecting K, the number of leading indicators?
*   **Justify Design Choices:** Deeper justification for specific design choices, such as the architecture of the Adaptive Frequency Mixer and the choice of MSE as the loss function, would further strengthen the paper.
*   **Expand discussion of distribution shifts:** Perhaps even quantify them to better support the argument.

**Overall Assessment:**

This is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach to leveraging channel dependence in MTS forecasting. The LIFT method addresses a relevant problem, is well-motivated and explained, and demonstrates compelling empirical results. While there are a few areas for improvement, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses.  This paper is well-suited for publication at ICLR.
