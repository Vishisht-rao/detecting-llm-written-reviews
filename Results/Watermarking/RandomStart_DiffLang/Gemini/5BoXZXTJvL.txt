**Review of "Beyond Size: How Gradients Shape Pruning Decisions in Large Language Models"**

**Summary:**

The paper introduces GBLM-Pruner, a novel training-free pruning method for large language models (LLMs) that leverages gradients to determine the importance of weights. The method utilizes the first-order term of the Taylor expansion, combined with normalized gradients from calibration samples, to identify weights for pruning. The authors demonstrate that GBLM-Pruner outperforms existing methods like SparseGPT and Wanda on LLaMA-1 and LLaMA-2 across various language benchmarks and perplexity evaluations.  The paper also presents theoretical justification based on the Optimal Brain Surgeon framework and extends the approach to Vision Transformers (ViT).

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty:** The core idea of incorporating gradients into the pruning metric, especially in a training-free manner, is novel and potentially impactful.  The paper clearly articulates the limitations of existing weight/activation-based approaches and positions GBLM-Pruner as a theoretically grounded alternative.
*   **Strong Empirical Results:** The experimental results are compelling.  The paper demonstrates consistent improvements in perplexity and zero-shot task performance compared to strong baselines across multiple LLM sizes (7B to 70B) for both LLaMA-1 and LLaMA-2.  The extension to ViT further strengthens the generalizability claim.
*   **Theoretical Justification:**  The adaptation of the Optimal Brain Surgeon framework to incorporate gradients provides a theoretical basis for the method. This is a significant strength compared to purely heuristic approaches.
*   **Clarity of Writing (Generally):** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, with a clear explanation of the proposed method and its differences from existing techniques. The algorithm description and the explanation of the pruning metric are well-presented.
*   **Reproducibility:** The authors explicitly address reproducibility by stating they will release code and models. This is crucial for the community to validate and build upon their work.

**Weaknesses and Suggestions:**

*   **Clarity on Gradient Normalization:** While the paper mentions "properly normalized gradients," the exact normalization procedure used is not explicitly defined within the main Algorithm 1 or Section 2.2. Please provide a precise definition (e.g., is it L1 or L2 normalization across the calibration samples *before* taking the magnitude? Is it normalized to a specific range?). Adding this detail directly to Algorithm 1 would greatly improve clarity.
*   **Ablation Study Depth:** The ablation study could be strengthened.
    *   **Scaling Factor α:** While Table 6 shows an ablation of alpha, it would be helpful to see *why* 100 is the optimal value. Is there an intuitive explanation related to the relative magnitudes of the gradient and activation terms?
    *   **Component Ablation:** It would be valuable to see an ablation study that isolates the impact of the gradient component versus the activation component in Equation 5. Show results for: 1) weight magnitude only, 2) weight magnitude + activation, 3) weight magnitude + gradient, 4) weight magnitude + gradient + activation. This would more clearly demonstrate the individual contribution of the gradient information.
*   **Practical Considerations:** The paper focuses on zero-shot performance. While valuable, it's important to acknowledge the potential for fine-tuning after pruning. Could GBLM-Pruner be used as a pre-pruning step *before* fine-tuning, and how might its performance compare to other methods in that setting? Briefly discussing this direction would increase the paper's impact.
*   **Visualization:** While Figure 4 shows the pruning pattern, it's difficult to interpret what the patterns *mean*. Could the authors provide some interpretation of the observed structural patterns? For example, do certain rows or columns (corresponding to specific neurons or features) tend to be pruned more frequently? Connecting these patterns to known properties of LLMs would be highly valuable.
*   **Theoretical Connection:** While the OBS framework provides a good starting point, the connection between the derived equation (11) and the final pruning metric (Equation 5) could be strengthened. The step from (11) to suggesting wm * ||xm||2 + |wm| * gm is not clearly motivated. A more detailed explanation of why this specific combination works well would be beneficial. What is the intuition?

**Minor Comments:**

*   The paper mentions both L1 and L2 normalization for gradients, but the tables often only specify "ℓ1". Be consistent in specifying which norm is used in each experiment or comparison.
*   There are a few grammatical errors and typos throughout the paper (e.g., "orweights+activations+weight update"). Proofread carefully.
*   In the Introduction, clarify what is meant by "geometric interdependence inherent in the LLMs’ parameter structure."

**Overall Recommendation:**

This is a promising paper with a novel approach to LLM pruning. The empirical results are strong, and the theoretical justification provides a solid foundation. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above, particularly related to gradient normalization, ablation study depth, and the connection between theory and practice, would significantly strengthen the paper and make it a valuable contribution to the ICLR community.  I am leaning towards acceptance, pending these revisions.
