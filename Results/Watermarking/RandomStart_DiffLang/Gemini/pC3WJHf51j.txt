Here's a review of the ICLR 2024 conference paper "LARGE-SCALE TRAINING OF FOUNDATION MODELS FOR WEARABLE BIOSIGNALS":

**Cet article explore un aspect critique** of modern healthcare: leveraging the vast amounts of unlabeled biosignal data collected by wearable devices. The authors address the significant challenge of limited annotated medical data by training foundation models for PPG and ECG signals using a large-scale dataset from the Apple Heart and Movement Study (AHMS). This approach has the potential to unlock new digital biomarkers and improve personalized health monitoring. The paper is well-written, clearly structured, and presents compelling results.

**Strengths:**

*   **Novelty and Significance:** This work presents a significant contribution by being the first to train foundation models on such a large-scale PPG and ECG dataset collected from consumer wearable devices. Prior work has been limited by smaller, clinically-derived datasets. The potential impact on healthcare is substantial, as it paves the way for more accurate and efficient analysis of wearable sensor data.
*   **Technical Soundness:** The self-supervised learning framework is well-designed and incorporates relevant techniques from other domains, such as computer vision. The use of participant-level positive pair selection, stochastic augmentation, and a regularized InfoNCE loss optimized with momentum training appears appropriate and effective.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The authors perform a thorough evaluation, including linear probing to assess the information encoded in the pre-trained embeddings regarding demographics and health conditions. The ablation studies are particularly valuable for understanding the contribution of individual components of the framework. Comparing their method to SimCLR and BYOL and ablating KoLeo regularization provides additional insight into the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The analysis of the differences between PPG and ECG pre-training is interesting and reveals crucial distinctions between the two modalities.
*   **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The introduction clearly motivates the research, and the methods and results are presented in a clear and organized manner. The use of tables and figures effectively illustrates the key findings. The inclusion of an appendix with supplementary details and implementation information enhances reproducibility. The reproducibility statement is commendable, although limitations regarding data and code sharing are noted.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Generalizability Discussion:** While the study uses a large dataset, it is sourced from the Apple Heart and Movement Study, potentially introducing a bias towards Apple Watch users.  The generalizability of the foundation models to data collected from other wearable devices or populations should be further addressed in the discussion. Could the pre-trained models be easily adapted for use with other biosignal modalities, such as Electrodermal Activity (EDA)?
*   **Downstream Task Specificity:** The linear probing evaluation, while informative, is still relatively simple. Exploring more complex downstream tasks that directly translate into real-world applications, such as early detection of specific medical conditions, would strengthen the paper. The labels for health conditions are self-reported, which introduces potential inaccuracies.
*   **Augmentation Tuning:** While the authors acknowledge that the augmentation module was not comprehensively tuned, a more detailed analysis of the impact of different augmentation strategies, beyond the ablation of single augmentations, would be beneficial. Perhaps exploring adaptive augmentation strategies could further improve performance.
*   **Computational Cost:** While the paper mentions training on A100 GPUs, a more detailed discussion of the computational resources required for pre-training and fine-tuning would be helpful for researchers interested in replicating or extending this work.
*   **Interpretability:** While the embeddings are shown to be predictive of health conditions, the paper provides limited insight into *why* certain embeddings are correlated with specific conditions. Further work on interpreting the learned representations could provide valuable medical insights.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address Generalizability:**  Include a more detailed discussion of the potential biases in the dataset and how they might affect the generalizability of the models. Suggest strategies for mitigating these biases in future work.
*   **Explore More Complex Downstream Tasks:** Evaluate the foundation models on more challenging downstream tasks that directly address real-world clinical applications. Consider using more accurate label data.
*   **Further Augmentation Analysis:** Conduct a more thorough exploration of different augmentation strategies, potentially using adaptive augmentation techniques.
*   **Provide Computational Details:** Include more specific information about the computational resources and training time required for pre-training and fine-tuning the models.
*   **Investigate Interpretability:** Explore techniques for interpreting the learned representations to gain a better understanding of *why* certain embeddings are predictive of specific health conditions.
*   **Future work discussion:** Discuss how the learned embeddings from wearable sensors can be combined with external patient-level information (e.g., medical history, lab results, etc.) to further improve model performance.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that presents a significant advancement in the field of wearable biosignal analysis. The authors have demonstrated the feasibility of training foundation models on large-scale, unlabeled data, opening up new possibilities for personalized health monitoring and early disease detection. Addressing the identified weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements would further enhance the impact of this work. I would recommend accepting this paper for publication at ICLR 2024, with minor revisions to address the points raised above.
