OUTPUT:
Review: The study explores the subject of debiasing vision-language models (VLMs) by addressing dataset biases present in commonly used evaluation datasets like COCO Captions. The paper argues that spurious correlations between background context and gender in these datasets compromise the validity of bias metrics like Bias@K. To overcome this limitation, the authors propose a novel dataset debiasing pipeline that augments COCO with synthetic, gender-balanced contrast sets, where only the gender of the subject is edited while the background remains fixed. The paper also introduces an automatic filtering method based on KNN similarity to real images to enhance the quality of the generated synthetic images. Through benchmarking CLIP-based models on the balanced synthetic contrast sets, the study demonstrates how imbalances in the original COCO dataset skew bias metrics and suggests that the proposed approach contributes to a more realistic understanding of bias in CLIP.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Problem Definition:** The paper clearly articulates the problem of dataset bias and its impact on accurately measuring bias in VLMs. The explanation of spurious correlations in COCO is well-presented and supported by empirical evidence.
*   **Novel Approach:** The proposed synthetic data augmentation pipeline using contrast sets is a novel approach to address the limitations of existing debiasing methods. The use of InstructPix2Pix for controlled image editing and the KNN-based filtering method demonstrate innovative techniques.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed method, including human evaluation, zero-shot classification accuracy, and text-to-image retrieval performance. The comparison with the GENSWAP baseline highlights the importance of effective image editing methods.
*   **Well-Structured and Readable:** The paper is generally well-structured and easy to follow. The introduction clearly outlines the motivation and contributions, and the related works section provides relevant context.
*   **Discussion of Limitations:** The authors acknowledge the limitations of the proposed approach, such as the potential for synthetic shifts, reliance on binary gender labels, and the risk of stacking biases from generative models. This transparency adds credibility to the work.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Synthetic Shift Concerns:** While the authors acknowledge the synthetic shift issue, the potential impact on generalizability to real-world scenarios needs further discussion. How well does the debiased dataset reflect real-world bias, even if it removes spurious correlations?  More analysis on the potential differences between the original and the augmented data in terms of distributions of image features would be helpful.
*   **Binary Gender Assumption:** The reliance on binary gender labels is a significant limitation. While the authors acknowledge this, further exploration of alternative approaches to representing gender beyond binary categories is warranted. Perhaps some discussion of how the method *could* be extended would be useful, even if implementing that is beyond the scope of this paper.
*   **Generative Model Biases:** The potential for biases in the generative model to influence the synthetic data and perpetuate stereotypes is a concern. While the KNN filtering helps, further analysis of the characteristics of the generated data and potential mitigation strategies would strengthen the paper. An analysis of whether the generated images match pre-conceived stereotypes associated with gender (e.g., as measured by a separate stereotype benchmark) would be valuable.
*   **Choice of CLIP Models:** The paper focuses primarily on CLIP models. While these models are relevant, it would be beneficial to evaluate the proposed method on other VLMs to assess its generalizability.
*   **Detailed Explanation of KNN filtering:** The KNN filtering technique is core to the work. A deeper dive into hyperparameter selection, ablation studies on varying parameters, and additional visualization to display the impact of filtering could make the paper stronger. The discussion about selecting the thresholds `τR` and `τG` is limited.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Address Synthetic Shift:** Conduct further analysis to assess the impact of the synthetic shift on the performance of VLMs on real-world tasks. Explore techniques to minimize the distribution gap between synthetic and real data.
*   **Discuss Non-Binary Gender Representation:** Provide a more in-depth discussion of the challenges and potential solutions for representing non-binary gender in the proposed framework.
*   **Mitigate Generative Model Biases:** Implement techniques to reduce the influence of biases in the generative model, such as incorporating fairness constraints or using diverse training data.
*   **Evaluate on a Wider Range of VLMs:** Evaluate the proposed method on other VLMs to assess its generalizability beyond CLIP models.
*   **Elaborate on KNN Filtering Process:** Provide a more detailed explanation of the KNN filtering process, including the rationale behind the chosen parameters and a visualization of the filtering effect. Perhaps a more quantitative breakdown of edits that are rejected vs. accepted could be useful.

**Overall:**

This is a well-written and thought-provoking paper that addresses an important problem in the field of vision-language models. The proposed dataset debiasing pipeline is a novel approach that has the potential to improve the accuracy and reliability of bias measurements. While the paper has some limitations, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. With some revisions to address the concerns raised above, this paper would be a valuable contribution to the ICLR conference.
