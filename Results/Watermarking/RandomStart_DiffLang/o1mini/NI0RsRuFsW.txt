**Review of the Paper: "How Hard Is Trojan Detection in DNNs? Fooling Detectors with Evasive Trojans"**

### Summary of the Paper

This paper addresses a critical challenge in the security of deep neural networks (DNNs): the detection of trojan attacks. The authors propose a novel method for creating evasive trojans that are more difficult for existing detection methods to identify. The work highlights the potential for adversarial attack strategies that are specifically designed to evade a broad range of model-level detectors, a relatively underexplored area in the field. The authors present an experimental framework where they create thousands of trojaned models and evaluate their performance against state-of-the-art detectors, providing significant empirical evidence for their claims.

### Strengths

1. **Relevance and Timeliness**: The issue of trojan attacks in AI systems is highly relevant, especially as DNNs are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications. This paper offers timely insights that could shape future research directions in the field of adversarial machine learning.

2. **Innovative Approach**: The authors introduce several novel techniques (distribution matching loss, specificity loss, and randomization loss) for enhancing the evasiveness of trojans. This multifaceted approach is a notable contribution to the existing literature and adds complexity to the understanding of trojan detection.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The authors conduct extensive experiments with over 6,000 neural networks trained on multiple datasets. This empirical foundation strengthens their claims and provides a thorough validation of their methods.

4. **Surprising Findings**: The unexpected result that evasive trojans are also harder to reverse-engineer is a significant contribution that underlines the complexity of implementing effective defenses against such attacks. This finding could lead to further investigation into the relationship between evasiveness and reverse-engineering difficulty.

5. **Actionable Insights for Defense**: The paper underscores the need for robust monitoring mechanisms to detect hidden functionalities in neural networks, encouraging future research focused on improving detection strategies in light of evolving trojan attack methodologies.

### Weaknesses

1. **Lack of Theoretical Foundation**: While the empirical results are compelling, the paper could benefit from a deeper theoretical analysis of the mechanisms by which the proposed losses enhance evasiveness. Providing a clearer theoretical grounding would strengthen the validity of their approach.

2. **Comparative Analysis with Other Evasion Techniques**: The authors mention several existing methods designed to evade detectors. However, a systematic comparison of their approach with these prior methods would enhance the context of their results and better illustrate the benefits of their innovations.

3. **Limitation of Detectors**: The performance of detectors against various types of trojan attacks, including those not designed to evade model-level detection, is not examined as thoroughly. Greater detail on how different trojan designs – particularly those optimized for evasiveness – perform against traditional detection strategies would provide a more complete landscape of the problem.

4. **Future Work Discussion**: Although the paper touches on the implications of its findings, a more robust discussion on future work could be beneficial. This could include suggestions for specific avenues of research on both offensive and defensive strategies in the context of trojan attacks.

### Conclusion

Overall, "How Hard Is Trojan Detection in DNNs? Fooling Detectors with Evasive Trojans" presents a novel and impactful contribution to the field of neural network security. It highlights an intriguing area of research that promises to enhance the understanding of adversarial attacks in deep learning. While the empirical results are strong, the paper would benefit from a deeper theoretical analysis and comparisons with other work in the field. There is potential for significant implications of this work in both theory and practical applications, and it offers a solid groundwork for future explorations into trojan detection and defenses against it.
