### Review of "FENDA-FL: Personalized Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Clinical Datasets"

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel approach called FENDA-FL, which extends the frustratingly easy neural domain adaptation (FENDA) method to personalized federated learning (FL) in clinical environments. The authors motivate their research by elucidating the challenges faced in clinical data sharing due to strict regulations and the inherent heterogeneity of clinical datasets. The paper proposes a method that allows for the aggregation of global features while retaining the ability for clients to adapt to their unique data distributions. Through experiments conducted on two datasets (FLamby benchmarks and GEMINI clinical data), the authors claim that FENDA-FL outperforms existing global and personalized FL techniques, providing significant improvements over traditional FL approaches.

**Strengths:**
1. **Relevance**: The exploration of federated learning in the clinical domain addresses a critical issue of data silos, making the methods described in the paper highly relevant and timely given the increasing emphasis on data privacy and security in healthcare.

2. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The authors conduct a thorough evaluation of their proposed method against well-established benchmarks, demonstrating improved performance on various tasks, such as heart disease prediction, 3D brain segmentation, and mortality predictions.

3. **Robustness**: The proposed FENDA-FL method shows promise in handling heterogeneous and non-IID data, which is a significant challenge in federated learning. The paper also outlines the method's robustness to distribution shifts, a critical factor for deployment in diverse clinical settings.

4. **Clear Framework**: The authors propose a detailed checkpointing and evaluation framework, aligning federated learning practices more closely with standard machine learning. This is particularly useful for improving the evaluation metrics and reporting standards within the FL community.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity of Methodology**: While the extension of FENDA to FENDA-FL is a novel contribution, the complexity of the approach might deter simplified interpretations of the model's mechanisms. Some readers may struggle to grasp how the integration of global and local feature extractors functions in practice without a more detailed, step-by-step breakdown.

2. **Limited Datasets**: The paper primarily focuses on two dataset collections. Expanding the evaluation to include additional datasets across various clinical environments could provide further validation of the method’s effectiveness and generalizability.

3. **Implementation Details**: Although some hyperparameter tuning is discussed, more detail on the experimentation setup, including how hyperparameters were optimized across different models, would enhance reproducibility. Providing a specific seed for randomness and a more thorough description of data splits would be beneficial.

4. **Discussion on Limitations**: The paper indicates the potential robustness of FENDA-FL against extreme heterogeneity but lacks an extensive discussion on the limitations of the proposed method. Addressing situations where FENDA-FL may underperform compared to other methods would provide a more balanced view of its capabilities.

**Minor Comments:**
- The inclusion of visualization (e.g., Figures 6 and 7) enhances the understanding of results but could be explained further in terms of their significance.
- Ensure consistency in terminology across sections, particularly in describing methods and results, to maintain clarity.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of federated learning, particularly within clinical applications. The proposed FENDA-FL framework demonstrates robust performance in heterogeneous settings and introduces a thoughtful evaluation framework for federated learning approaches. By addressing the weaknesses noted and expanding upon certain areas, the impact of this work could be further amplified. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to enhance clarity and completeness.
