**Review of "Provable Robust Watermarking for AI-Generated Text"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel watermarking method for large language models (LLMs) that aims to address concerns of misuse related to AI-generated text. The proposed method, labeled UNIGRAM-WATERMARK, builds upon the existing framework of K-gram watermarks and introduces a simplification to improve robustness against text edits and paraphrasing attacks. The authors provide a rigorous theoretical framework to assure the performance of their watermark in terms of generation quality, correctness, and robustness, substantiated by extensive experimental evaluations across various models and datasets.

**Strengths:**
1. **Theoretical Foundations:** The paper introduces a strong theoretical framework that defines and quantifies the effectiveness and robustness of the watermarking method. The use of Renyi divergence to measure closeness between the watermarked and original distributions is a solid theoretical choice.
  
2. **Robustness Against Edits:** The authors convincingly demonstrate that the UNIGRAM-WATERMARK method is significantly more resilient to edits compared to existing methods, providing a clear improvement in robustness that is empirically validated with various attack scenarios.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The paper provides extensive experimental results across multiple datasets and LLMs. The performance metrics evaluated, including TPR (True Positive Rate), F1 scores, and perplexity comparisons, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method relative to the baseline methods.

4. **Practical Relevance:** By addressing the pressing issue of watermarking in AI-generated text, the authors contribute meaningfully to the conversation surrounding the ethical use of LLMs, making it relevant to current discussions in AI safety and responsibility.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Assumptions on Language Models:** The robustness of the UNIGRAM-WATERMARK method relies on certain assumptions about the entropy of generated text and homophily. While these are reasonable, the paper could benefit from elaborating on the implications of these assumptions and their potential limitations in practical deployments.

2. **Trade-offs in Watermark Strength:** The trade-offs between watermark strength, generation quality, and detection performance are mentioned but could use more detailed exploration. Analyzing how different settings of watermark parameters affect real-world applications would enhance the paper's practical implications.

3. **Discussion on Limitations:** While the authors acknowledge limitations and future work, a more in-depth discussion regarding potential weaknesses and scenarios where the watermark might fail or be less effective would provide a balanced view of the work's contributions.

4. **Comparative Analysis with Cryptographic Methods:** The paper offers some context regarding cryptographic watermarks, but a deeper engagement comparing and contrasting these two approaches (statistical vs. cryptographic) in terms of applicability, ease of implementation, and robustness against various attacks would enrich the discussion.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper provides a significant advancement in provable watermarking for AI-generated text, contributing both theoretically and practically to the field. With minor additions and clarifications, particularly regarding the assumptions made and the potential limitations, the paper could stand as a strong reference for future work in AI watermarking. The experimental results affirm the method's robustness and effectiveness, making it a valuable asset in the landscape of LLM safety and responsible AI use. I recommend acceptance pending minor revisions to address the mentioned weaknesses.
