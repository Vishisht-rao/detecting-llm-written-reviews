### Review of "ACHIEVING CERTIFIED ROBUSTNESS AND MAINTAINING CLEAN ACCURACY VIA VANILLA MODEL GUIDE"

#### Summary
The paper presents a novel approach called Duet, which aims to enhance certified robustness in deep neural networks (DNNs) while maintaining high clean accuracy. The authors argue that traditional certified robust training methods often result in a significant drop in clean accuracy due to heavy regularization. To address this issue, they propose using a pre-trained vanilla model as a guide, applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to its weight matrices to facilitate knowledge transfer to a certification model. The experimental results demonstrate that Duet can yield improvements in clean accuracy while only marginally reducing certified accuracy compared to existing methodologies.

#### Strengths
1. **Innovative Approach**: The use of a pre-trained vanilla model as a guide for transferring knowledge to achieve both certified robustness and clean accuracy is a fresh perspective that addresses a critical challenge in robust neural network training.

2. **Reduction of Clean Accuracy Loss**: The results reported indicate a promising improvement in clean accuracy (3.76%) with only a slight decrease in certified accuracy (-0.93%). This is a noteworthy achievement in a field where there is often a trade-off between these two metrics.

3. **Use of SVD**: The application of SVD provides an effective mechanism to derive useful rotation matrices that help preserve the performance of the certification model. This mathematical foundation adds rigor to the proposed method.

4. **Detailed Experimental Setup**: The paper includes a comprehensive experimental setup with relevant comparisons against existing methods, providing a solid evaluation of the proposed approach. The use of relevant datasets and the reported computational costs add practical value to the findings.

5. **Scalability Considerations**: The authors discuss the computational cost and memory requirements of their method, illustrating advantages over more traditional methods, which is crucial for real-world applications.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Conceptual Clarity**: While the proposed method is intriguing, the explanation of how exactly rotation matrix similarity translates into improved clean accuracy could benefit from further elaboration. The current description may be challenging for some readers to grasp fully.

2. **Theoretical Justifications**: The paper lacks in-depth theoretical analyses justifying why the combination of SVD and knowledge transfer using rotation matrices leads to maintained accuracy. Additional theoretical backing could strengthen the arguments presented.

3. **Potential Overfitting**: There is limited exploration of the generalization capabilities of the Duet method across different datasets beyond CIFAR-10. More extensive benchmarking against varied datasets could provide stronger evidence of its applicability.

4. **Performance Metrics**: While the improvement in performance metrics is noted, including additional metrics such as training time convergence or robustness under different adversarial scenarios would further enrich the evaluation.

5. **Comparative Analysis**: The paper predominantly compares against a few well-known methods. Including more recent techniques that have shown competitive results in the realm of certified robustness would present a more comprehensive landscape of the methodological advancements in this area.

#### Conclusion
Overall, this paper presents a significant advancement in the pursuit of achieving both certified robustness and clean accuracy in DNNs. The introduction of the Duet method is innovative, and the experimental results support its efficacy. However, it would benefit from clearer explanations, stronger theoretical foundations, and broader evaluation across different domains. Provided these weaknesses are addressed, the contributions of this work could make a substantial impact on future research in the intersection of adversarial robustness and model performance. The paper is suitable for presentation at ICLR 2024, provided minor revisions are made to address the outlined concerns.
