OUTPUT:
The manuscript focuses on the topic of exploration in sparse-reward reinforcement learning (RL) through a novel method of skill generation, which is framed as tokenization using subword techniques common in natural language processing (NLP). By introducing a method termed "Subwords as Skills" (SaS), the authors propose a dual-component approach that discretizes the action space and leverages tokenization methods to generate temporally extended actions, thereby enhancing the exploration capabilities of RL agents.

### Strengths:
1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The introduction of subword tokenization from NLP into the context of reinforcement learning presents an interesting and innovative perspective. Given the well-documented challenges of exploration in sparse-reward environments, this approach addresses a significant gap by proposing a more efficient way to form skills without extensive pretraining.

2. **Computation Efficiency**: The authors demonstrate that their method significantly speeds up skill generation compared to existing methods, with empirical results suggesting orders-of-magnitude improvements in generation time. This efficiency is crucial for practical applications where computational resources may be limited.

3. **Empirical Validation**: The experimental results presented in the paper provide robust evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed method across multiple challenging domains. The authors successfully outperform traditional skill-based approaches in several environments, which bolsters the claims made regarding the efficacy of SaS.

4. **Interpretability**: The discrete nature of the skills obtained offers better interpretability, as one can visualize the generated skills and understand their corresponding actions within the context of the tasks.

5. **Exploration Visualizations**: The inclusion of visualizations demonstrating state visitation patterns for different methods strengthens the manuscript by showcasing the tangible benefits of improved exploration behavior as a result of the proposed skill generation method.

### Weaknesses:
1. **Dependency on Action Space Discretization**: While the paper makes strong claims regarding the effectiveness of discretizing action spaces, the authors acknowledge in their limitations that this process could lead to a loss of resolution, particularly in high-dimensional action spaces or in tasks requiring fast and precise movements. The exploration of how varying cluster sizes affect outcomes could be addressed in greater depth.

2. **Unconditional Skills**: The authors' decision to utilize unconditional skills raises questions regarding the deployment of these skills in varied environments, especially if the skills are obtained from suboptimal demonstrations. While this approach may yield competitive results, it could potentially lead to inefficient exploration in scenarios where context-specific skills are advantageous.

3. **Comparative Analysis with Conditional Skills**: Although a comparison with observation-conditioned skills is presented, further exploration into the trade-offs between unconditional and conditional approaches would enhance the analysis. An in-depth discussion regarding when to prefer one methodology over the other could provide valuable insights for future research.

4. **Clarification of Metrics**: While the paper utilizes several performance metrics, some could benefit from clearer exposition. For example, more context or explanation regarding the significance of the standard deviations in the results would aid readers in understanding variability across different seeds.

5. **Limitations and Future Work**: The limitations outlined primarily focus on issues related to action discretization and generalization from demonstrations. A more comprehensive discussion on potential future works or modifications to the method that could mitigate these limitations would provide a clearer pathway for continued research in this area.

### Conclusion:
Overall, the paper presents a compelling and innovative approach to addressing the exploration challenges inherent in sparse-reward reinforcement learning through the lens of subword tokenization. Its contributions offer significant potential for advancing the state-of-the-art in RL while opening avenues for future research. However, addressing the outlined weaknesses could further elevate the work and its applicability across various task domains.
