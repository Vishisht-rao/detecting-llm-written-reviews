**Review of "CROSS-MODALITY DEBIASING: USING LANGUAGE TO MITIGATE SUB-POPULATION SHIFTS IN IMAGING"**

The paper presents a novel approach called Language-based Distributional Robustness Optimization (L-DRO) aimed at addressing sub-population shifts in vision-language models, particularly in the context of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model. The authors propose to leverage natural language as a way to reshape the feature representations of images to mitigate bias introduced by sub-population shifts. This is a relevant and critical problem in machine learning, particularly in scenarios involving diverse demographic groups where models trained on one population may perform poorly on others.

### Strengths:

1. **Relevance of the Problem:**
   The identification and mitigation of algorithmic bias due to sub-population shifts is a timely and important issue in machine learning. The paper contextualizes this problem in the setting of multimodal models like CLIP, making it a worthwhile contribution to an area that is garnering increasing attention in the community.

2. **Innovative Approach:**
   The proposed method, L-DRO, cleverly utilizes the inherent strengths of natural language to inform and adjust the image representations in a way that is both principled and practical. The connection drawn between natural language supervision and robustness to subgroup shifts opens new avenues for research and application.

3. **Empirical Validation:**
   The extensive empirical studies provided support the claims made by the authors. The results demonstrate significant improvements in worst-case performance as well as stability across training epochs, which are promising indicators of the method's effectiveness.

4. **Detailed Experimental Design:**
   The paper includes thorough experimentation with different architectures and datasets (CelebA and Waterbirds), providing a robust analysis of how different configurations of text prompts impact both average and worst-case accuracy. The clarity of the results supports the reproducibility of the experiments.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Complexity of Text Prompt Selection:**
   A significant limitation noted by the authors is the dependence on the selection of text prompts for both classification and debiasing purposes. This aspect may hinder the practical implementation of L-DRO in real-world scenarios where careful prompt engineering can be challenging. The paper could benefit from a more detailed exploration of best practices for prompt selection and potential automated methods for prompt tuning.

2. **Limitation in Diversity of Datasets:**
   While the focus on CelebA and Waterbirds provides a concrete evaluation, it would enhance the contribution to explore a broader range of datasets that reflect various types of sub-population shifts and biases. This would demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed method further.

3. **Lack of Theoretical Insights:**
   The paper primarily focuses on empirical results. Although it provides some theoretical underpinnings related to the L-DRO method, a more in-depth theoretical analysis regarding why the proposed changes in methodology improve robustness could help solidify the contribution to the understanding of model robustness.

4. **Comparison with More Baselines:**
   While the authors compare their method against existing techniques (like DRO variants), a broader comparison against state-of-the-art techniques would provide more insight into how L-DRO stands in relation to other contemporary methodologiesfor addressing sub-population shifts.

### Conclusion:

Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of machine learning by addressing an important issue of sub-population shifts within the context of multimodal models. The innovative use of language for debiasing image representations provides both a novel perspective and a practical solution that warrants further exploration. While the empirical findings are strong, addressing the highlighted weaknesses—especially around prompt selection and broader validation—could enhance the robustness and applicability of the proposed approach. I recommend publication, with minor revisions to address the aforementioned points.
