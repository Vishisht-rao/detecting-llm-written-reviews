**Review of "System Identification of Neural Systems: Going Beyond Images to Modelling Dynamics"**

**Summary:**
The paper proposes a novel framework for the system identification of neural systems by investigating how different deep learning architectures—specifically focusing on video understanding models—correspond to biological neural processing as observed in the human visual cortex. The authors emphasize the significance of incorporating time and motion dynamics, which are often neglected in previous research comparing neural networks to biological systems. The study is structured into both real and simulated experimental setups that facilitate a large-scale comparison of over 30 models including convolutional and transformer-based architectures in the context of single vs. video stimulus processing.

**Strengths:**

1. **Timely and Relevant Topic:** The manuscript addresses a crucial gap in the literature regarding the modeling of dynamics in deep neural networks and their relation to biological neural systems, particularly the visual cortex. Understanding these relationships is pivotal for advancing both AI interpretations and neuroscience.

2. **Robust Methodology:** The authors offer a solid experimental design that includes both simulated environments (targeting artificial networks) and real environments (targeting biological responses). The inclusion of statistical methods, such as Welch’s t-test to establish the significance of results, enhances the reliability of their findings.

3. **Comprehensive Comparison:** By analyzing more than 30 different models with a focus on various architectures and training methodologies (self-supervised vs. fully supervised), the authors provide a detailed and thorough examination of how these models perform. This large-scale comparison is unprecedented in this context.

4. **Insights Into Dynamics Modelling:** The paper successfully demonstrates that dynamics modeling is essential when comparing deep networks to biological responses. The results indicate that video understanding models generally outperform image-based models in reproducing fMRI responses, providing new insights into the functional similarity between neural networks and biological brains.

5. **Clear Contributions:** The contributions are well articulated; the authors not only address the existing gaps but also propose enhancements in encoding techniques to better capture the hierarchical nature of neural networks.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity of Results Presentation:** While the paper covers an impressive breadth of experiments, the presentation of results could be overwhelming. This complexity might obscure key insights for some readers. Simplifying some sections or providing clearer visual summaries could improve accessibility.

2. **Limited Discussion of Implications:** Although the study presents substantial empirical findings, the discussion section could delve deeper into the broader implications of these findings for both AI development and neuroscience. For instance, how might these insights influence the design of future neural network architectures? 

3. **Assumptions in Encoding Model:** The approach to using a weighted neural encoding scheme is innovative; however, the assumptions underpinning this model, particularly regarding the hierarchical mapping of features to brain regions, should be more thoroughly explored. Addressing potential limitations or alternative models could enhance the robustness of the claims made.

4. **Potential Over-reliance on Statistical Metrics:** The paper relies heavily on Pearson's correlation coefficients as a primary evaluative metric. While this is standard practice, additional metrics (e.g., explainability aspects of the models, or qualitative behavioral insights) could provide a more well-rounded assessment of model efficacy in relation to biological understanding.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper makes significant contributions to the understanding of how deep learning architectures can be aligned with biological processes in the brain. It advances the field of neuroscience and artificial intelligence by highlighting the importance of dynamics in modeling neural systems. With some revisions for clarity and depth in certain discussions, this work has the potential to be a valuable reference for researchers aiming to bridge the gap between computational models and biological understanding. The findings underscore a promising direction for future studies in both neural encoding and AI model development.
