### Review of "Online Stabilization of Spiking Neural Networks"

This study addresses a critical topic in the field of artificial intelligence and neuroscience—the training of spiking neural networks (SNNs). By proposing novel methodologies for online training, the authors tackle the inherent challenges of memory efficiency and biological plausibility in SNNs, which are of utmost relevance given the growing interest in energy-efficient neural computing inspired by biological processes.

#### Strengths:

1. **Relevance and Importance**: The topic is of significant interest due to the increasing demand for energy-efficient machine learning models that mimic biological systems. As SNNs offer many advantages over traditional ANNs, the focus on effective training methods is timely and necessary.

2. **Innovation in Methodology**: The introduction of Online Spiking Renormalization (OSR) and Online Threshold Stabilizer (OTS) illustrates a commendable integration of leftover concepts from traditional normalization (like Batch Normalization) into the unique challenges presented by SNNs. The proposed solutions successfully address the limitations of existing online training methods, providing a valuable contribution to the field.

3. **Thorough Experimental Validation**: The authors support their claims with rigorous experiments across multiple datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, DVS-Gesture, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet) and demonstrate that their methods outperform other online training algorithms and traditional approaches (like BPTT) in terms of accuracy while also maintaining lower memory consumption.

4. **Consistent Presentation and Clear Structure**: The manuscript is well-organized, making it easy to navigate through the findings, methodology, and supporting theoretical analysis. The inclusion of detailed algorithms enhances the clarity of the proposed techniques.

5. **Theoretical Analysis**: The paper presents a thoughtful theoretical analysis that provides insight into how the proposed methods influence neuron firing rates and variances throughout the training process. This depth of analysis is commendable and enriches the reader's understanding of the mechanisms at play.

#### Weaknesses:

1. **Performance Compared to BPTT**: While the authors highlight that their methods achieve state-of-the-art performance among online training algorithms, it’s noted that they still do not match the performance of BPTT approaches. The authors mention this limitation but could benefit from a more substantial discussion regarding potential pathways to closer performance parity or how ongoing research might bridge this gap.

2. **Biological Plausibility of Methods**: The paper claims that increased biological plausibility is a driving factor for the proposed methods. Still, the authors should elaborate on how the adjusted mechanisms (OSR and OTS) truly reflect biological processes or how they could be adapted further to mimic biological learning more closely.

3. **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters**: The sensitivity of OSR to hyperparameter choices, especially concerning weight decay, is mentioned. It would be beneficial for the authors to delve deeper into strategies for addressing this sensitivity and ensuring stability across different configurations, which can be critical for adoption in practical applications.

4. **Future Work and Applications**: The concluding remarks could expand on future work beyond addressing the highlighted challenges, including potential real-world applications of their methodology, integration in neuromorphic hardware, and its implications for both biological research and artificial intelligence.

#### Conclusion:

In summary, this paper presents valuable contributions to the area of online training of spiking neural networks through innovative methodologies and robust experimental results. With some improvements in elaborating on the limitations and future directions, the work has the potential for significant impact in both the fields of machine learning and computational neuroscience. I recommend this work for acceptance to the ICLR conference, as it advances our understanding and capabilities in efficient SNN training.
