**Review of "ROBUST NAS UNDER ADVERSARIAL TRAINING: BENCHMARK, THEORY, AND BEYOND"**

**Overview:**
The paper presented by Wu et al. addresses critical issues in the field of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) by focusing on the robustness of architectures against adversarial examples. They identify a significant gap in existing benchmark evaluations and theoretical foundations for NAS in the context of adversarial training. Through the introduction of the NAS-RobBench-201 benchmark, the authors provide a comprehensive dataset to evaluate the performance of neural architectures under adversarial training. Additionally, they establish a theoretical framework leveraging the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) to provide generalization guarantees for robust architectures.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Contribution:**
   The proposal of a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating the robustness of architectures in the context of adversarial attacks is a highly relevant and significant contribution to the field. This work addresses the pressing need for standardized evaluations that consider adversarially trained models, which can accelerate research in robust NAS algorithms.

2. **Thorough Benchmarking:**
   The authors provide detailed statistics and evaluation metrics for a vast array of architectures (6,466) across multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-16-120). This comprehensive approach facilitates reliable reproducibility and efficient assessment of different NAS algorithms, enhancing the credibility of the findings.

3. **Terrestrial Theoretical Insights:**
   The establishment of a generalization theory that incorporates both clean and robust accuracy under adversarial training enriches the existing literature. By using NTK concepts, the paper provides a solid theoretical foundation to guide future robust NAS approaches. 

4. **Practical Implications:**
   The insights gained from their correlation analyses between architectures selected based on clean accuracy versus robust accuracy present practical implications for practitioners, hinting at the nuances of architecture evaluation in adversarial contexts.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Scope of Neural Architectures:**
   One notable limitation is the exclusive focus on Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The paper acknowledges the lack of exploration into state-of-the-art architectures such as vision Transformers, which are increasingly prevalent in the field. Future work expanding the theoretical framework to include these architectures would be beneficial.

2. **Heavy Computational Demand:**
   The authors mention that the construction of the benchmark required approximately 107,000 GPU hours, which raises concerns regarding the environmental impacts of such large-scale evaluations. The discussion of the associated carbon footprint is commendable, yet practical mitigation strategies could have been presented.

3. **Theoretical Generalization under NTK is Limited:**
   While the NTK framework boasted for its theoretical guarantees is beneficial, the paper does not address the potential limitations of the NTK assumptions in real-world settings, such as non-linearities encountered during training processes. This could weaken the applicability of their results to deeper architectures outside the linear regime.

4. **Lack of Comparisons with More NAS Approaches:**
   While the authors compare their proposed NAS-RobBench-201 with previous benchmarks, additional comparisons with state-of-the-art models in adversarial settings could provide a clearer picture of its utility and performance benefits.

**Conclusion:**
The paper "ROBUST NAS UNDER ADVERSARIAL TRAINING: BENCHMARK, THEORY, AND BEYOND" makes significant strides in addressing an overlooked aspect of neural architecture search: model robustness in adversarial conditions. With its novel benchmark and robust theoretical insights, it has the potential to greatly influence research in the NAS community. However, expanded scope, particularly in theoretical analysis, exploration of diverse architecture types, and consideration of environmental concerns could further solidify its impact. Overall, I recommend this paper for acceptance, particularly due to its contributions to advancing both empirical and theoretical methodology in a crucial area of machine learning.
