**Review of "Balancing Act: Constraining Disparate Impact in Sparse Models"**

**Summary:**
The paper addresses the issue of disparate impact in model pruning—a common strategy in machine learning that reduces model size and complexity while aiming to maintain performance. The authors propose a constrained optimization approach called Constrained Excess Accuracy Gaps (CEAG) which directly targets the accuracy discrepancies between dense and sparse models across different sub-groups. This methodology is notable for its interpretability, scalability, and minimal computational overhead. The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, particularly in maintaining fairness across various protected sub-groups.

**Strengths:**
1. **Relevant and Timely Topic:** The focus on mitigating disparate impact in pruned models is critically relevant given the ethical implications of biased AI systems, particularly in sensitive applications such as facial recognition and decision-making systems.
   
2. **Innovative Approach:** CEAG presents a novel approach by constraining per-group accuracy gaps rather than relying on surrogate metrics like loss. This is a logical advancement that could enhance model interpretability and fairness outcomes.

3. **Scalability and Efficiency:** The introduction of proxy constraints and the use of replay buffers allows the method to scale effectively to problems involving numerous protected groups without prohibitive computational costs. This is a substantial improvement compared to previous methods.

4. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The paper provides thorough experimental evaluations demonstrating the effectiveness of CEAG across multiple datasets (FairFace, UTKFace, and CIFAR-100) and neuron network architectures. These results convincingly support the claims made about the method’s performance.

5. **Ethical Considerations:** The authors thoughtfully discuss ethical concerns surrounding facial recognition and fairness, acknowledging the complexities involved in deploying models that make decisions based on sensitive attributes.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Generalization Issues:** While the authors acknowledge that all methods, including CEAG, struggle with generalization on unseen data, a deeper analysis or exploration of potential remedies for these generalization challenges would strengthen the paper.

2. **Statistical Analysis of Results:** Although the paper presents averages and standard deviations for the results, further statistical analysis could offer more insights into the significance of the findings. A thorough exploration of variance across different runs could enhance the robustness of the conclusions.

3. **Discussion of Limitations:** The paper touches on the flexibility of the tolerance parameter (ϵ) but could benefit from a more detailed exploration of how different settings of this parameter affect outcomes in practice.

4. **Reproducibility:** While a link to the code is provided, a more detailed description of the experimental setup, including dependencies and the environment needed to replicate results, would add value for the community.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, “Balancing Act: Constraining Disparate Impact in Sparse Models” contributes valuable insights into the field of machine learning, particularly related to issues of fairness in pruned models. The proposed methodology is commendable for its innovative approach and practical applicability. However, addressing the noted weaknesses, especially the generalization issue and statistical analysis, could further solidify the paper's contributions. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to enhance clarity and depth in certain sections.
