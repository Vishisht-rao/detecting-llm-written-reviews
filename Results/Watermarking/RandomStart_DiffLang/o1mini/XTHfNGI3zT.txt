**Review of "Quantifying the Plausibility of Context Reliance in Neural Machine Translation"**

**Overview:**
The paper presents a novel interpretability framework called Plausibility Evaluation of Context Reliance (PEC ORE) to assess how well neural language models (specifically in the context of machine translation, MT) utilize contextual information in a way that aligns with human intuition. The authors identify a notable gap in the existing literature, which often handles the identification of context-sensitive tokens and the evaluation of their plausibility as separate tasks. PEC ORE aims to bridge this gap by providing an end-to-end framework that can quantify context usage plausibility.

**Strengths:**

1. **Comprehensive Framework:** The introduction of PEC ORE is a significant contribution to the field of NLP interpretability. The framework’s two-step process (Context-sensitive Token Identification and Contextual Cues Imputation) is well-structured and addresses existing limitations in evaluating context reliance.

2. **Methodological Rigor:** The authors provide a robust formalization of their method, detailing how context-sensitive tokens and their corresponding cues are identified and attributed. This thoroughness adds to the reproducibility and usability of the approach.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:** The paper effectively compares PEC ORE against several existing attribution methods and context sensitivity metrics. The results indicate that PEC ORE can reliably capture context usage in MT models, and the evaluation on various datasets increases the credibility of the findings.

4. **Real-World Applicability:** By focusing on actual translations and reducing reliance on artificial benchmarks, the framework strengthens its applicability to real-world machine translation systems and other language generation tasks.

5. **Use of Unannotated Data:** The ability of PEC ORE to evaluate model outputs without requiring human annotations opens up opportunities for wider applicability in various linguistic contexts, which is a critical advancement.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity of Implementation:** While the framework is well-defined, the implementation may be complex, particularly for those not well-versed in NLP interpretability techniques. The paper could benefit from additional practical examples or case studies demonstrating simplified steps for applying PEC ORE.

2. **Limited Scope of Datasets:** The paper focuses primarily on English-French translations and specific discourse phenomena. While this focus allows for thorough analysis, the findings’ generalizability might be limited when applied to other languages or more diverse discourse contexts.

3. **Evaluation Metrics:** While the paper discusses the plausibility of context reliance, further exploration into how these metrics may vary across different model architectures could provide additional insights. The authors might want to contextualize the findings against a broader array of model classes beyond MT to enhance their contributions.

4. **Qualitative Insights:** Although quantitative evaluations are beneficial, qualitative analyses of the identified cue-target pairs could yield deeper insights into the nature of the context reliance issues present in MT models, enhancing the discussion section's richness.

**Conclusion:**
The paper presents a coherent and innovative framework for understanding context reliance in machine translation, addressing important gaps in existing research. By combining rigorous methodology with practical insights into language model behavior, the paper provides a valuable resource for both researchers and practitioners in the NLP field. With a few refinements regarding implementation and broadening its scope, the framework can have a lasting impact on how context is interpreted in language generation tasks. Overall, this work is a significant contribution to the areas of NLP interpretability and machine translation.

**Recommendation:**
I recommend the paper for acceptance at the ICLR 2024 conference, with suggestions for minor revisions to enhance clarity and broaden the scope of the analysis.
