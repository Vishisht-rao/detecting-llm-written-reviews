### Review of "Dynamic Continuous Hyperparameter Tuning for Generalized Linear Contextual Bandits"

#### Summary
The paper proposes a novel framework named Continuous Dynamic Tuning (CDT) designed for online hyperparameter tuning in contextual bandit algorithms. The authors highlight the importance of hyperparameter optimization to minimize cumulative regret and address the limitations of existing offline tuning methods. To this end, they introduce a double-layer bandit framework and specifically develop an adaptive algorithm called Zooming TS with Restarts to facilitate hyperparameter tuning in a continuous search space. The theoretical contributions include a regret analysis under the non-stationary Lipschitz framework, with promising performance highlighted through experiments on both synthetic and real datasets.

#### Strengths
1. **Innovative Approach**: The proposal of a continuous hyperparameter tuning framework in contextual bandits is novel and caters to a significant gap in the literature where most methods rely on discrete candidate sets. This continuous approach can theoretically and practically improve performance in dynamic environments.

2. **Theoretical Contributions**: The paper offers a rigorous formulation of the problem as a non-stationary Lipschitz continuum-armed bandit, providing theoretical guarantees on regret minimization. The introduction of the Zooming TS algorithm with restarts reflects careful consideration of practical challenges in hyperparameter tuning.

3. **Empirical Validation**: The authors conduct extensive experiments across various generalized linear bandits (GLBs) and datasets, showcasing the robust performance of their framework compared to existing methods. This empirical evidence strengthens the claims made in the theoretical sections.

4. **Clarity and Structure**: The organization of the paper is clear, with a well-structured introduction and a logical progression through related works, methodology, and results. The notation and definitions provided are rigorous and facilitate understanding.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Complexity of the Approach**: While the continuous search space is innovative, the algorithm's complexity might inhibit practical deployment. The algorithm’s adaptive strategy, which combines different techniques, may increase the burden on practitioners who require user-friendly implementations.

2. **Limited Generalization of Results**: The applicability of the proposed CDT framework to a wider variety of bandit scenarios or hyperparameter settings is not adequately explored. While the experiments demonstrate improvement over specific algorithms, the generalizability of these findings remains uncertain; additional examples from diverse bandits could bolster these claims.

3. **Sensitivity to Hyperparameter Settings**: The framework’s dependency on parameters such as epoch size H raises concerns about sensitivity. In practice, incorrectly setting these parameters could lead to suboptimal performance. Though the authors suggest practical values based on theoretical findings, clear guidelines would help practitioners make informed decisions.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: The paper lacks a thorough comparative analysis of CDT against more recent hyperparameter tuning methods outside the presented baseline. Including state-of-the-art algorithms used in practice would provide a richer context and validate the claimed superiority over a broader set of competitors.

#### Conclusion
The paper presents a strong contribution to the field of contextual bandits through the introduction of the CDT framework for continuous hyperparameter tuning. The theoretical advancements and empirical results are compelling, showcasing the potential of the proposed methods. However, some weaknesses regarding complexity, sensitivity, and generalization should be addressed in future iterations. Overall, the work is a valuable addition to the literature on online learning and bandit algorithms, with the promise of improving real-world applications in adaptive learning systems. 

I recommend acceptance conditional upon addressing the concerns outlined above.
