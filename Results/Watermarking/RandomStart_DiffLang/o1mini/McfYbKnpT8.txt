**Review of "L2P-MIP: Learning to Presolve for Mixed Integer Programming"**

**Overview:**
The paper proposes a novel approach called Learning to Presolve (L2P) aimed at enhancing Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) solvers by adapting the presolving phase to be instance-specific rather than relying on default, instance-agnostic settings. This method incorporates a combination of supervised learning to predict optimal presolving parameters based on the characteristics of the input instances and utilizes simulated annealing to search for the best presolving configurations. 

**Significance:**
The shift from default presolving to instance-specific approaches addresses a significant area of improvement within MIP solvers. The paper convincingly argues that tailored presolving can lead to substantial reductions in solving time, thereby making MIP solvers more effective, especially given their NP-hard nature. By integrating machine learning techniques with traditional heuristics, this work contributes to the growing intersection of artificial intelligence and operational research.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach:** The hybrid framework combining neural networks with simulated annealing is well-conceived, leveraging the strengths of both heuristic and learning-based methods. 
2. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The authors provide extensive empirical validation on multiple datasets—including easy, medium, hard, and industrial benchmarks—demonstrating that L2P significantly improves solving times and performance metrics compared to traditional approaches.
3. **Focus on Real-world Applications:** The paper addresses practical challenges faced in deploying MIP solvers, recognizing the need to adapt presolving techniques for real-world instances that may differ considerably from standard test cases.
4. **Open-Source Contribution:** The authors have made their implementation publicly available on GitHub, promoting further exploration and validation within the research community.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity and Overhead:** While the integration of learning techniques has shown promising results, the additional layer of complexity may introduce overhead, especially during the training phase. The paper lacks a detailed discussion regarding the trade-offs between the time invested in training the model versus the benefits gained during inference.
2. **Instance Variety and Generalization:** Although the experiments cover a range of datasets, further validation on a broader spectrum of MIP instances, particularly those that deviate from the datasets used, would strengthen the claims of generalizability. 
3. **Comparative Analysis:** While L2P shows improvements over baseline methods, a more rigorous comparative analysis with other contemporary learning-based approaches could provide clearer context on its relative effectiveness.

**Conclusion:**
The paper makes a valuable contribution by proposing and validating the L2P framework, which offers a fresh perspective on improving presolving techniques for mixed integer programming using machine learning. Despite some concerns regarding complexity and generalization, the overall findings are compelling and suggest that there remains considerable potential for future work in this area. This work lays the groundwork for next steps in refining and testing adaptive algorithms in broader operational contexts. Overall, I recommend acceptance of the paper for presentation at the conference.
