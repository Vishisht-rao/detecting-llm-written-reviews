### Review of the Paper "EVOLMPNN: Predicting Mutational Effect on Homologous Proteins by Evolution Encoding"

#### Summary
The paper proposes EVOLMPNN, an Evolution-aware Message Passing Neural Network, designed to predict the effects of mutations on homologous proteins. The authors highlight the limitations of current protein property prediction methods, particularly their insensitivity to subtle mutations. By integrating evolutionary information into a message-passing framework, EVOLMPNN aims to enhance the prediction accuracy and reduce computational costs compared to large pre-trained models.

#### Strengths
1. **Innovative Approach**: The paper presents a novel technique for protein property prediction that effectively combines sequence and evolutionary information. The methodology of embedding evolutionary information via a sample of anchor proteins is particularly innovative.

2. **Performance Gains**: The empirical results demonstrate that EVOLMPNN outperforms existing state-of-the-art models by up to 6.7% in terms of Spearman’s ρ correlation, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed approach in capturing subtle yet crucial differences among homologous proteins.

3. **Computational Efficiency**: The reported 36 times speedup in inference time compared to large pre-trained models is significant, indicating that the proposed model is not only effective but also efficient.

4. **Thorough Experimental Evaluation**: The authors validate their approach on three benchmark datasets with comprehensive splits, including various splits tailored for protein engineering tasks. This adds robustness to their findings and ensures generalization across different scenarios.

5. **Clear Theoretical Foundations**: The theoretical analysis regarding the anchor selection and distortion guarantees provides credibility to the model's design and assures efficiency.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Complexity in Model Explanation**: While the framework is well-defined, the intricacy of the proposed architecture may pose challenges in understanding and replicating the method. A more intuitive breakdown of the stages in their algorithm could help readers less familiar with deep learning or protein modeling.

2. **Dependence on Pre-Training**: The reliance on parameter-frozen pre-trained models for initial embeddings may limit the flexibility and adaptability of EVOLMPNN. Exploring fine-tuning these models alongside the proposed method could further enhance performance.

3. **Potential Overfitting**: While experiments display high performance across different splits, there is a risk of overfitting, particularly on smaller datasets. Further validation on larger or more diverse datasets is needed to ensure the generalizability of the model.

4. **Information from 3D Structures**: The authors specify that they do not incorporate any 3D structural information, which limits the model's ability to fully leverage all available biological data. Future work should consider integrating structural biology concepts to enrich the embeddings further.

5. **Limited Comparisons with Latest Models**: While the paper compares EVOLMPNN with baseline models, it could benefit from including more recent or advanced models in the comparison to depict the competitive landscape of protein engineering methodologies accurately.

#### Suggestions for Improvement
- **Clarify Architectural Complexity**: Provide simpler visual aids or diagrams that illustrate the workflow of EVOLMPNN. This will help in making the architecture more accessible to a broader audience.

- **Explore Tuning Mechanisms**: Investigate how fine-tuning of the PLM models can be integrated into EVOLMPNN. This could potentially enhance performance, particularly on datasets where the protein sequences differ significantly from the pre-training data.

- **Include Additional Datasets**: To enhance the robustness of the results, additional datasets with diverse protein sequences or properties could be included in future evaluations.

- **Expand on Methodological Insights**: While the empirical results are compelling, more qualitative insights into the models’ failures and successes, particularly in cases with high mutation counts, would provide deeper understanding and practical implications for biologists.

#### Conclusion
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of computational biology and protein engineering. The innovative approach presented through EVOLMPNN offers a promising direction for accurately predicting the effects of mutations on homologous proteins. Addressing the suggested weaknesses will enhance the model's applicability and robustness, making it an even more valuable tool for researchers in protein engineering and related fields.
