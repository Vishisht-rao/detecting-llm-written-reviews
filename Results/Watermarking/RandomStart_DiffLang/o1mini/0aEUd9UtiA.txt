## Review of "DiffCPS: Diffusion-based Constrained Policy Search for Offline Reinforcement Learning"

### Summary

The paper presents a novel approach for constrained policy search (CPS) in the context of offline reinforcement learning (RL) through a method termed Diffusion-based Constrained Policy Search (DiffCPS). The authors argue that traditional CPS methods, which primarily rely on Advantage Weighted Regression (AWR) with Gaussian-based policies, suffer from limited expressivity and can result in out-of-distribution actions. In contrast, DiffCPS utilizes diffusion models, which possess superior distributional expressivity, to avoid these limitations while providing theoretical insights and optimizing the KL constraint via the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). The experimental results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that DiffCPS outperforms traditional AWR-based methods and other recent diffusion-based approaches.

### Strengths

1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The introduction of diffusion models to CPS in offline RL is an original and significant contribution. This approach tackles a well-known issue in offline RL—out-of-distribution actions—by leveraging the expressive capabilities of diffusion models.

2. **Theoretical Foundations**: The paper includes thorough theoretical analysis, including the reformulation of the CPS problem into a convex optimization framework, demonstrating the validity of the KL constraint, and the use of Lagrange duality. These theoretical insights add robustness to the proposed approach.

3. **Extensive Experiments**: The experiments conducted on D4RL datasets are comprehensive, contrasting DiffCPS against a variety of state-of-the-art methods. The results clearly indicate the efficacy of the proposed method, highlighting its performance improvements across multiple environments.

4. **Practical Implications**: The paper discusses the real-world relevance of offline RL and the potential of the proposed method to improve decision-making in applications such as healthcare and autonomous systems, thus offering a strong practical motivation for further exploration in the field.

5. **Clear Presentation**: The writing is generally clear and well-structured, guiding the reader fluidly through the theoretical background, methodology, and results. The inclusion of detailed experimental results helps validate the claims made by the authors.

### Weaknesses

1. **Complexity of Diffusion Models**: While the method's reliance on diffusion models is a strength, it may also pose practical challenges regarding implementation complexity and computational resources. The authors could discuss the feasibility of deploying DiffCPS in real-world scenarios where computational efficiency is crucial.

2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: The results indicate some reliance on hyperparameter tuning, particularly regarding the KL constraint. An exploration of the sensitivity to different tuning parameters and potential strategies for hyperparameter optimization could have enriched the paper.

3. **Limited Exploration of Alternatives**: While DiffCPS is compared against various methods, a more detailed exploration of how it behaves across different constraints and scenarios within the RL context could provide deeper insights. For example, including variations of behavior policies or testing on other datasets would demonstrate broader applicability.

4. **Discussion on Generalization**: The paper would benefit from a discussion regarding the generalization capabilities of the proposed method to various kinds of offline data distributions, particularly those that might present challenges other than those addressed by the current experiments.

5. **Ablation Studies**: Although ablation experiments are conducted, further investigation into the contributions of each component of DiffCPS would be useful. For instance, more information on the impact of different components in the diffusion model and the interplay between them could clarify their specific roles.

### Conclusion

Overall, this paper presents an innovative and impactful approach to constrained policy search in offline reinforcement learning. The theoretical contributions and empirical validation of the proposed DiffCPS method represent a meaningful advancement in the field. However, the practical implications of its complexity and hyperparameter sensitivity require further clarification. Addressing these concerns could strengthen the paper and its potential for real-world applications. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions focused on these points.
