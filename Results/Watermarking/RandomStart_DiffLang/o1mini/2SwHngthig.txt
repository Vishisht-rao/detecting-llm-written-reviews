**Review of "Towards Offline Opponent Modeling with In-Context Learning"**

**Summary**: The research presented in this paper addresses a significant challenge in the domain of opponent modeling by proposing a framework called Transformer Against Opponents (TAO). The main contribution of TAO is its formalization of Offline Opponent Modeling (OOM), which leverages pre-collected offline datasets for more efficient learning about opponent behaviors, goals, and beliefs, thereby bypassing the inefficiencies associated with online learning methods. The authors employ Transformers, particularly their in-context learning capabilities, to adapt to unknown opponent policies in dynamic environments.

**Strengths**:
1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The paper effectively identifies the limitations of online learning in opponent modeling, particularly in real-world applications where data is often collected offline. The transition to an offline paradigm is timely and relevant, considering the growing reliance on historical data across various fields like e-commerce and gaming.
  
2. **Methodological Rigor**: The proposed TAO framework is well-structured and articulated in three clear stages: offline policy embedding learning, opponent-aware response policy training, and deployment using in-context learning. This systematic approach contributes to the clarity of the research.

3. **Theoretical Contributions**: The paper provides theoretical guarantees concerning the equivalence of TAO to Bayesian posterior sampling, along with convergence proofs for opponent policy recognition. Such contributions may enhance understanding within the field and facilitate future research directions.

4. **Empirical Validation**: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TAO compared to baseline methods in various competitive environments (Markov Soccer and Particleworld Adversary). The ablation studies showcase the significance of different components, notably the critical role of the Policy Embedding Learning stage.

**Weaknesses**:
1. **Scalability**: While the paper establishes the effectiveness of TAO with fixed opponent policies, it does not adequately address how the approach would scale in scenarios with multiple, dynamic opponents. Future work should explore adaptations to models that can handle such complexity.

2. **Generalization across Domains**: The experiments primarily focus on a specific set of environments. It would enhance the study's applicability if the authors could provide evidence that TAO can generalize across a broader range of problem domains beyond the presented environments.

3. **Dependence on Offline Data Quality**: The authors assume access to high-quality offline datasets that are representative of the true distribution of opponent behavior. In practice, the fidelity of such datasets can vary, and this potential unpredictability should be discussed further, as poor-quality data could limit the effectiveness of TAO in real-world scenarios.

4. **Limitations and Future Work**: While the authors identify several limitations and propose directions for future research, a more detailed exploration of the potential challenges and methodologies that could address dynamic opponents or those engaged in opponent modeling would strengthen their conclusions.

**Conclusion**: Overall, this paper makes substantial contributions to the field of opponent modeling through its innovative approach to offline learning and effective utilization of Transformers. While the proposed framework shows promise, addressing the outlined weaknesses, especially concerning scalability and data considerations, will be essential for future iterations of this work. The findings are likely to stimulate further research into making opponent modeling more accessible and practical in a variety of competitive contexts.
