OUTPUT:
The document focuses on an important problem in the field of game theory and reinforcement learning, specifically addressing the challenges associated with convergence to Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum games. The authors propose novel algorithms—Anytime Double Oracle (ADO), Anytime PSRO (APSRO), and Self-Play PSRO (SP-PSRO)—that effectively manage exploitability during the iterative training process, which is critical in large-scale games. This is a significant contribution, as previous algorithms like PSRO can suffer from increased exploitability when terminated early, potentially leading to poor strategic outcomes.

The motivation for ensuring a monotonically non-increasing exploitability across iterations is well articulated. The authors provide a comprehensive theoretical foundation for their proposed methods, demonstrating their convergence properties and advantages over baseline approaches. The use of extensive-form games, which reflects realistic scenarios in competitive environments, adds relevance to their work.

### Strengths:

1. **Novel Algorithms**: The introduction of ADO, APSRO, and SP-PSRO offers fresh perspectives on mitigating the exploitability challenge in RL and game-theoretic contexts. Particularly, SP-PSRO’s inclusion of mixed strategies adds depth to the exploration of policy spaces.

2. **Robust Empirical Validation**: The empirical results presented across various games (like Leduc Poker and Liar’s Dice) convincingly showcase SP-PSRO's superior performance in reducing exploitability compared to baselines like PSRO and APSRO. This is particularly important for demonstrating the practical applicability of the theories presented.

3. **Clear Explanations and Theoretical Insights**: The paper articulates complex ideas in a clear manner, providing rigorous mathematical formulations and intuitive explanations. The use of propositions to outline the properties of the algorithms enhances the readability and understanding of the theoretical contributions.

4. **Extensive Experiments**: The breadth of experiments conducted—covering both normal-form and extensive-form games—provides a holistic view of the performance of the proposed algorithms. The comparative analyses further clarify the advantages of the proposed methods.

### Areas for Improvement:

1. **Limitation Discussion**: While the paper mentions limitations, such as the potential for the new strategy to not be useful, a more in-depth exploration of these limitations and their implications on the algorithms’ performance would be beneficial. Consider providing concrete examples or scenarios where these limitations manifest.

2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: An exploration of the sensitivity of the algorithms to hyperparameter choices would be helpful. The performance of policy-based methods can vary significantly based on these choices, and including this analysis could aid practitioners in applying the methods effectively.

3. **Further Comparative Baselines**: The discussion could benefit from additional comparisons against more recent or alternate algorithms in the field, especially since the landscape of multi-agent reinforcement learning is rapidly evolving. Incorporating insights from other recent advancements could provide context for the relative performance of SP-PSRO and its potential advantages.

4. **Analysis of Scalability**: Given the nature of large games, more analysis on the scalability of these approaches in massively multiplayer scenarios would be useful. While the performance metrics are impressive, discussing how these algorithms might perform as the number of agents increases would add depth to the findings.

### Summary:

In summary, the paper significantly advances the field of reinforcement learning in competitive settings through the introduction of ADO, APSRO, and SP-PSRO, effectively addressing the challenge of exploitability in strategy learning. With rigorous theoretical foundations and substantial empirical results, the authors lay a solid groundwork for future research. While there are areas for improvement, particularly regarding limitation discussions and comparative analyses, the contributions of this work are poised to impact the development of strategies for navigating complex competitive environments effectively. Overall, this paper is recommended for acceptance at ICLR 2024, given its innovative approach and solid findings.
