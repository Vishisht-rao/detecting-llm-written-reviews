**Review of "RE-IMAGINE THE NEGATIVE PROMPT ALGORITHM FOR 2D/3D DIFFUSION"**

**Summary:**
This paper presents a novel approach called Perp-Neg, aimed at improving the effectiveness of negative prompts in text-to-image diffusion models. The authors argue that current negative prompt implementations fail when overlap with positive prompts occurs. To address this issue, they propose a geometric methodology that utilizes perpendicular denoising directions to better manage and eliminate unwanted attributes without adversely affecting the main concept. The proposed algorithm is shown to enhance the generation of images in both 2D and 3D diffusion applications, including improvements in addressing the Janus problem associated with 3D generation.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty of Approach:** The concept of leveraging perpendicular gradients to improve the handling of negative prompts is innovative. This geometric perspective could contribute significantly to the field by resolving existing limitations in prompt engineering.
  
2. **Experimental Validation:** The authors present a thorough set of experiments, demonstrating the efficacy of Perp-Neg across various scenarios, both in 2D and 3D. The clear quantitative and qualitative results bolster their claims about the improvements offered by Perp-Neg over existing methodologies, such as CEBM and standard negative prompts.

3. **Clear Structure:** The paper is well-structured, leading the reader from the introduction of the problem to the formulation of the new algorithm, its integration into existing frameworks, and extensive experimental results. The use of figures effectively illustrates the concepts and results, making them accessible.

4. **Relevance to Current Research Trends:** Given the rapid advancements in generative models, the topic is highly relevant, and the findings can influence future research directions in text-to-image generation.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Lack of Theoretical Foundation:** While the paper highlights the effectiveness of Perp-Neg, it would benefit from a deeper theoretical exploration of the geometric properties utilized in the algorithm. Further discussion on the mathematical reasoning behind why perpendicular gradients assist in reducing semantic overlap could strengthen the theoretical underpinning.

2. **Comparative Analysis:** Although the paper compares Perp-Neg to existing methods, it could enhance its impact by including a broader range of baselines or existing techniques, thus providing a more comprehensive comparison. Discussions on the specific contexts or conditions under which Perp-Neg outperforms others could also be beneficial.

3. **Limitations and Future Work:** While the paper briefly mentions the Janus problem, it would be wise to address potential limitations or scenarios where Perp-Neg may still struggle. Additionally, suggestions for future research avenues inspired by the findings would enrich the conclusion.

4. **Over-reliance on Visual Evidence:** The success of the proposed method is heavily illustrated through visual evidence. While qualitative results are essential, more statistical analysis or metrics could provide a more substantive basis for claims, reinforcing the reliability of the experiments.

**Minor Comments:**
- The abstract could be more concise, focusing on the core contributions without excessive background.
- Some references throughout the document were cited with a mix of alphanumeric labels (e.g., "Figure 1") and could maintain consistency for clarity.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a significant advancement in addressing a well-identified problem in text-to-image diffusion models. The proposal is innovative, backed by experimental evidence, and relevant to ongoing research efforts in generative models. By addressing theoretical and comparative aspects more comprehensively and acknowledging limitations, the work could be further strengthened. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
