### Review of "On the Hardness of Learning Under Symmetries"

#### Summary
This paper investigates the computational complexity of learning equivariant neural networks, emphasizing the impact of symmetry on the hardness of function approximation. The authors provide significant contributions in the form of lower bounds for various architectures, including shallow graph neural networks (GNNs), convolutional networks (CNNs), and frame-averaged networks. They establish foundational results demonstrating that known problem symmetries do not alleviate the inherent computational hardness of learning by gradient descent.

#### Novelty and Contributions
1. **Theoretical Framework**: The paper introduces a structured approach to understanding the complexity of learning equivariant models through a combination of learning theory and symmetry. The use of the correlational statistical query (CSQ) model to derive lower bounds is a noteworthy approach, enhancing the understanding of the stiffness of learning in complex models.

2. **Lower Bounds**: The authors successfully show that learning certain architectural classes remains hard despite the introduction of symmetry, with results indicating exponential and superpolynomial lower bounds across multiple settings. This is particularly insightful as it contrasts the empirical success of equivariant neural networks in practical scenarios with theoretical limitations in learning efficiency.

3. **Extension of Previous Work**: The paper builds on established results from prior research and extends them into the realm of equivariant networks. By doing so, it unifies concepts from various branches of learning theory, reinforcing previously unclear connections between them.

4. **Empirical Verification**: The exploration of learning behaviors through experiments adds a practical dimension to the theoretical framework, showcasing the limitations of GNNs and CNNs when attempting to learn complex invariant functions.

#### Strengths
- **Depth of Analysis**: The thorough analysis of the computational complexity is impressive, covering various architectures and providing detailed proofs.
- **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is well-structured, with clear definitions, theorems, and a coherent flow from problem statement through methods to results.
- **Experimental Validation**: The inclusion of experimental results serves to demonstrate the applicability of the theoretical findings, grounding the theoretical claims in practical observations.

#### Weaknesses
- **Experimental Conditions**: While the experiments provide insight, additional variability in experimental setups or broader comparisons with other learning algorithms could enhance the robustness of claims regarding the hardness of learning equivariant networks.
- **Generalizability of Results**: The paper focuses on specific architectures and distributions. A discussion on the generalizability of the results to other forms of neural architectures or data distributions could benefit readers seeking insights relevant to a broader context.

#### Areas for Improvement
- **Diagrammatic Representation**: Including diagrams to elucidate complex concepts such as symmetries and learning architectures could help in improving audience comprehension.
- **Holistic Review of Related Works**: The related work section could be more comprehensive. While it touches on key prior studies, a deeper comparative analysis of how this work fits within the broader field could provide more context.

#### Conclusion
Overall, this paper makes significant contributions to the understanding of the complexity of learning under symmetries in neural networks. Its rigorous analysis, thoughtful organization, and empirical findings present a vital piece of research for both the theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning, particularly in applications involving structured data. Addressing the mentioned weaknesses and areas for improvement could strengthen the paper further, solidifying its impact on the community. I recommend acceptance for presentation at ICLR 2024, as it offers valuable insights into a foundational problem in machine learning theory.
