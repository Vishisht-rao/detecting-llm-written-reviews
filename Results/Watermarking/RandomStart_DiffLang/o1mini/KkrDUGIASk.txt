**Review of the Paper: "AN EXTENSIBLE FRAMEWORK FOR OPEN HETEROGENEOUS COLLABORATIVE PERCEPTION"**

**Summary:**
The authors present a novel framework called HEterogeneous ALliance (HEAL) aimed at enhancing collaborative perception in the context of heterogeneous multi-agent environments. This framework addresses the challenge of integrating new, previously unseen types of agents (with different modalities and models) into collaborative perception systems. HEAL proposes a two-phase training process that enables ease of integration while maintaining high performance and low training costs. The paper introduces a new dataset, OPV2V-H, to facilitate and validate this research, along with extensive experimental evaluation demonstrating substantial performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Contribution:** The work addresses a pertinent problem in the field of multi-agent collaborative perception, particularly the challenge of integrating heterogeneous agents that are not homogeneously equipped. The concept of "open heterogeneous collaborative perception" is introduced, providing a fresh perspective on an under-explored area.

2. **Innovative Methodology:** HEAL utilizes a multi-scale foreground-aware Pyramid Fusion network to establish a unified feature space, which is an innovative approach for the field. The backward alignment technique proposed for integrating new agents is particularly noteworthy as it reduces training costs significantly compared to collective training methods.

3. **Experimental Validation:** The authors conducted extensive experiments leveraging two datasets (OPV2V-H and DAIR-V2X) to validate their claims. Highlighting performance metrics such as precision and training efficiency provides concrete evidence of HEAL's improvements over SOTA methods.

4. **Dataset Development:** The creation of the OPV2V-H dataset enriches the available resources for researchers in heterogeneous collaborative perception, addressing the current shortcomings of existing datasets that focus primarily on homogeneous settings.

5. **Scalability:** The framework’s ability to continuously incorporate new agent types without extensive retraining is a key strength, positioning HEAL as a scalable solution suitable for real-world applications.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limitations in Generalizability:** While the experiments highlight impressive results, the reliance on two specific datasets may limit the generalizability of the findings. Additional validation across a wider range of scenarios and real-world data sets would strengthen the claims.

2. **Complexity and Computation Expense:** Although the method reduces training costs related to the integration of new agents, the initial training phase (collaboration base training) may still require significant computational resources. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion on the computational efficiencies achieved over a variety of settings and agent types.

3. **Dependence on BEV Representation:** The necessity for Bird's Eye View (BEV) feature representation might pose challenges for not all existing systems and models, particularly those that are keypoint-based or utilize different spatial orientations. The authors should discuss potential strategies or adaptations to broaden HEAL's applicability.

4. **Evaluation Metrics:** The performance metrics used (accuracy, training time) are good indicators, but including additional metrics such as F1-score or recall could provide a more comprehensive evaluation landscape.

5. **Potential Privacy Concerns:** While the framework addresses privacy through local training, the implications of data sharing in collaborative schemes still warrant careful consideration. Discussing the potential risks involved could enrich the paper's conclusions.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper provides significant contributions to the emerging field of open heterogeneous collaborative perception. HEAL demonstrates a compelling solution that effectively balances performance with integration flexibility, introducing critical innovations in the approach to collaborative data sharing among heterogeneous agents. Future work that addresses the limitations identified above—particularly through broader empirical validation and enhanced discussions on computational and privacy concerns—will further solidify the impact of this research. I recommend accepting this paper for presentation at the conference, with considerations for the suggested improvements.
