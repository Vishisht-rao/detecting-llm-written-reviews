### Review of "DataInf: Efficiently Estimating Data Influence in LoRA-Tuned LLMs and Diffusion Models"

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel method named DataInf designed for efficient estimation of data influence in large-scale machine learning models, particularly in the context of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA. The authors argue that traditional influence functions, while principled, are computationally intensive and unsuitable for large language models (LLMs) or diffusion models. DataInf introduces a closed-form approximation for the influence function that boasts better computational and memory efficiency than existing methods. The paper includes a theoretical analysis supporting the method’s efficacy, along with extensive empirical evaluations demonstrating its performance across various state-of-the-art models.

**Strengths:**
1. **Relevance and Importance:** The study addresses a significant concern in machine learning: understanding the impact of training data on model predictions. As AI systems become more integrated into critical applications, the need for transparency and reliability increases, making this work timely and relevant.
   
2. **Novel Contribution:** DataInf's approach of using a closed-form expression for estimating influence function values shows a promising advance in computational efficiency. This contribution is essential given the rising popularity of large-scale models, where traditional influence computation methods often face prohibitive costs.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The authors provide a thorough set of experiments across multiple tasks and models, including RoBERTa, Llama-2, and stable-diffusion models. The effectiveness of their method is demonstrated through comparison with existing influence computation methods (e.g., LiSSA, Hessian-free) across various tasks, including approximate influence analysis, mislabeled data detection, and influential data identification.

4. **Theory and Practice Connection:** The theoretical analysis supporting DataInf's efficiency, including the error bounds, is well-articulated and relevant. The empirical results reinforce the theoretical claims, demonstrating that the method is not only efficient but also practical for real-world applications.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Assumptions and Limitations:** While the proposed method claims robustness through theoretical bounds, the dependence on the assumption that first-order gradients and damping parameters are bounded may not hold in all applications. The paper could provide further discussion on the implications if these assumptions are violated.

2. **Comparison with More Baselines:** The work primarily compares DataInf with a few existing methods. Including additional baselines or alternative techniques (e.g., Shapley-based methods, reinforcement learning-based data valuation) would provide a more comprehensive insight into where DataInf stands in the broader landscape of data influence estimation techniques.

3. **Real-World Data Considerations:** While the artificial datasets used for experiments provide clear results, the performance on real-world noisy datasets could be discussed further, considering the potential complexities and extraneous factors involved in real applications.

4. **Potential for Further Research:** The paper mentions future research directions, particularly regarding the limitations of influence scores in generative AI contexts. Additional specifics on potential research avenues would strengthen this section and provide clearer guidance for following studies.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper successfully introduces an innovative and necessary approach to estimating data influence for contemporary machine learning models, addressing critical efficiency issues. Despite some areas that could benefit from additional depth and broader comparisons, the contributions are significant, the experiments are well-designed, and the practical implications are compelling. I recommend this paper for acceptance, as its findings could greatly enhance our understanding of data influence in complex, large-scale machine learning systems.
