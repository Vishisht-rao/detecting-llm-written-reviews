**Review of "Analyzing Neural Network-Based Generative Diffusion Models via Convexification"**

**Summary and Contributions:**
This paper presents a theoretical framework for analyzing two-layer neural network-based diffusion models, particularly focusing on score-based models that estimate the score function of underlying data distributions. The authors introduce a novel convex optimization formulation that allows for the global optimality of the score matching objective while addressing the computational challenges linked to gradient-based methods, especially in the presence of activation functions like ReLU. The main contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:

1. Establishing an equivalent convex program for the score matching objective, circumventing issues associated with calculating Jacobians in high-dimensional settings.
2. Characterizing the generated distribution of samples as either Gaussian or Gaussian-Laplace under certain regularization conditions, specifically for univariate data.
3. Deriving a convex program for the denoising score matching objective, providing an alternative approach to the traditional score matching task, and showcasing numerical simulations that validate the theoretical findings.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty**: The application of convex optimization techniques to improve the training of neural networks for scoring diffusion processes is innovative. This framing could have broad implications for future research in generative modeling and neural network training.
2. **Theoretical Depth**: The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis, supported by relevant theorems and proofs that substantiate the claims made regarding convergence and distribution characteristics.
3. **Comprehensive Simulations**: The inclusion of numerical experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed convex formulations adds empirical support to the theoretical results. The comparison of convex optimization with traditional methods in terms of convergence rates is particularly insightful.
4. **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is well-structured, logically presenting background information, contributions, and results. The organization aids in reader comprehension, making complex concepts more accessible.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limitation to Two-Layer Networks**: The focus on two-layer neural networks, while significant, may limit the applicability of results. Expanding the discussion to more complex architectures could enhance the relevance of the findings to contemporary deep learning practices.
2. **Dependence on Activation Functions**: The analyses are heavily reliant on specific activation functions (ReLU and absolute value). Including other common activations or discussing the implications of using different architectures would be advantageous.
3. **Limited Practical Examples**: While the simulations provide some empirical validation, real-world applications are not extensively discussed, which would strengthen the case for the proposed methods.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. Consider extending the analysis to more complex network architectures, providing insights into how the convexification approach could be adapted or modified for such models.
2. Include discussions on alternative activation functions and their impacts on the theoretical and practical outcomes.
3. Provide additional empirical results or case studies that highlight the practical implications of the convex formulation in various domains beyond simple synthetic data.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, this paper successfully presents a novel perspective on generative diffusion models through the lens of convex optimization. The theoretical contributions are solidly backed up by empirical evidence, making the work a meaningful addition to the literature on generative modeling. Addressing the noted weaknesses could further enhance the paper's impact and relevance to the broader machine learning community. I recommend acceptance of this paper, with minor revisions to address the aforementioned suggestions.
