**Review of "Adaptive Rational Activations to Boost Deep Reinforcement Learning"**

**Summary:**
The study examines the concept of neural plasticity in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and proposes the incorporation of adaptable rational activation functions in neural networks as a means to enhance the performance of reinforcement learning agents in dynamic environments. The authors argue that existing fixed activation functions do not adequately support the plasticity required for agents to adapt to ever-changing environments. The paper presents a novel method called joint-rational activation, which shares activation parameters across layers to regularize plasticity and mitigate overfitting while providing flexibility.

**Strengths:**
1. **Relevant Context**: The correlation between neural plasticity and effectiveness in DRL is a timely and significant topic in the AI community. The authors successfully contextualize their work within this ongoing research, linking theoretical findings from neuroscience to practical applications in machine learning.

2. **Methodological Innovation**: The introduction of rational activation functions that can be dynamically adjusted during training is an innovative approach to enhance adaptability. The joint-rational variant appears to balance expressiveness and generalization effectively, which is crucial in reinforcement learning contexts where overfitting can lead to detrimental performance drops.

3. **Comprehensive Experimental Validation**: The authors conduct thorough experiments comparing various activation functions and demonstrate that their approach consistently outperforms multiple existing algorithms, evidenced by increased performance on the Atari Learning Environment across numerous games. The empirical results are robust and provide a solid foundation for their claims.

4. **Addressing Overestimation Issues**: The exploration of how rational plasticity can reduce the overestimation phenomenon prevalent in DQN architectures is a valuable contribution to the literature. This aspect specifically targets a well-known limitation in reinforcement learning, adding significant relevance to the proposed method.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity and Interpretability**: While the joint-rational activation functions are theoretically compelling, their complexity may hinder interpretability, which can be a critical factor in deployments of reinforcement learning agents, especially in sensitive contexts. The authors could strengthen their argument by providing insights on how this complexity can be managed or understood in practical applications.

2. **Generalizability of Results**: Although the proposed method demonstrates significant improvements on selected Atari games, the generalizability of these results to diverse real-world tasks remains uncertain. More discussions on potential limitations or scenarios where the method might falter would enhance the quality of the work.

3. **Lack of Theoretical Framework**: While the paper includes empirical results and some motivation of ideas from biology, it would benefit from a more extensive theoretical framework that delves into why rational functions specifically lead to improved plasticity over other types. A clearer theoretical underpinning could lend more weight to the experimental findings.

4. **Computational Costs**: The authors briefly mention the computational costs associated with training the proposed methods but do not provide a comprehensive analysis of efficiency compared to existing architectures. A detailed discussion on the trade-offs between performance gains and increased computational burdens would be useful for practitioners considering adoption.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Expand discussions on the interpretability and potential limitations of the proposed method, including conditions where it may not perform as expected.
- Provide a more rigorous theoretical justification for the effectiveness of rational activation functions in promoting plasticity.
- Include additional benchmarks or real-world applications to further validate the generalizability of their findings.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of deep reinforcement learning by addressing the critical aspect of neural plasticity through adaptable rational activations. It effectively demonstrates strong empirical results while setting a solid foundation for future work in this area. However, the authors should consider enhancing the theoretical aspects and addressing the complexities related to interpretability and computational costs to make their contributions more accessible and actionable for practitioners.
