**Review of "SCORE-BASED MULTIMODAL AUTOENCODERS"**

**Overview:**
The authors present a novel approach to multimodal generative modeling through a variant of Variational Autoencoders (V AEs) enhanced by score-based modeling (SBM). They aim to address the decline in generative quality as the number of modalities increases, as highlighted by previous work. The proposed model, referred to as Multimodal SBM (SBM-V AE), leverages the strengths of unimodal V AEs while ensuring coherence across multiple modalities without necessitating the construction of a joint multimodal Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO).

**Strengths:**
1. **Problem Relevance:**
   The decline in generative quality of existing multimodal V AEs as the number of modalities increases is a pertinent problem in the field of generative models. The authors also make an effective case for the importance of coherent multimodal representations, both in terms of conditional generation and unconditional coherence.

2. **Innovative Approach:**
   The introduction of a score-based model to enforce coherence among latent variables presents a fresh perspective in tackling multimodal learning. By focusing on a joint latent space rather than a shared representation, the authors establish a potential solution to the limitations noted in previous works. 

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:**
   The paper provides an extensive array of experiments across multiple datasets—including Extended PolyMNIST and CelebAMask-HQ—which demonstrates the proposed model's effectiveness against various baselines. The quantitative and qualitative results are compelling, showcasing significant improvements in generative quality and coherence.

4. **Clear Architecture Diagram:**
   Figure 1 provides a clear visualization of the model architecture, aiding comprehension of the proposed methodology.

5. **Future Work Considerations:**
   The authors acknowledge the existing limitations, such as the assumption of all modalities being present during training. Their plans for addressing this in future work is a positive indicator of their intent to refine and advance their methodology.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Technical Complexity:**
   While the paper is rich in detail, some aspects of the methodology, particularly the mathematical formulation (Equations 2, 3, 4, and 10), appear dense and could benefit from further clarification or simplification to be more accessible to a broader audience, especially those less familiar with generative models.

2. **Coherence Guidance Section:**
   The energy-based coherence guidance mechanism is an interesting addition; however, the section could elaborate more on its implementation details, especially how this guidance impacts the model’s performance across different scenarios. More experimental validation of the coherence guidance's effect could strengthen the argument.

3. **Comparative Analysis:**
   Although the authors compare their model against several multimodal V AEs, including mixtures of experts and previous models, a more direct comparison with the most recent state-of-the-art methods (including diffusion models) could further solidify their position and relevance in the rapidly evolving landscape of generative modeling.

4. **Assumptions in Training:**
   While the assumption of all modalities during training is noted as a limitation, the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the potential impact of this limitation in practical applications. A discussion on how this could affect real-world usability would be beneficial.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the area of multimodal generative modeling by introducing a novel approach that enhances coherence and quality in generated outputs. The methodology is innovative, and the thorough experiments support the claims made by the authors. However, improvements in clarity and accessibility, as well as stronger comparative analysis with the latest models, would enhance the paper's impact further. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the identified issues.
