**Review of "CAREFUL AT ESTIMATION AND BOLD AT EXPLORATION FOR DETERMINISTIC POLICY GRADIENT ALGORITHM"**

**Summary:**
This paper proposes a novel exploration strategy for deterministic policy reinforcement learning (DPRL) called the Bold Actor Conservative Critic (BACC). The authors address the challenges of unguided exploration and exclusive policy in continuous action spaces, which arise from soft policy learning. Their approach introduces an exploration policy that utilizes Q-values to guide out-of-distribution exploration, enhancing the efficiency of exploration strategies in complex environments. They validate their method on Mujoco and Roboschool benchmarks and report significant performance improvements, especially in challenging environments like Humanoid.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Contribution:** The introduction of a Q-value-guided exploration policy is a compelling contribution to the field. It effectively addresses the issues of unguided exploration and suboptimal policy convergence due to exclusive policies.
  
2. **Thorough Evaluation:** The paper presents a comprehensive experimental evaluation across various environments in Mujoco and Roboschool, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed method compared to several baseline approaches, including state-of-the-art algorithms like TD3 and SAC.

3. **Clear Theoretical Foundations:** The research builds on existing theoretical frameworks, such as the dynamic Boltzmann softmax update and the double Q-function, and provides sufficient mathematical rigor in proving the convergence of the proposed exploration method.

4. **Detailed Explanations and Visuals:** The authors provide clear explanations of their methodology, supported by visualizations that enhance understanding. The experiments are well-structured, allowing readers to grasp the effectiveness of the BACC approach relative to others.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Discussion of Practical Limitations:** While the paper does touch on limitations, such as performance in low-dimensional action spaces, it could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of potential drawbacks and areas where the BACC method might struggle.

2. **Reproducibility Concerns:** Although the authors mention the availability of code and detailed algorithm descriptions, the experimental setup details could be expanded to ensure full reproducibility by other researchers. For instance, clarifying hyperparameter choices or configurations used in the experiments outside of the tables would strengthen this aspect.

3. **Comparison with More Recent Methods:** The paper primarily focuses on comparisons with previously established algorithms. Including comparisons with the most recent advancements in exploration strategies, potentially published since the initial submission, could illustrate the current standing of BACC more definitively.

4. **Generalization to Other Domains:** While the paper excels in simulated environments, it does not address the applicability of the proposed method to real-world scenarios or more diverse tasks beyond those tested. A small discussion on how the approach might be adapted or its limitations in real-world applications would be beneficial.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of reinforcement learning by presenting a novel exploration method that effectively leverages Q-values in continuous action spaces. The thorough evaluations and sound theoretical foundations support the claims made by the authors. Addressing the weaknesses noted above would enhance the paper's impact, and I recommend it for acceptance, with the expectation of minor revisions to improve clarity and comprehensiveness.
