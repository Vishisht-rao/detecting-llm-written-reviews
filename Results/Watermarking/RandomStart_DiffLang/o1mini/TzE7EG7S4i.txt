# Review of "High-Dimensional Geometric Streaming for Nearly Low-Rank Data"

## Summary

The paper presents a streaming algorithm for estimating the outer \((d-k)\)-radius of a set of high-dimensional points, providing a significant advancement over existing methods. The authors introduce a coreset construction algorithm that operates efficiently in a streaming context, effectively handling nearly low-rank datasets. They outline the use of \(\ell_p\) subspace approximation as a fundamental tool in their approach, and they demonstrate that their method not only mitigates space complexity issues but also outperforms previous algorithms in terms of approximation error.

## Strengths

1. **Novel Contribution**: The proposed streaming coreset algorithm stands out by efficiently selecting a limited number of rows while still enabling effective approximation of the outer \((d-k)\)-radius without relying on semidefinite programming, which is crucial in handling high-dimensional data streams.

2. **Theoretical Foundations**: The authors provide a solid theoretical framework, including multiple theorems with clear informal statements, that justify the performance and capabilities of their algorithm. They effectively demonstrate how specific conditions (i.e., when the data is "almost" low-rank) lead to improved approximation bounds.

3. **Broad Applicability**: The paper situates its contributions within a wider context, linking the algorithmic developments to established problems in geometric data analysis, such as width estimation and convex hulls. This shows the potential for practical applications in machine learning and data mining.

4. **Experimental Validation**: The authors present extensive experimental results that affirm the effectiveness and efficiency of their algorithm in practical scenarios, such as image processing, which adds credibility to their theoretical claims.

5. **Clear Presentation**: The paper is well-organized, with a logical flow from the introduction through results, proofs, and applications. Figures and references to existing literature are employed judiciously to clarify complex ideas.

## Weaknesses

1. **Assumption of "Nearly Low-Rank"**: While the algorithm demonstrates significant advantages under the assumption of "almost" low-rank structures, it raises questions about its robustness in more general settings. It would be beneficial for the authors to address how the algorithm performs with highly irregular or noisy data that deviates considerably from low-rank behavior.

2. **Complexity Discussion**: The time complexity analysis might benefit from a more granular breakdown to clarify how each component of the algorithm contributes to the overall performance. The authors could also analyze how the algorithm scales with respect to various parameters in different scenarios, particularly concerning the dimensionality \(d\).

3. **Limitations of Coreset Size**: While the selected size of the subset \(S\) promises efficiency, further exploration into worst-case scenarios or extremely large \(d\) could provide insight into the limitations of the coreset construction. 

4. **Missing Comparative Baselines**: Although the paper contrasts its contributions with prior work, a more detailed empirical comparison against existing streaming algorithms would strengthen the claims made regarding its superiority.

5. **Clarity on Randomization**: The randomized elements of the algorithm, particularly in the context of utilizing exponential random variables in \(\ell_p\) approximations, could use more detailed explanation to help readers fully appreciate the implications of these techniques.

## Conclusion

Overall, this paper makes a commendable contribution to the field of geometric data streaming. It successfully merges theoretical advancements with practical implementations, providing a coherent framework that can potentially influence further research in high-dimensional data analysis. Addressing the above-mentioned concerns may enhance the paper's clarity and breadth of impact even further. I recommend acceptance for presentation at ICLR 2024, pending minor revisions to clarify algorithmic robustness and comparative performance.
