**Review of "Improving Sample Efficiency in Off-Policy RL with Low-Dimensional Policy Representation"**

The manuscript presents a novel approach to enhancing sample efficiency in off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) through low-dimensional policy representations, addressing the interplay between function approximation and off-policy learning under the constraints of the "Deadly Triad." The authors propose a two-fold improvement: first, utilizing policy representations as additional input for value functions to facilitate better function approximation; second, enhancing off-policy learning by conducting additional value learning for proximal historical policies. The empirical results demonstrate significant improvements in sample efficiency and stability across multiple continuous control tasks on OpenAI Gym.

### Strengths:

1. **Clear Motivation and Relevance:**
   The relevance of the Deadly Triad in off-policy RL, coupled with the focus on under-explored areas of function approximation and off-policy learning, sets a compelling stage for the proposed improvements. This interest is well-grounded in existing literature and immediately indicates the contribution's value.

2. **Innovative Approach:**
   The introduction of low-dimensional policy representations and the Generalized Off-Policy Evaluation (GOPE) framework are innovative. By reformulating the Bellman operator and exploring historical policy evaluations, the authors provide a fresh perspective that could inspire further developments in off-policy RL methodologies.

3. **Comprehensive Experimentation:**
   The practical implementations of the proposed method on TD3 and SAC are well-documented, demonstrating effectiveness across six continuous control tasks. The inclusion of ablation studies strengthens the findings by analyzing the contributions of individual components to the overall performance.

4. **Results Presentation:**
   The results are clearly presented, using both average and maximum evaluation returns. The inclusion of normalized improvements quantifies the performance gains, making the arguments robust.

5. **Attention to Mechanistic Insights:**
   The investigation into the dynamics of policy representations and the proposal of a Layer-wise Permutation-invariant Encoder with Dynamic Masking underscores a solid understanding of the inner workings of neural networks and their implications for RL.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Limited Theoretical Analysis:**
   While the manuscript presents theoretical insights regarding the new Bellman operator and value generalization, a more in-depth theoretical framework that delineates the convergence properties and potential limitations of the proposed algorithm would benefit the paper significantly.

2. **Scalability and Generality:**
   The empirical results demonstrate success on specific continuous control tasks; however, the manuscript lacks a discussion on the scalability of the method to more complex environments or tasks, which may introduce challenges not encountered in the tested settings.

3. **Potential for Overfitting:**
   As the proposed methods effectively leverage historical policy evaluations, a concern may arise regarding overfitting on specific policies during training. An explicit examination of generalization to unseen tasks would enhance the validity of the proposed methods.

4. **Presentation of Ablations:**
   Although the ablation experiments aim to isolate the contributions of components, some findings (e.g., complementary nature of GOPE and policy representation) could be highlighted more explicitly to aid readability and understanding of the results.

### Conclusion:

Overall, this manuscript presents a significant contribution to the field of off-policy reinforcement learning. It successfully identifies key limitations in existing methodologies and proposes innovative solutions to address them. Despite certain weaknesses in the theoretical depth and scalability discussions, the experimental findings support the efficacy of the proposed strategies. The work is poised to influence future research directions in off-policy RL and warrants publication following minor adjustments and additional discussions on theoretical and practical implications.
