### Review of "EDITVAL: Benchmarking Diffusion based Text-Guided Image Editing Methods"

The manuscript explores an important and timely subject: the evaluation of text-guided image editing methods using state-of-the-art diffusion models like Stable Diffusion and Imagen. The authors identify a significant gap in the literature regarding standardized benchmarks for measuring the effectiveness and fidelity of these methods across different types of edits. By proposing EDITVAL, they aim to create a comprehensive framework that includes a curated dataset of images, defined editable attributes, and an automated evaluation pipeline, complemented by human evaluations.

#### Strengths:

1. **Comprehensive Approach**: The authorsâ€™ approach in developing a standardized evaluation framework is commendable. By combining automated evaluations with human assessments, they create a robust mechanism to gauge the performance of various editing methods across multiple edit types.

2. **Variety of Edit Types**: The identification and categorization of 13 distinct edit types, ranging from object addition to viewpoint changes, allow for an extensive analysis of the capabilities of different editing methods. This diversified scope adds value as it reflects real-world use cases.

3. **Correlation with Human Preferences**: The study presents compelling results demonstrating a strong correlation between the automated evaluation scores and human preferences, validating the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline. This correlation enhances the credibility of the methodology and its practical applicability.

4. **Publicly Available Resources**: The commitment to openly sharing the EDITVAL benchmark, dataset, evaluation scripts, and human study templates is a significant contribution that can facilitate further research and development in the field.

5. **Thorough Results**: The manuscript provides a comprehensive analysis of the performance of eight state-of-the-art editing methods, offering insights into their strengths and weaknesses. The findings that no single method excels across all editing types and that spatial edits pose significant challenges are particularly noteworthy.

#### Weaknesses:

1. **Limited Scope of Automation**: While the authors explore multiple edit types, the automated evaluation pipeline primarily focuses on a subset of six out of the thirteen types for reliability reasons. Although argued well, this limitation may restrict the overall applicability of the benchmark for all editing scenarios.

2. **Human Study Limitations**: Although a large-scale human study is implemented, the authors could elaborate more on potential biases inherent in human evaluations and how they ensure consistency among different annotators. The discussion of how worker quality is assessed could also be expanded.

3. **Potential for Overlap in Edit Types**: While each edit type is defined, some may have inherent overlaps in what they represent, such as object addition and positional addition. Further clarification on how the authors manage potential ambiguities in edit types would strengthen the manuscript.

4. **Future Work Directions**: The discussion on future work could be enhanced. Proposals for improving automated evaluations, handling spatial edits more effectively, or expanding the benchmark to include more diverse editing scenarios could guide subsequent research directions.

#### Suggestions for Improvement:

- Include a more detailed discussion regarding the potential limitations of human evaluators and how the results could be impacted by varying subjective interpretations of the edit instructions.
- Elaborate on how to address limitations in automated evaluations, particularly related to spatial operations, perhaps by exploring emerging models in the field that could be integrated into the evaluation pipeline.
- Make explicit the criteria for selecting the 648 unique operations in EDITVAL, ensuring that the rationale is clear and justified.
- Consider discussing implications of the study for practical applications across various industries, linking the theoretical contributions of the framework to tangible outcomes in design and engineering.

#### Conclusion:

Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of text-guided image editing by establishing EDITVAL, a standardized benchmarking framework. It addresses a critical need for evaluating cutting-edge methods in a structured way and provides valuable insights that can aid not just in research, but also in practical applications. With minor revisions and enhancements, the manuscript could further bolster its impact within the community. I recommend acceptance with the suggested improvements for clarity and depth throughout the manuscript.
