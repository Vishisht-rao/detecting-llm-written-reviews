### Review of "Diffusion Posterior Sampling for Linear Inverse Problem Solving — A Filtering Perspective"

#### Summary
The authors present a novel method called Filtering Posterior Sampling (FPS) to solve linear inverse problems using diffusion models. The proposed approach aims to address the limitations of existing diffusion models in terms of Bayesian posterior sampling, which is often intractable and computationally expensive. By establishing a connection between Bayesian posterior sampling and Bayesian filtering, the authors claim to provide a framework that guarantees asymptotic accuracy in sampling. The method also integrates seamlessly with various Markovian diffusion samplers and does not require retraining of the models.

#### Strengths
1. **Innovative Framework**:
   - The introduction of FPS provides a fresh perspective on the long-standing problem of posterior sampling in the context of diffusion models. By linking it to Bayesian filtering, the authors offer a solid theoretical foundation.

2. **Theoretical Guarantees**:
   - The authors prove that their method yields accurate samples as the particle count increases, which is a significant step toward ensuring the reliability of such sampling techniques. The theoretical consistency guarantee is a commendable feature.

3. **Empirical Validation**:
   - The experimental results demonstrate that FPS outperforms existing approaches on several tasks, including image inpainting, super-resolution, and motion deblurring. The use of established datasets (FFHQ and ImageNet) adds robustness to the validation of the proposed methodology.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The claim that FPS does not require the optimization or retraining of neural networks makes it particularly appealing for practitioners looking for efficient solutions to linear inverse problems.

5. **Comprehensive Evaluation**:
   - The paper includes multiple experiments with varying tasks and settings, demonstrating a thorough evaluation of the proposed method across different problem domains.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Complexity and Clarity**:
   - While the theory presented is robust, the exposition may be challenging for readers not well-versed in Bayesian filtering or diffusion models. The authors could benefit from simplifying certain sections or enhancing the clarity of explanations, particularly in deriving the connection between posterior sampling and filtering.

2. **Limited Exploration of Nonlinear Problems**:
   - The focus on linear inverse problems is clear, but the implications of the proposed method on nonlinear problems remain unaddressed. A discussion on future work or potential extensions to nonlinear scenarios could enrich the paper.

3. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Although the paper benchmarks FPS against existing methods, a more detailed comparative analysis of why FPS outperforms specific techniques, especially the drawbacks of those methods in certain scenarios, could provide deeper insights.

4. **Parameter Sensitivity**:
   - While the authors mention the tuning of hyperparameters, it would be beneficial to see a more detailed study of how sensitive the performance of FPS is to these parameters, including the proposed noise level tuning strategy.

5. **Real-world Applications**:
   - The practical applications of the FPS method beyond the experimental setting could be better highlighted. Real-world case studies or potential use cases in specific fields (e.g., medical imaging, remote sensing) could demonstrate the method's applicability and importance.

#### Conclusion
Overall, the paper presents a compelling advancement in the field of diffusion models for solving linear inverse problems. The introduction of FPS, supported by theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence, offers a new avenue for researchers and practitioners alike. However, addressing the noted weaknesses could enhance the impact and accessibility of the work. It is recommended for acceptance, with suggestions for revision to improve clarity and broaden the discussion on potential applications and extensions.
