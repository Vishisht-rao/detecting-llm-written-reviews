## Review of "Learning to Solve Bilevel Programs with Binary Tender"

### Overall Impression
The paper presents a novel approach for solving bilevel programs (BPs) with discrete decision variables, specifically using binary tender as the linking variable between the upper and lower levels. It effectively employs deep learning techniques, particularly neural networks, to approximate the optimal value of the lower-level problem, and introduces innovative methods for enhanced sampling and a new architecture termed Input Supermodular Neural Network (ISNN). The proposed methods are validated through extensive numerical experiments, showcasing substantial improvements over state-of-the-art solvers.

### Strengths
1. **Innovative Approach**: The authors tackle a significant challenge in the optimization community—solving BPs with discrete decision variables—by leveraging neural networks and enhanced sampling techniques. The introduction of ISNN is particularly noteworthy as it guarantees supermodular mapping.

2. **Thorough Methodology**: The paper delineates a clear methodology, including the single-level reformulation of BPs, the structure and training of neural networks, and enhanced sampling procedures. Each method is presented in detail, making it easy to follow.

3. **Extensive Experiments**: The authors provide a comprehensive set of numerical experiments that include illustrative examples and randomly generated instances. The results convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods compared to existing solvers like MiBS.

4. **Clear Contributions**: The authors explicitly state their main contributions, distinguishing their work from previous studies. The comparative analysis of general and supermodular neural networks adds depth to the contribution.

5. **Practical Implications**: The applications mentioned for the proposed methods, including energy and transportation, highlight the practical relevance of the research, potentially attracting interest from various scientific and industrial domains.

### Weaknesses
1. **Theoretical Foundations**: While the empirical results are strong, the paper could benefit from a more rigorous theoretical analysis of the convergence of the proposed methods, particularly regarding the neural network training process and the implications of using supermodular constraints in optimization.

2. **Complexity Analysis**: Although the authors mention computational time and efficiency, a detailed complexity analysis comparing the proposed approach to classical algorithms would strengthen the paper's claims about its practicality.

3. **Limitations**: The paper does not thoroughly discuss any limitations or potential drawbacks of the proposed methods. Addressing potential issues, such as how the methods perform under different problem scales or types of BPs, could provide a more balanced view.

4. **Iteration and Sampling Trade-offs**: While the enhanced sampling method appears to improve sample quality, the authors should elaborate on how the trade-off between sample size and computational efficiency could impact the results, especially for larger instances.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- **Theoretical Justification**: Include a more robust theoretical justification for how the approximations made by the neural networks lead to optimal or near-optimal solutions for BPs.
  
- **Complexity Discussion**: Provide a comprehensive complexity analysis of the proposed algorithms in comparison to existing methods, elucidating how they might scale with problem size and complexity.

- **Future Work**: Discuss potential future directions where this research can be expanded, considering applications in other domains or adjustments that could handle larger and more complex BPs effectively.

- **Limitations**: Explicitly state the limitations of the techniques proposed, so readers can better understand potential scenarios where the methods may struggle or fail.

### Conclusion
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of bilevel optimization by presenting an innovative method for solving discrete bilevel problems through deep learning techniques. The extensive experimental validation supports the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Addressing the weaknesses and suggestions noted above could further enhance the paper’s clarity, rigor, and applicability, and serve to solidify its impact within the optimization community.
