**Review of "VALUE FUNCTION ESTIMATION USING CONDITIONAL DIFFUSION MODELS FOR CONTROL"**

**Overall Impression:**
The paper presents a novel approach, the Diffused Value Function (DVF), for value function estimation in offline reinforcement learning (RL) by leveraging conditional diffusion models. The motivation behind the work—addressing the scarcity of high-quality demonstrations in RL—is timely and relevant, especially given the increasing demand for large models and efficient data usage in robotics and control tasks. The proposed method shows promise in effectively utilizing low-quality data and has demonstrated competitive performance on various benchmarks. However, certain aspects of the methodology and its implications need further clarification and exploration.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty**: The introduction of diffusion models for estimating the value function and the associated decomposition of the value function into occupancy measures, rewards, and policy representations is a fresh perspective in the reinforcement learning landscape.

2. **Theoretical Foundation**: The paper grounds its methodology in well-established concepts from reinforcement learning, such as the successor representation and occupancy measures. This theoretical basis is important for the credibility of the proposed approach.

3. **Performance Results**: The experimental results on challenging robotics benchmarks, including the PyBullet suite and the Mountain Car problem, are encouraging. DVF demonstrates competitive performance against traditional offline RL baselines, which bolsters the argument for its practical utility.

4. **Handling of Complex Scenarios**: DVF’s ability to work with reward-free and action-free datasets is particularly noteworthy. This flexibility is a significant advantage over many classical methods that require richer information.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Clarity and Depth of Methodology**: While the paper outlines the DVF approach, there are parts where the details could be elaborated further. For instance, the discussion on the explicit policy conditioning and its implications could benefit from more clarity on the challenges and potential pitfalls in practical scenarios.

2. **Limitations and Trade-offs**: The authors mention limitations, such as the need for explicit policy conditioning and handling non-stationarity in online settings, but these aspects could be expanded. A more thorough analysis of the trade-offs between model complexity and performance would enhance the paper’s depth.

3. **Connection to Existing Work**: Although the authors acknowledge related works, the connection between DVF and recent advancements in offline RL or model-based approaches could be more explicitly stated. Addressing this could help clarify how DVF fits into the broader context of literature and what distinguishes it from previous methods.

4. **Quantitative Comparisons**: The quantitative comparisons with existing methods, particularly in tables and plots, should include statistical significance to strengthen claims about DVF's performance advantages. A more comprehensive ablation study could also shed light on the contribution of individual components of the DVF.

**Minor Comments:**
- The abstract could be more concise and focused on the core contributions and findings of the research.
- Some sections of the paper, particularly in the methodology, could benefit from improved organization for better flow and comprehension.
- There are some minor grammatical and typographical errors that should be corrected in the final submission.

**Conclusion:**
The paper introduces an innovative approach to value function estimation in offline reinforcement learning using conditional diffusion models. The method’s potential to utilize low-quality data effectively is a significant contribution to the field. While the paper demonstrates promising results, improvements in clarity, depth of methodological discussions, and connections to existing literature would enhance its overall impact. I encourage the authors to address the raised concerns to strengthen the submission.
