### Summary
The paper titled "Accurate and Scalable Estimation of Epistemic Uncertainty for Graph Neural Networks" presents a novel training framework, G-∆UQ, designed to enhance the intrinsic uncertainty estimates of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) under distribution shifts. It addresses the critical issue of model reliability in safety-sensitive applications where GNNs are deployed, an area that has been relatively underexplored compared to visions models. The authors build upon the concept of stochastic data centering but adapt it to the unique characteristics of graph data through innovative anchoring strategies.

### Strengths
1. **Significant Contribution**: The work highlights an important gap in existing research concerning uncertainty estimation in GNNs, particularly under distribution shifts, and offers a novel training strategy to address this.
  
2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The authors provide extensive experimental results across various datasets (WebKB, Cora, CBAS) and multiple types of distribution shifts (covariate, concept, and graph size shifts), showing the effectiveness of G-∆UQ not only in improving uncertainty estimates but also in enhancing model performance on downstream tasks.

3. **Innovative Methodology**: The adaptation of stochastic data centering to graph data through anchoring strategies is a novel approach. The paper introduces three anchoring variants (Node Feature Anchoring, Hidden Layer Anchoring, and READOUT Anchoring), contributing valuable insights into their implications for the model's stochasticity and uncertainty estimates.

4. **Improvement over Existing Methods**: The combination of G-∆UQ with post-hoc calibration methods shows that the proposed method retains flexibility and can further enhance GNN performance, solidifying its utility as both an intrinsic and viable post-hoc calibration strategy.

5. **Thorough Discussion**: The paper contains detailed discussions about design decisions, anchoring strategies, and implications for future work, providing a solid foundation for understanding the methodological choices made.

### Weaknesses
1. **Complexity of Implementation**: While the framework is promising, the requirement for advanced anchoring strategies may pose challenges for broader applicability in practice. The complexity introduced by the combinatorial nature of graph structures can make the model less accessible to practitioners without expertise in GNNs.

2. **Limited Focus on Computational Efficiency**: While the paper briefly discusses the runtime improvements achieved through the pretrained model approach, a more thorough analysis of the computational efficiency and comparison with existing methods would be valuable for practitioners concerned with scalability.

3. **Evaluative Metrics**: Although the authors present various evaluation metrics, additional qualitative analyses, such as visualizations of uncertainty estimates across different shift types, could provide deeper insights into the model behavior and performance.

4. **Comparative Analysis with State-of-the-Art**: While the authors claim improved performance with G-∆UQ, the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive comparative analysis with existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly those specifically designed for GNN uncertainty estimation. This would add context to the claimed improvements and address potential concerns over the method's relative performance.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the paper presents a significant advancement in the estimation of epistemic uncertainty for GNNs, offering a novel training framework (G-∆UQ) and demonstrating its effectiveness through extensive experimentation. The strengths of the paper largely outweigh the weaknesses, but there remain areas for further exploration and refinement, especially in terms of computational efficiency and comparative methodology. Overall, this research contributes thoughtfully to the field of GNNs and addresses a crucial issue in the deployment of machine learning models in safety-critical applications. The authors should aim for future iterations to balance innovation with accessibility and transparency in practical implementations.
