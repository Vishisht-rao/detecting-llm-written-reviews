**Review of "RESPECT THE MODEL: FINE-GRAINED AND ROBUST EXPLANATION WITH SHARING RATIO DECOMPOSITION"**

**Overview:**
The paper introduces a novel method for explainable AI (XAI) called Sharing Ratio Decomposition (SRD), aimed at improving the fidelity and robustness of explanations produced by deep learning models. The authors argue that existing explanation techniques often struggle with faithfully representing the model’s decision-making process, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. The proposed method addresses these problems by offering a decomposition of Pointwise Feature Vectors (PFVs) and emphasizes the contributions of both active and inactive neurons in forming the model's outputs.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Approach**: The introduction of SRD is an innovative approach that focuses on vector representations rather than scalar neuron values, providing a more nuanced understanding of the interactions between neurons.
  
2. **APOP Observation**: The concept of Activation-Pattern-Only Prediction (APOP) is intriguing and highlights the significant role that inactive neurons play in model decision-making. This insight could lead to a re-evaluation of how neuron activations are perceived in the context of model explanations.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The authors conduct a thorough comparative analysis demonstrating the effectiveness of SRD across various models and conditions. The use of multiple performance metrics (e.g., Pointing Game, Attribution Localization, Sparseness, Fidelity, and Stability) provides a well-rounded evaluation of their method against existing XAI techniques.

4. **Robustness Against Adversarial Attacks**: The results indicate SRD shows superior robustness in the face of adversarial perturbations, addressing a critical drawback of many existing explanation methods.

5. **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is well-organized, with clear sections outlining the methodology, experimental setup, and results. Diagrams and figures effectively illustrate the concepts being discussed.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity of Implementation**: Although the method appears promising, the complexity involved in computing the sharing ratios and effectively implementing the SRD algorithm could be a barrier for practitioners. The paper could benefit from a detailed discussion on implementation challenges and potential computational costs.

2. **Limited Real-World Validation**: While the experiments are extensive, they remain largely confined to benchmark datasets. Further validation in more diverse real-world applications could provide additional evidence of the method's efficacy and adaptability.

3. **Ambiguity in Comparison**: The discussion of existing methods sometimes lacks depth, as several key XAI techniques are mentioned but not fully dissected in relation to their drawbacks. A more detailed critique of why SRD improves upon these existing methods could strengthen the argument for its adoption.

4. **Future Work Expansion**: The future work section could elaborate on specific applications or domains where SRD could yield additional insights or improvements, particularly in fields such as healthcare or autonomous systems.

**Conclusion:**
The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of explainable artificial intelligence by introducing the SRD method for generating robust and faithfulness explanations. The experimental results support the claims made by the authors regarding the effectiveness of their approach. However, the complexities surrounding implementation and real-world applicability warrant further consideration. Overall, this work advances the conversation around XAI and poses interesting avenues for future research. 

**Recommendation**: I recommend acceptance with some revisions, particularly in providing clarity on the implementation intricacies and enhancing the comparative discussion with existing methods.
