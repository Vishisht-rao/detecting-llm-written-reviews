**Review of "Emergence of Surprise and Predictive Signals from Local Contrastive Learning"**

This paper contributes to the ongoing discourse surrounding hierarchical predictive models in cortical representations and their implications for machine learning architecture. It presents a novel and biologically plausible approach, referred to as the inverted Forward-Forward Algorithm, which utilizes local contrastive learning principles to model neural representations and interactions in hierarchical networks. 

**Strengths:**

1. **Relevance and Novelty:** The topic is highly relevant, as it tackles the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning. By revisiting the Forward-Forward model and extending its framework into a biologically plausible learning method, the authors present innovative ideas that advance understanding in both fields.

2. **Theoretical Foundation:** The paper is well-anchored in existing theories, including predictive coding and contrastive learning. The authors clearly delineate the connections and differences between their approach and existing models, providing a comprehensive context for their findings.

3. **Methodological Rigor:** The empirical investigations conducted using the MNIST dataset are robust. The results demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to reproduce hierarchical and temporal properties of predictive computations, supported by thorough quantitative analyses of layer activations and cancellation signals.

4. **Biological Plausibility:** The authors argue convincingly for the biological plausibility of their model, connecting the findings back to known neurobiological mechanisms. The discussion surrounding non-local signaling and the absence of weight transport enhances the model’s credibility and potential applicability in real-world scenarios.

5. **Falsifiability of Predictions:** The paper’s emphasis on falsifiable predictions that could be tested in neurobiological experiments is a strong advantage, as it opens avenues for empirical validation of the proposed mechanisms.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity in Understanding:** While the theoretical exposition is robust, the intricate details of the model and its mechanisms may present challenges for readers less familiar with the technical aspects of neural computation and learning paradigms. A more accessible language or streamlined explanations of certain concepts could enhance the paper's readability.

2. **Generalizability:** The framework is tested primarily on the MNIST dataset, which, while useful for illustrating the concepts, may not fully capture the complexity of real-world scenarios. Further exploration across diverse datasets and tasks would strengthen claims regarding the model's generalizability and performance.

3. **Detailed Comparisons with Predictive Coding:** Although the discussion differentiates the proposed model from predictive coding networks (PCNs), the paper could benefit from deeper exploration and explicit comparisons of performance metrics, limitations, and advantages of each approach in a wider variety of settings.

4. **Experimental Validation:** The authors propose that their model yields predictions that align with known neurobiological phenomena. However, the paper would be more compelling if it included preliminary experimental validations or collaborations with empirical neuroscience studies.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, this paper presents an insightful, innovative approach to understanding neural computation and learning via the inverted Forward-Forward model. Its emphasis on biological plausibility and empirical falsifiability positions it as a significant contribution to the field. However, the complexity of the exposition and the need for broader experimental validation should be addressed to maximize its impact. The findings have the potential to not only advance theoretical frameworks but to also inform the design of more robust machine learning systems inspired by biological processes. 

**Recommendation:** Accept with minor revisions.
