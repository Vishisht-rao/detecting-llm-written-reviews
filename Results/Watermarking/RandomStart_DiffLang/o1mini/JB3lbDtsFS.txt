### Review of "ITHAS TO BE SUBJECTIVE: HUMAN ANNOTATOR SIMULATION VIA ZERO-SHOT DENSITY ESTIMATION"

**Summary**
The paper presents a novel approach for Human Annotator Simulation (HAS) that incorporates the inherent variability found in human evaluations. The authors propose a meta-learning framework that treats HAS as a zero-shot density estimation problem. This framework enables the efficient generation of human-like annotations for unlabelled test inputs, addressing the challenges associated with collecting human annotations while ensuring a more inclusive representation of opinions. The proposed models, Conditional Integer Flows (I-CNF) and Conditional Softmax Flows (S-CNF), are evaluated across three real-world human evaluation tasks: emotion recognition, toxic speech detection, and speech quality assessment. The experimental results indicate that the proposed methods outperform various baselines in terms of prediction accuracy, distribution matching, and inter-annotator disagreement simulation.

**Strengths**
1. **Addressing a Relevant Problem**: The paper addresses an important and timely issue in machine learning — the challenge of obtaining similar levels of human-like annotations without the need for extensive human inputs. This has significant implications for the scalability and ethical use of AI systems.

2. **Comprehensive Framework**: The meta-learning approach proposed is well thought out. By framing HAS as a zero-shot density estimation problem, the authors provide a framework that is not only theoretically interesting but also practically useful for real-world applications.

3. **Experimental Validation**: The paper includes thorough experiments using multiple tasks that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The evaluation metrics are well-defined and appropriate, providing a robust assessment of model performance across different types of annotations.

4. **Innovative Model Classes**: The introduction and development of Conditional Integer Flows and Conditional Softmax Flows is a significant contribution to the body of work. The granularity with which the models account for categorical and ordinal annotations is commendable.

**Weaknesses**
1. **Clarity and Readability**: While the paper contains complex and innovative methods, at times it could benefit from more clarity. The descriptions of the mathematical formulations are dense, making it difficult for readers who might not have a strong background in this area to follow along. Consider simplifying language and providing additional diagrams for better comprehension.

2. **Comparison with Baseline Approaches**: Although the paper compares I-CNF and S-CNF with various approaches, there should be a more nuanced discussion on the advantages and limitations of these baselines. For instance, why certain models (like ensemble methods) perform drastically better than others could be elaborated on, particularly to inform the community about potential enhancements.

3. **Generality of Results**: The experiments predominantly focus on a set of specific tasks. While these tasks are relevant, broader applications or more diverse datasets could be explored to validate the generalizability of the methods.

4. **Ethical Considerations**: The ethical implications mentioned in the conclusions could be more prominently discussed throughout the paper. Although the ethics statement is present, integrating ethical considerations into the motivation and implications of the research could provide a sharper focus on responsible AI use.

**Suggestions for Improvement**
1. **Enhanced Clarity**: Consider revising complex sections for better clarity, particularly those involving advanced mathematical components. Adding flowcharts or diagrams to visualize the framework could facilitate understanding.

2. **Broader Validation**: Future work could expand on demonstrating the applicability of these models on various datasets beyond those studied in this work, to check the robustness of the findings.

3. **Ethical Context**: A stronger emphasis on ethics throughout the discussions is encouraged. This can help frame the research within the realm of responsible AI and its societal impacts.

4. **Analysis of Disagreements**: A more detailed analysis regarding the simulations of annotator disagreements and how the models accommodate varied opinions could be beneficial, ensuring that models replicate real-world complexity in human cognition.

**Conclusion**
Overall, the paper presents a significant step forward in simulating human-like annotations, providing a comprehensive approach that has clear practical implications. With improvements in clarity and breadth of evaluation, this work could serve as a seminal reference in the domain of automatic data annotation and evaluation methodologies. The authors are encouraged to consider the suggestions provided for enhancing the manuscript and ensuring that it resonates well with both technical and broader, interdisciplinary audiences.
