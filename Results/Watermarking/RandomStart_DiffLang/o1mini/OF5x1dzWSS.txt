**Review of "Doubly Robust Instance-Weighted Adversarial Training"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents a novel framework for instance-weighted adversarial training (AT) that aims to improve robustness against adversarial attacks, especially for vulnerable data points, by leveraging principles from distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and bilevel optimization. The authors highlight the limitations of existing methods, which often rely on heuristics for determining importance weights, and propose a doubly robust approach that can theoretically justify the computation of these weights. The framework is backed by a novel algorithm, called DONE (Doubly Robust Instance-Weighted Adversarial Training), which the authors claim offers significant improvements in robust performance against various attacks.

**Strengths:**
1. **Addressing Critical Limitations**: The paper accurately identifies and addresses critical issues in traditional adversarial training methods, particularly the disadvantages of heuristic-based weight selection and non-uniform robust performance across classes.
2. **Theoretical Foundation**: The approach is grounded in distributionally robust optimization principles, providing a rigorous theoretical basis for determining instance weights. This is a significant step towards establishing a sound methodology in a field often criticized for its reliance on empirical results without theoretical backing.
3. **Innovative Methodology**: The introduction of the KL-divergence regularization as part of the weight optimization process showcases a thoughtful approach to balance between uniform and worst-case weight distributions.
4. **Strong Experimental Results**: The experiments on multiple benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, SVHN, STL10, GTSRB) demonstrate that the proposed framework not only outperforms traditional AT baselines but also achieves better robustness on the least robust classes.
5. **Clear Presentation**: The paper is well-structured, clearly presenting the motivation, methodology, and results. The use of figures and tables effectively illustrates the improvements made by the proposed method over existing techniques.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Algorithm Complexity**: While the theoretical guarantees and innovations are impressive, the complexity of the proposed algorithm may limit its practical applicability, especially in resource-constrained environments. An analysis of the computational demands relative to existing methods would be beneficial for practitioners.
2. **Heuristic Comparison**: There could be a more in-depth discussion on specific heuristic methods that the proposed algorithm outperforms and why those heuristics may fail in certain contexts, helping the reader understand the advantages of the proposed method more comprehensively.
3. **Scalability**: The paper does not sufficiently address how well the proposed method scales with larger datasets or more complex models. A deeper investigation into its scalability would enhance the findings' comprehensiveness.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Include additional experiments on a wider variety of datasets, particularly in the domain of real-world applications or larger-scale datasets, to substantiate the robustness claims.
- Discuss the implications of the algorithm's computational complexity and provide insights into potential optimizations or approximations that could ease practical adoption.
- Evaluate the robustness of the proposed framework against a broader range of adversarial attacks to clarify its effectiveness across different attack scenarios.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, "Doubly Robust Instance-Weighted Adversarial Training" presents an innovative and theoretically sound approach to improving adversarial robustness, particularly for vulnerable data points. The contributions made are significant, and the results are compelling. With minor adjustments and clarifications, this work has the potential to greatly influence future research in adversarial training strategies. The paper is well-positioned for acceptance at ICLR 2024.
