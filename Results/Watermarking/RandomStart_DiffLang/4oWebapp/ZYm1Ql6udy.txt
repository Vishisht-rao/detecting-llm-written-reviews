OUTPUT:
The document focuses on the question of developing a novel Bayesian bi-clustering method that effectively fuses spatial and temporal clustering analysis of neural spiking activity derived from recent advances in neural recording technologies. The authors introduce a flexible model that captures the latent structures of neural populations based on their dynamics, allowing for the identification of both spatial (neuron clusters) and temporal (state clusters) structures concurrently.

### Strengths:

1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The paper addresses a critical challenge in neuroscienceâ€”understanding complex neural dynamics and relationships between multiple neurons. The proposed bi-clustering method is both innovative and timely, considering the increasing scale of neural data collected through modern techniques.

2. **Rigorous Statistical Approach**: The model is grounded in a robust statistical framework that employs a mixture of finite mixtures model (MFMM) and a sticky Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (sticky-HDP-HMM). This rigorous statistical grounding is essential for reliable inference in complex datasets and provides a solid methodology for further exploration in neuroscience.

3. **Validation through Simulations**: The extensive simulation studies presented in the paper validate that the proposed method can accurately recover the underlying parameters and clustering structures. This is a critical component, as it underscores the reliability and applicability of the model before applying it to real data.

4. **Broad Applicability**: The authors suggest that the method could have applications beyond neuroscience, which indicates the potential for interdisciplinary impact. By providing insights into latent structures from large-scale counting time series, the model could be beneficial in various fields.

5. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The application of the method to the Allen Institute Visual Coding Neuropixels dataset exemplifies practical application and relevance. The detailed analysis, including comparisons with other clustering methods, enriches the discussion and demonstrates the method's advantages over existing approaches.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Complexity**: One potential drawback of the proposed method is its computational complexity, especially regarding the MCMC sampling involved. While the authors acknowledge this, a clearer discussion on the trade-offs between complexity and accuracy, possibly with suggestions for computational optimizations or approximations, would benefit readers.

2. **Parameter Dependence**: Although the Bayesian framework allows for flexible model specifications, the authors specify the dimension of the latent factors and other parameters (e.g., the sticky parameter) beforehand. Addressing how they plan to handle scenarios where these assumptions may not hold true or exhibit high uncertainty would enhance the robustness of the method.

3. **Interpretability Challenges**: While the method successfully clusters spiking activity, the interpretation of found clusters in a biological context could be challenging. The authors could expand on how to translate the identified latent structures back into meaningful biological insights or interpretations.

4. **Model Extensions**: The paper discusses potential extensions, such as the incorporation of state duration or varied latent dimensions for different clusters. However, these ideas could be more thoroughly elaborated, particularly on how these might be implemented practically in future research.

### Suggestions for Improvement:

- Include a dedicated section or appendix discussing potential computational optimizations for the MCMC process.
- Expand upon how to assess and handle potential label-switching problems within the model framework. While the authors mention some strategies, a more detailed framework for addressing these challenges in practical applications would add significant value.
- Provide additional clarity on translating statistical findings into meaningful neuroscientific interpretations, with examples from the application section.

### Conclusion:

Overall, the manuscript presents a substantial contribution to the field of neuroscience by introducing a novel, Bayesian bi-clustering approach that effectively combines spatial and temporal analyses of neural data. Despite some complexities and areas for improvement in interpretability and implementation, the study's strengths and validation reinforce its potential impact in both neuroscience and broader applications in data analysis. The results reported are promising, and the method could pave the way for future studies exploring high-dimensional and complex neural datasets. It is recommended for acceptance, pending minor revisions regarding the points raised.
