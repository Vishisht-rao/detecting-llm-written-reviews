**Review of Title: ©Plug-in Market for the Text-to-Image Copyright Protection**

**Summary:**
The manuscript presents a novel framework called the ©Plug-in Market aimed at addressing copyright concerns surrounding text-to-image generative models. The authors identify a significant gap in the current landscape of AI-generated content, specifically regarding the inability of these models to properly attribute credit to original creators. They propose three primary operations—addition, extraction, and combination—that facilitate a system of credit attribution and digital copyright protection. The paper outlines technical implementations to support these operations, particularly through methods such as "inverse LoRA" and "data-free layer-wise distillation."

**Strengths:**
1. **Timeliness and Relevance:** The issue of copyright in the realm of generative AI is pressing and relevant to multiple stakeholders, including artists, developers, and legal professionals. The proposed framework addresses real-world concerns and contributes to ongoing discussions about attribution and copyright in AI-generated content.
   
2. **Conceptual Framework:** The ©Plug-in Market framework is innovative, providing a structured approach to facilitating interactions between users, content creators, and model owners. By proposing a marketplace model, the authors introduce an economic aspect that incentivizes all parties involved.

3. **Technical Contributions:** The introduction of specific methods, such as "inverse LoRA" and "data-free layer-wise distillation," demonstrates a solid understanding of the underlying technology. These methods show promise for practical implementation of the proposed operations.

4. **Experimental Validation:** The experiments conducted in the paper lend credibility to the proposed methods. The results from the extraction and combination operations are quantitatively justified through metrics like KID and LPIPS, which are appropriate for evaluating generative models.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Clarity and Organization:** While the framework is conceptually interesting, some sections of the paper are dense and could benefit from clearer explanations and a more logical flow. For instance, the transition between the introduction of the ©Plug-in Market and the technical details could be smoother.

2. **Limited Evaluation of Limitations:** The authors mention that the performance of the non-infringing model may degrade with multiple extraction operations but do not provide thorough quantitative or qualitative evaluations of this phenomenon. Addressing the practical implications of repeated operations on model performance would add depth to the analysis.

3. **Scalability Concerns:** Although the framework suggests an efficient process for adding and extracting plugins, there is limited discussion on how this system will scale as the number of plug-ins grows. The challenges associated with managing a large pool of copyrighted works could use further exploration.

4. **Potential for Misuse:** While the framework aims to protect copyrights, there is a potential concern regarding its misuse. For example, how can the system prevent deliberate circumvention of copyright laws by malicious users? A discussion on safeguarding against such misuses would strengthen the argument.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the manuscript addresses an important issue in the landscape of generative AI and presents a creative solution. With some enhancements in clarity and a more profound exploration of the challenges and limitations of the proposed framework, this paper could make a substantial contribution to the field. I recommend acceptance with revisions to address the points raised.
