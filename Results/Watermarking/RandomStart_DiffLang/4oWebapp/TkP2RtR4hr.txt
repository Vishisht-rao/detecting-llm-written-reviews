OUTPUT:
This study focuses on an important aspect of text augmentation in the natural language processing (NLP) domain: the regulation of the level of manipulation applied to data augmentation processes. Text augmentation is crucial for enhancing the diversity of training datasets, ultimately leading to more robust model performance. The authors identify a significant challenge—the balance between low-level and high-level manipulation—which can adversely affect the model’s effectiveness if not managed properly.

The authors propose a systematically adjustable text augmentation methodology that dynamically alters the manipulation level based on semantic similarity. This innovative approach demonstrates a deep understanding of how textual data can be modified effectively while maintaining the integrity of the labels assigned, which is pivotal in supervised learning contexts.

Key strengths of the paper include:

1. **Novelty**: The introduction of a systematic mechanism for adjusting the manipulation level in text augmentation represents a significant advancement in the field. The ability to control randomness based on cosine similarity between seed and candidate sentences addresses a critical research gap.

2. **Robust Methodology**: The experimental setup is comprehensive, comparing the proposed method against various existing augmentation techniques across multiple datasets (IMDB, SEM-Eval17, YELP). The use of advanced techniques like sentence and document embeddings and XAI for pseudo-labeling adds depth to the findings.

3. **Performance Validation**: The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches, with notable performance improvements. The metrics provided are thorough, offering a clear picture of the effectiveness of the methodology under different conditions.

4. **Detailed Analysis**: The inclusion of an ablation study highlights the impact of hyperparameters on performance, displaying a thoughtful approach to experimental rigor and parameter tuning.

5. **Clarity of Writing**: The manuscript is well-structured and generally clear, with a logical flow from the introduction to the conclusion. Diagrams and tables are effectively used to supplement the textual content, aiding reader comprehension.

However, there are a few areas where the paper could be improved:

1. **Limitations and Future Work**: While the authors acknowledge some limitations of their proposed methods, such as challenges with augmenting single-sentence datasets and the need for tailored equations, a deeper exploration of these limitations could provide valuable insights. Furthermore, elaborating on potential future research avenues could inspire further developments in this area.

2. **Detail on Advanced Techniques**: Although the sentence-embedding approach combines contextual information, a more granular explanation of how XAI values are integrated and their specific impact on sentiment labeling could strengthen the methodology section.

3. **Real-World Application**: The practical applications of the work could be elaborated further. Providing examples of real-world scenarios where the proposed approach could be implemented would help to ground the research in practical terms.

4. **Statistical Analysis**: While the casual comparisons of performance are compelling, a more detailed statistical analysis (e.g., significance testing) could substantiate the claims of improvement over baseline methods.

In conclusion, this paper presents a noteworthy contribution to the field of text augmentation within NLP, leveraging systematic approaches to tackle manipulation levels that impact model training. Overall, the work stands to benefit both academic inquiries and practical applications in deploying NLP systems that require robust data enrichment techniques. I recommend this paper for acceptance, provided that the authors consider the feedback provided here to enhance their work further.
