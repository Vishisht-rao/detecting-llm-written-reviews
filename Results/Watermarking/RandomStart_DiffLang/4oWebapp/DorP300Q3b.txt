## Review of "Learning Pseudo 3D Representation for Ego-Centric 2D Multiple Object Tracking"

**Context:**
The paper addresses a critical issue in the realm of Multiple Object Tracking (MOT), specifically focusing on the significant challenges presented by object occlusion in 2D tracking tasks. By leveraging 3D object representations derived from video data, it proposes a novel 2D MOT framework named P3DTrack that aims to enhance the robustness of object tracking in congested environments.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach**: The paper introduces a novel method to generate pseudo 3D object labels from monocular video clips by employing Structure-from-Motion (SfM) techniques. This innovation offers a fresh perspective on solving the 2D MOT problem without the need for expensive 3D sensors like LiDAR or additional annotations.

2. **Joint Optimization**: The proposed framework allows for the joint learning of 3D object representations alongside the object association module, which is a commendable advance over traditional approaches that kept these tasks separate. This joint optimization strategy is likely to improve overall performance in tracking accuracy.

3. **Performance Benchmarking**: The authors provide a comprehensive evaluation of their method across multiple ego-centric datasets (KITTI and Waymo Open Dataset). Their results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, showcasing the effectiveness of their approach compared to existing methodologies. The inclusion of exhaustive ablation studies further strengthens the claims by validating individual components of their proposed architecture.

4. **Clear Presentation**: The paper is well-structured with clear sections delineating the motivation, methodology, experiments, and results. Figures and tables complement the text effectively, facilitating easier comprehension of the complex concepts and results.

5. **Practical Significance**: The methodology provides a practical solution that eliminates the dependency on manually annotated data and pre-trained depth models, making it a potentially valuable contribution to the field of Computer Vision, particularly in applications for autonomous driving and surveillance.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limitations in Depth Estimation**: The authors acknowledge the limitations of their approach, particularly concerning the accuracy of the learned 3D location for objects, especially at greater distances. While this is an expected challenge in monocular depth estimation, the paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion regarding prospective solutions or improvements.

2. **Generalization to Dynamic Objects**: The paperâ€™s focus on static objects for pseudo 3D label generation results in limitations when dealing with dynamic objects, which the authors mention could hamper the effectiveness of tracking in scenarios where objects move in various directions or speeds. Future work may need to include adaptive mechanisms to refine object representations when motion is involved.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: While the results show improvements over current state-of-the-art methods, the paper could enhance its impact by providing a more detailed analysis of failures and edge cases, including specific scenarios where the proposed method underperformed.

4. **Experimental Setup Details**: Although the paper does provide some details on the experimental setup, there are opportunities for further clarification, particularly in describing the data preprocessing steps and the training procedure, to ensure reproducibility.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a compelling contribution to the field of multiple object tracking by effectively addressing key challenges associated with data association in 2D environments. By introducing P3DTrack and demonstrating its efficiency in recognizing and tracking objects through the utilization of pseudo 3D labels, the authors set a solid foundation for further research in this domain. 

With some deeper exploration of the highlighted weaknesses and a more detailed comparative analysis, the work could achieve an even greater impact. Nevertheless, it is a significant advancement towards more robust and practical solutions for real-world applications in object tracking. 

**Recommendation**: Accept with minor revisions.
