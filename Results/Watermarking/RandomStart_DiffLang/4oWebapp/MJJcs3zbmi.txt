**Review of "Discovering Temporally-Aware Reinforcement Learning Algorithms"**

This article explores a significant and timely question in the field of reinforcement learning (RL): how can we develop more expressive, temporally-aware RL algorithms that adapt their learning objectives over the course of training? The authors successfully advance this discussion by proposing modifications to existing meta-learning frameworks (specifically, Learned Policy Gradient and Learned Policy Optimization) to include dynamic objective functions that consider the remaining training horizon. 

### Strengths:
1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The paper presents a compelling contribution to the field of meta-learning and RL by addressing the often-overlooked aspect of training time horizon in the optimization processes. By introducing temporally-aware variants of existing algorithms, the authors delve into fundamental principles of learning that could closely emulate human learning practices.

2. **Methodological Rigor**: The authors implement a systematic approach to augment two established methods (TA-LPG and TA-LPO) with temporal information. The use of evolution strategies for meta-optimization is well-justified, especially in light of the limitations associated with backpropagation in gradient-based approaches, lending credibility to their findings.

3. **Extensive Experiments**: The experiments are comprehensive and convincingly illustrate the benefits of temporally-awareness across various tasks, including both continuous control and discrete settings. The results demonstrate clear improvements in generalization to out-of-distribution environments and training horizons, supporting the authors' claims about the effective trade-off between exploration and exploitation.

4. **Interesting Insights**: The analysis provided on the adaptive behavior of the learned algorithms further adds depth to the paper. The observation of changing strategies from optimism to pessimism throughout training offers valuable insights into the learned policies that could foster further research on adaptive learning schemes.

### Weaknesses:
1. **Theoretical Justification**: While the paper does a commendable job presenting empirical results, there is a lack of deeper theoretical exploration surrounding the proposed methods. A more rigorous theoretical framework supporting the concepts of temporal adaptation would strengthen the paper, as current meta-learning approaches often benefit from robust theoretical underpinnings.

2. **Limitations and Future Work**: The authors briefly mention limitations regarding the robustness of the discovered algorithms but could have provided a more thorough discussion on potential pitfalls and how these might be addressed in future iterations of their work. This could help delineate the boundaries and applicability of their findings.

3. **Complexity of Implementation**: While the proposed method provides substantial improvements, it may also introduce additional complexity which could make it less accessible for practitioners. Future work could explore streamlining these approaches or providing clearer guidelines for implementation.

### Conclusion:
Overall, "Discovering Temporally-Aware Reinforcement Learning Algorithms" represents a meaningful advancement in the ongoing research endeavor to automate the discovery of effective RL algorithms. By successfully integrating temporal awareness into learned objectives, the authors not only enhance the expressivity of RL models but also open up new avenues for research in both RL and meta-learning. I recommend acceptance of this paper with minor revisions to address the theoretical aspects and implications of the findings more thoroughly.
