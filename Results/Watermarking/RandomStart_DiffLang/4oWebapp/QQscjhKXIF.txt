OUTPUT:
This study examines an important domain in machine learning, focusing on the intersection of class-incremental continual learning (CICL) and multi-view clustering (MVC). The authors introduce a novel approach, Class-incremental Continual Multi-View Clustering (CCMVC), which aims to address the challenges posed by the growing complexity of data in contemporary applications, particularly in scenarios where classes incrementally emerge over time.

### Strengths:

1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The paper fills a significant gap in the literature by exploring CICL in the context of MVC. The proposal of CCMVC as the first method to tackle this specific problem is a strong contribution to the field.

2. **Comprehensive Methodology**: The authors detail a well-structured framework for their algorithm, consisting of two main phases: multi-view cluster search and multi-view cluster consolidation. This dual-phase design allows for effective integration of new data while preserving previously acquired knowledge, a crucial aspect in continual learning.

3. **Innovative Loss Functions**: The introduction of a cross-view synchronous loss to balance learning across different views is particularly noteworthy. Given the inherent challenges of asynchronous convergence in multi-view learning, this approach is theoretically and empirically justified and effectively mitigates discrepancies between views during training.

4. **Thorough Experiments**: The authors conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the efficacy of CCMVC compared to state-of-the-art methods for both MVC and continual learning. The presented results convincingly illustrate the advantages of their proposed approach in critical metrics such as class incremental accuracy.

5. **Ablation Studies**: The ablation studies effectively elucidate the contribution of each component of the proposed method, confirming their relevance in improving performance. This enhances the paper's credibility by showcasing the systematic evaluation of its components.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Clarity and Detail**: While the methodology is sound, certain sections, particularly in the description of complex algorithms and loss functions, could benefit from clearer exposition. Lay readers or those less familiar with the field might struggle to grasp all technical details without additional context or motivation for certain choices.

2. **Comparison with Joint Training**: Although Joint Training is mentioned as an upper bound for performance, the paper would benefit from a more explicit comparison, perhaps highlighting the specific contexts where continual learning approaches might outperform static methods, beyond just performance metrics.

3. **Impact of Hyperparameters**: The analysis of hyperparameter sensitivity, while included, could be expanded with a more robust discussion on how different configurations could impact the model's performance. Clearer guidelines or recommendations based on experimental findings might assist practitioners and researchers in implementing the proposed method.

4. **Broader Implications**: Although the paper focuses on the technical advancement introduced by CCMVC, a discussion of the broader implications of this work—such as potential applications in real-world scenarios or future research directions—would enrich the narrative and provide context for its significance.

### Overall Impression:

This paper presents a significant advancement in the field of machine learning by addressing the critical issue of continual learning in multi-view clustering contexts. The proposed method, CCMVC, along with its loss functions and training strategies, showcases promise and effectiveness in managing incremental class learning from multi-view data. Despite minor issues with clarity and broader context, the authors provide a thorough and empirically validated examination of their approach. I recommend acceptance to ICLR 2024, with the expectation that the authors refine their exposition in the final version.
