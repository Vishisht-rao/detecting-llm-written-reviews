OUTPUT:
This paper examines a critical issue in the realm of digital media authenticity: the robustness of watermarking techniques against adaptive attacks, particularly in the context of deepfakes generated by models like Stable Diffusion. The authors systematically propose a method to assess and evaluate the resilience of various watermarking algorithms against adaptive attackers, utilizing optimization techniques that allow for a streamlined and efficient approach to breaking watermark detection at minimal perceptual impact on the images.

### Strengths:

1. **Novel Approach**: The paper's approach to framing adaptive attacks as an optimization problem is a significant advancement in the field. By generating surrogate keys that are differentiable, the authors provide a systematic and replicable method for evaluating the robustness of watermarking algorithms. This perspective can lead to a deeper understanding of watermark vulnerabilities.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The evaluation of five different watermarking methods (TRW, WDM, DWT, DWT-SVD, and RivaGAN) across multiple attacks offers a thorough examination of current practices in watermarking for image generators. The results provide vital insights that could influence future research and designs of watermarking technologies.

3. **Clear Experimental Design**: The authors employ a well-structured experimental setup, including quantitative metrics such as True Positive Rate (TPR@1%FPR), Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), and CLIP scores. This clarity aids in accurately assessing the performance of their proposed adaptive attacks versus established watermarking techniques.

4. **Real-World Relevance**: The findings underline the importance of evaluating watermarking algorithms with respect to real-world misuse scenarios, especially concerning the prevalence of harmful deepfake technologies. By demonstrating that all surveyed watermarking methods can be effectively compromised, the paper highlights the pressing need for advancements in watermarking robustness.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Limited Scope of Experimentation**: While the five watermarking methods evaluated provide a good overview, the findings might benefit from broader experimentation with an even wider range of watermarking techniques. This would better reflect the diversity of current methods in watermarking practices.

2. **Assumptions on Attacker Capabilities**: The paper assumes that attackers will have perfect access to a surrogate generator and can optimize their attacks effectively. However, in real-world situations, attackers might face constraints that could affect their efficiency. More discussion on the generalizability of the findings would enhance reader understanding.

3. **Ethical Considerations**: The discussion on the ethical implications of watermarking and the potential misuse of the proposed techniques is somewhat lacking. While the authors do mention the ethical responsibility they bear as researchers, a more in-depth contemplation of the implications of their findings, particularly in combatting disinformation, would strengthen the paper’s impact.

### Conclusion:
In summary, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the understanding of watermarking robustness against adaptive attacks in the context of deepfake technology. The authors' innovative approach and comprehensive evaluation provide crucial insights into the current limitations of watermarking practices in AI-generated imagery. However, addressing the aforementioned weaknesses, particularly regarding the broader applicability of findings and ethical considerations, could enhance the paper's overall quality and relevance in shaping future research directions.
