**Review of "Self-Guided Masked Autoencoders for Domain-Agnostic Self-Supervised Learning" by Johnathan Xie et al.**

The document examines the key aspect of developing a domain-agnostic self-supervised learning method called Self-Guided Masked Autoencoders (SMA). This approach aims to address the challenges faced by existing self-supervised learning techniques that rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge and prespecified augmentation strategies. By leveraging a masking technique guided by the model's own attention maps, the authors propose a viable alternative that is not only domain-agnostic but also demonstrates strong performance across diverse scientific domains such as protein biology, chemical property prediction, and particle physics.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Contribution**: The introduction of Self-Guided Masked Autoencoders represents a significant contribution to the field of self-supervised learning. The authors successfully demonstrate that representation learning can be executed without the constraints of domain-specific knowledge and tokenization methods. This aspect is particularly crucial for applications in scientific domains where domain knowledge may be scarce or not well-defined.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The experimental results are extensive and offer a solid evaluation of the proposed method against state-of-the-art methods in multiple domains. The researchers have taken care to compare SMA with both domain-specific approaches and alternative self-supervised methods, reinforcing the effectiveness of their approach.

3. **Technical Rigor**: The methodology is well-articulated, and the authors provide a detailed explanation of the attentional mechanisms used to generate masks. The easing of computational complexity in the masking process, along with a clear explanation of the iterative procedures involved in generating attention maps, contributes to the paper’s technical depth.

4. **Robust Performance**: The results presented across various benchmarks indicate that SMA achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining domain agnosticism. This combination is particularly useful for advancing self-supervised learning techniques in various applications.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Analysis of Failure Cases**: While the authors showcase strong performance metrics, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of failure cases or conditions under which SMA might not perform as well. Understanding these limitations would provide a more balanced view of the proposed methodology.

2. **Scalability Considerations**: Although the authors mention the efficiency improvements in computing the masks, there is limited discussion on how well SMA scales with extremely large datasets or particularly high-dimensional inputs. Future work could explore the implications of scaling up the model and computational requirements.

3. **Exploration of Variability in Masks**: While the visualization of learned masks in images demonstrates clustering behavior, the authors do not explore the variability in generated masks in both text and image tasks in depth. More qualitative insights into how the generated masks affect the learning process and final representations could enrich the understanding of the method’s performance.

**Conclusion**: 

Overall, this paper presents a compelling advancement in the self-supervised learning landscape, effectively addressing the limitations of existing methods through the introduction of SMA. The robust experimental results and sound methodology affirm its potential applicability in various domains, especially in scientific fields. While there are areas for deeper exploration regarding limitations, scalability, and mask variability, the contributions made in this work are significant and should stimulate further research on domain-agnostic self-supervised learning models. The authors are encouraged to continue refining their approach and consider addressing the identified weaknesses in subsequent iterations of their research. 

**Recommendation:** Strongly consider acceptance for presentation at ICLR 2024 due to its novelty, methodological contributions, and empirical validation.
