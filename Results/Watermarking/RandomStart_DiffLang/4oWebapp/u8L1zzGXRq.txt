**Review of the Paper: "Impact of Molecular Representations on Deep Learning Model Comparisons in Drug Response Predictions"**

The study explores the region of deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) methodologies applied to drug response prediction (DRP) in cancer research. It addresses an important challenge in the field: the inconsistency in benchmarks and the variability in molecular representations, which can affect the performance and comparability of different models. The authors present the CoMParison workflow for Cross Validation (CMP-CV), an automated framework designed to standardize comparisons of various drug representations and models.

**Strengths:**

1. **Relevance and Timeliness**: The paper responds to a pressing need in cancer research, especially the significant challenge of predicting drug response accurately using various molecular representations. This is particularly pertinent as the field continues to grow in complexity.

2. **Methodological Innovation**: The introduction of the CMP-CV framework is a substantial contribution. The ability to standardize model comparisons and vary hyperparameters systematically allows for robust analyses that can lead to more reproducible and interpretable results.

3. **Benchmarking Variety of Representations**: The authors provide a thorough evaluation of multiple molecular representations (graphs, SMILES, Morgan fingerprints, and molecular descriptors). Their comprehensive approach to benchmarking these representations on model performance is commendable and offers valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each.

4. **Detailed Results and Analysis**: The results section presents compelling findings regarding the performance of molecular representations across different descriptor domains, particularly noting the varying accuracy and prediction errors. The segmentation of descriptor domains is a useful approach to understanding model limitations and strengths.

5. **User-Centric Application**: The development of a web application allowing users to adjust molecular descriptors and find the corresponding best-performing models demonstrates the practical applications of the research, enhancing user experience and model accessibility.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Clarity of Objectives**: While the study presents a sophisticated methodology, the initial objectives could be articulated with greater clarity. Clearly stated hypotheses or questions guiding the research would enhance the overall narrative and focus.

2. **Discussion Depth**: Although the authors provide insights into the implications of their findings, the discussion could benefit from a deeper exploration of how their results align with or challenge existing literature. Comparing their findings with those in prior studies could contextualize the impact of their results.

3. **Limitations and Future Work**: The paper lacks a detailed critical assessment of its limitations. While the authors touch on the potential shortcomings of molecular representations, a more explicit acknowledgment of these limitations, along with suggestions for future research in this area, would strengthen the conclusion.

4. **Statistical Analysis**: Providing more detailed statistical analyses (e.g., significance tests or confidence intervals) of the differences in model performance across representations could further solidify the credibility of the findings.

5. **References and Contextualization**: The references used are extensive, but further contextualizing some of the cited works would help streamline the narrative. Clarifying why certain studies are relevant to this research would benefit readers less familiar with the topic.

In conclusion, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of cancer drug response prediction, particularly through the development and application of the CMP-CV framework and the evaluation of molecular representations. By addressing the aforementioned areas for improvement, the authors can enhance the depth and clarity of their work, further establishing its relevance in ongoing research efforts in this vital area. 

**Recommendation**: Accept with minor revisions.
