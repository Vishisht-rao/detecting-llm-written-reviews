**Review of "RepCodec: A Speech Representation Codec for Speech Tokenization"**

**Summary**:  
The paper presents RepCodec, an innovative method for semantic speech tokenization aimed at improving information retention in discrete speech representations, addressing the challenges associated with existing methods such as k-means clustering. The proposed architecture integrates a codec encoder, a vector quantization module, and a decoder, allowing for a more efficient conversion of continuous speech waveforms into semantic tokens. The authors claim that RepCodec outperforms k-means and other methods across various downstream tasks, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech generation.

**Strengths**:
1. **Relevance and Novelty**: The topic is highly relevant given the growing intersection of speech processing and large language models (LLMs). The proposed approach is novel and addresses a significant challenge in the field: the loss of semantic information due to discretization.
  
2. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The authors conduct extensive experiments utilizing multiple speech encoders and languages, demonstrating RepCodec's robustness and adaptability. The quantitative results supporting the claims of improved performance are well-presented, particularly in tables that compare word error rates (WER) across various methods.

3. **Detailed Methodology**: The paper provides a thorough description of the RepCodec architecture, including the encoder, decoder, and vector quantizer components. The detailed explanation of the training objectives and optimization strategies enhances the reproducibility of the study.

4. **Insightful Findings**: The analysis of the relationship between PNMI (Phone-Normalized Mutual Information), reconstruction loss, and WER adds depth to the findings. The authors effectively argue that retaining information is critical for performance, which is a valuable insight for future research in this area.

**Weaknesses**:
1. **Complexity and Clarity**: While the paper covers intricate technical details, some sections are dense, which may hinder understanding for readers less familiar with the topic. Simplifying the language in some parts or including more illustrative diagrams could enhance clarity.

2. **Comparison with Supervisory Methods**: While the authors highlight the advantages of RepCodec over unsupervised methods like k-means, a more nuanced discussion on how RepCodec compares with supervised methods (e.g., ASR or phoneme recognition) in various contexts would enrich the analysis. It would be helpful to clarify under which circumstances RepCodec might be preferred over these methods.

3. **Computational Efficiency**: The paper mentions the improved performance of RepCodec but could better address computational efficiency and scalability considering practical implementation in real-world scenarios. An analysis of computational costs in comparison to existing methods would be valuable.

4. **Future Work**: Although the paper touches upon potential future directions, including refining semantic tokens for other tasks, it lacks a clear roadmap or specific proposals for advancing the method beyond the immediate findings presented.

**Conclusion**:  
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to speech representation coding and tokenization. The proposed RepCodec method shows promise in improving semantic information retention, which is crucial for downstream tasks involving speech. Addressing the noted weaknesses could enhance the manuscript's clarity and comprehensiveness, further solidifying its impact on the research community. Recommended for acceptance pending minor revisions to enhance clarity and detail in comparisons with existing methods.
