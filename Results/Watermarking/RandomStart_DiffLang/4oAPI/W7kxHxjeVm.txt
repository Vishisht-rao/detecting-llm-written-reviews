**Review of "IMAD: A NEND-TO-END METHOD FOR UNSUPERVISED ANOMALY DETECTION IN THE PRESENCE OF MISSING VALUES"**

**Summary**
The paper presents a novel method called IMAD (Imputation and Detection) for unsupervised anomaly detection in datasets with missing values. The authors argue that conventional techniques often fail in the presence of missing data, which is a prevalent issue in real-world applications. They propose to integrate data imputation and anomaly detection into a unified optimization framework while simultaneously addressing the imputation bias that typically arises when using an "impute-then-detect" strategy.

**Strengths**
1. **Relevance and Importance**: The problem of anomaly detection with missing values is significant in various applications, including healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity. The proposed method aims to fill a gap in the literature, where existing approaches often dismiss incomplete data.

2. **Novelty**: The introduction of pseudo-abnormal samples generated during the training process represents a novel way to enhance both imputation and detection tasks. This strategy seems to contribute positively to addressing the fundamental issues of imputation bias.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The authors conduct thorough experimental evaluations across seven real-world datasets considering different missing mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR). The method is compared against several state-of-the-art baseline approaches, and the results demonstrate significant improvements.

4. **Promising Results**: The experimental results show that IMAD consistently outperforms the baseline methods, providing evidence that the proposed approach can effectively alleviate imputation bias while maintaining strong anomaly detection performance.

**Weaknesses**
1. **Clarity and Readability**: Although the paper is dense with information, some sections, particularly the technical explanation of the proposed method, could be more clearly articulated. More intuitive visuals or explanations could help clarify the contribution in generating pseudo-abnormal samples.

2. **Complexity of the Model**: While the authors discuss the integration of imputation and anomaly detection, the mechanics of this integration may be complex for practical implementation. A more concrete discussion on efficiency, runtime considerations, and scalability in practice would be beneficial.

3. **Limitations and Assumptions**: The authors briefly mention various assumptions related to the distributions used in the model. A more thorough discussion of the limitations, especially under varying circumstances in real-world datasets, would strengthen the analysis and provide clarity around the robustness of IMAD under diverse conditions.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**: While the paper focuses on AUROC and AUPRC for performance evaluation, the authors could consider additional metrics, such as F1 score or confusion matrix analyses, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets. This would provide a more comprehensive view of the detection capability.

**Suggestions for Improvement**
1. **Clarification of Methodology**: Include more high-level summaries or intuitive examples that could help guide readers through the methodology.
   
2. **Real-world Applications**: Discuss potential applications in real-world scenarios in greater detail, particularly how IMAD can be integrated into existing systems or workflows.

3. **Alternative Evaluation**: Incorporate additional performance metrics and analyses to provide a more robust evaluation of IMAD's practical utility and performance under varying conditions.

**Conclusion**
Overall, the paper effectively addresses a critical issue in anomaly detection with missing data and proposes a compelling solution with IMAD. With minor improvements in clarity, methodological exposition, and a more detailed discussion on implementation and limitations, this work could significantly impact the field of unsupervised anomaly detection. The findings demonstrate promise and highlight the importance of addressing imputation bias, contributing valuable insights to both academic and industry practices.
