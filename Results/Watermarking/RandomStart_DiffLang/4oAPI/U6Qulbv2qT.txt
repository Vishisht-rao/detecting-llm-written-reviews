### Review of "Provable Benefits of Multi-task RL Under Non-Markovian Decision Making Processes"

#### Summary:
The authors investigate the advantages of multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) in the context of non-Markovian decision-making processes, particularly focusing on predictive state representations (PSRs). The paper establishes theoretical foundations regarding how shared latent structures in multiple tasks can enhance sample efficiency compared to single-task learning. The work presents a new algorithm, UMT-PSR, for upstream multi-task learning and a framework for downstream transfer learning, highlighting notable theoretical results concerning the η-bracketing number, which measures model complexity.

#### Strengths:
1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The paper addresses an essential gap in reinforcement learning, extending the benefits of multi-task learning beyond Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to more complex settings. The focus on non-Markovian decision-making processes and predictive state representations is timely and relevant, given the increasing complexity of real-world scenarios.

2. **Theoretical Contributions**: The introduction of the η-bracketing number as a metric for capturing task similarity and its influence on model complexity is a significant theoretical contribution. This metric allows for a deeper understanding of when and why multi-task learning benefits occur.

3. **Clarity of Contributions**: The authors clearly delineate their main contributions, offering a comprehensive overview of their findings, particularly how the UMT-PSR algorithm employs confidence set construction based on bracketing numbers.

4. **Algorithmic Advances**: The proposed UMT-PSR algorithm is well-articulated and shows promise in improving sample efficiency through its design choices, including pairwise additive distance-based planning.

5. **Illustrative Examples**: The paper includes concrete examples that illustrate the theoretical results, demonstrating scenarios where the η-bracketing number is low, effectively showcasing the practical relevance of the theoretical concepts.

#### Weaknesses:
1. **Complexity of Results**: While the theoretical results are interesting, the complexity of the mathematical framework may pose challenges for readers unfamiliar with advanced statistical learning theory. A more intuitive explanation of core concepts could enhance accessibility.

2. **Experimental Validation**: The paper primarily focuses on theoretical foundations, and there is limited empirical validation of the proposed algorithm. Including experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of UMT-PSR in practice would strengthen the paper's claims and showcase its practical implications.

3. **Broader Applicability**: The focus on specific forms of PSRs and low-rank decision-making problems might limit the generalizability of the findings. Addressing how the results could extend to more general classes of problems would be beneficial.

4. **Technical Depth**: Certain sections, particularly in the derivations of theoretical results, may need simplification or clearer exposition for broader readership clarity. More thorough explanations of concepts like Ŕenyi divergence and its role in the context of the results would be helpful.

5. **Comparison with Existing Work**: While relevant literature is cited, a more detailed critique or comparison with previous similar works could better situate the contributions of this paper within the existing landscape of reinforcement learning research.

#### Suggestions for Improvement:
- Consider enhancing the introduction and conclusion with broader implications of the research findings in practical applications.
- Incorporate empirical validation to support the theoretical claims, possibly in the form of experimental comparisons of UMT-PSR with existing algorithms.
- Provide a more accessible explanation of the theory and core concepts, perhaps through additional visual aids or simplified examples.

#### Overall Impression:
This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning, addressing a critical gap by exploring multi-task learning in non-Markovian settings. The theoretical insights presented are valuable, and the proposed algorithm holds promise. However, the addition of empirical validation and clearer communication of complex concepts would further enhance its impact and accessibility. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address these areas.
