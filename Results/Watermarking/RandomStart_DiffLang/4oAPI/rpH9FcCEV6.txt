**Review of "An Efficient Membership Inference Attack for the Diffusion Model by Proximal Initialization"**

**Summary**
The paper presents a novel query-based membership inference attack (MIA) method called Proximal Initialization Attack (PIA), focused on the vulnerabilities of diffusion models to privacy attacks. Given recent advancements in diffusion models and their application in generating both images and audio, the authors specifically address the issue of membership inference, which aims to determine if a given data sample was part of the model's training set. This work builds upon previous methods with a focus on efficiency—claiming PIA is significantly more effective than previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, requiring only two queries to achieve competitive results in both image and audio generation tasks.

**Strengths**
1. **Relevance**: The paper addresses a critical and timely issue, as generative models like diffusion models proliferate in various applications that may involve sensitive or copyrighted information.
2. **Novelty**: The proposed PIA method introduces an innovative approach to leverage the initialization state for attacks, presenting a shift from traditional methods that depend heavily on direct metrics of training loss.
3. **Performance**: Empirical results demonstrate that PIA not only operates substantially faster than previous models (e.g., SecMI), but also matches or exceeds their attack performance in terms of key metrics like true positive rate (TPR) and area under the curve (AUC).
4. **Broad Applicability**: The method is tested across multiple datasets and models, establishing robustness in different contexts within both image and audio domains.
5. **Open Source**: Availability of the code is a commendable aspect that facilitates reproducibility and further exploration by other researchers.

**Weaknesses**
1. **Limited Exploration of Countermeasures**: While the paper focuses on constructing an effective attack, there is little discussion on potential ways to mitigate or counteract these membership inference attacks. Addressing countermeasures would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the implications of the research.
2. **Technical Clarity**: Some sections, particularly in the methodology and mathematical proofs, may be challenging to follow for readers who are not deeply familiar with the underlying principles of diffusion models or MIAs. A clearer exposition or additional visual aids to explain the process could enhance accessibility.
3. **Generalizability Concerns**: Although the results indicate better performance across some datasets, the paper could benefit from a broader evaluation of different model types, particularly those that may not be as amenable to the proposed attack strategy.
4. **Comparative Analysis Depth**: While comparisons with related works such as Matsumoto et al. (2023) and Duan et al. (2023) are presented, a deeper analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of different attack models beyond raw performance metrics may enrich the discussion.

**Minor Points**
- The paper occasionally rehashes concepts that could have been stated more succinctly. Streamlining the writing would enhance readability.
- Minor typographical errors and formatting inconsistencies are present but do not detract significantly from the overall contribution.

**Conclusion**
Overall, the paper makes an important contribution to the ongoing dialogue surrounding privacy concerns in generative modeling, demonstrating a novel approach to membership inference attacks through the PIA method. The empirical findings underscore its practical implications while highlighting the need for continued exploration of defenses against such vulnerabilities. With revisions targeting clarity and depth of analysis, this work has the potential to be an impactful addition to the field at ICLR 2024.
