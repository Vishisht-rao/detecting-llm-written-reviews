### Review of the Paper: "DOMODELS EXPLAIN THEMSELVES ? COUNTERFACTUAL SIMULATABILITY OF NATURAL LANGUAGE EXPLANATIONS"

#### Overview
The paper presents a novel approach to evaluating how well large language models (LLMs) can provide explanations that help humans understand their decision-making processes through the concept of counterfactual simulatability. The authors introduce two metrics—precision and generality—to assess the effectiveness of natural language explanations in enabling users to infer model responses to counterfactual scenarios. The focus on how explanations can mislead users is particularly relevant given the increasing deployment of LLMs across various sensitive domains.

#### Strengths
1. **Timeliness and Importance**: The topic is highly relevant, as interpretability in AI is a growing concern, particularly with LLMs that often give modal answers without clear rationale. The paper addresses a critical gap by evaluating explanations through the lens of their impact on human understanding.

2. **Clear Problem Statement**: The authors clearly articulate the essential questions of whether LLMs can effectively explain their decisions and whether these explanations help users build accurate mental models. This sets a solid foundation for the study.

3. **Innovative Metrics**: The introduction of the precision and generality metrics provides a quantitative framework for evaluating explanations. The metrics are well-defined and contribute significantly to the existing literature on explainability.

4. **Robust Methodology**: The use of human evaluation combined with automatic generation of counterfactuals using LLMs presents a comprehensive approach. Benchmarking the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on multi-hop factual reasoning and reward modeling adds depth to the empirical results.

5. **Insights on Optimization Challenges**: The finding that precision does not correlate with plausibility suggests that simply optimizing for human preferences may not lead to better explanations. This nuance is valuable for future work in the field.

#### Areas for Improvement
1. **Theoretical Grounding**: Although the paper presents practical metrics, it could benefit from deeper theoretical insights into why certain explanations fail or succeed in the context of human reasoning. Additional discussion on cognitive biases that may affect how humans interpret these explanations could strengthen the paper.

2. **Broader Range of Models**: The reliance on only two LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) may limit the generalizability of the findings. Including a broader array of models or architectures would provide a more comprehensive view of the simulatability of explanations across different AI systems.

3. **Human Annotation Variability**: The paper mentions variability in human annotations, resulting in moderate inter-annotator agreement. While this is an inherent challenge in subjective evaluations, further strategies to mitigate this could improve reliability.

4. **Clarification of Practical Implications**: While the paper discusses the importance of building accurate mental models, it could elaborately outline practical recommendations for developers of LLMs regarding how to improve the quality of explanations based on the findings.

5. **Experimental Detail**: Some sections, particularly regarding the human simulation evaluation and the specific tasks used for benchmarking, lack detailed disclosures that could allow for reproducibility. Providing more explicit descriptions of these processes would strengthen the paper's contributions.

#### Conclusion
Overall, this paper offers a compelling analysis of LLMs' explanatory capabilities from a unique perspective. It introduces valuable metrics and demonstrates that the current state of LLM explanations can lead to misinterpretations by users. By addressing the aforementioned areas for improvement, the work could enrich the discourse on AI explainability and potentially lead to practical guidelines for enhancing LLM training and deployment. 

The findings have important implications for future AI systems, particularly those deployed in sensitive domains where understanding model reasoning is crucial. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions that address the stated concerns.
