OUTPUT:
**Review of "HOW MANY VIEWS DOES YOUR DEEP NEURAL NETWORK USE FOR PREDICTION?"**

**Overall Assessment:**
The paper presents a novel approach called Minimal Sufficient Views (MSVs) to understand and estimate the features used by deep neural networks (DNNs) in predictive tasks, specifically by allowing for a multi-view perspective similar to that presented by Allen-Zhu & Li (2023). The authors provide a formal definition of MSVs alongside an efficient greedy algorithm to compute them, supported by comprehensive empirical results.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Contribution**: The concept of Minimal Sufficient Views is an important contribution to the field, as it seeks to address a gap in existing literature regarding the understanding of DNN generalization, especially concerning non-ensemble and non-distilled models. This addresses a crucial aspect of modern AI systems—interpretability and understanding of model decisions.

2. **Empirical Validation**: The paper provides extensive empirical results across various state-of-the-art DNN architectures, showcasing the relationship between the number of MSVs and predictive accuracy. This validates the applicability of the proposed method in real-world scenarios.

3. **Practical Implications**: The method's independence from label information and its potential application for model selection using unlabeled data add significant practical value. The authors also propose the use of MSVs for applications in explainable AI (XAI), which is timely given the increasing scrutiny on AI deployments.

4. **Clear Organization**: The structure of the paper is coherent, effectively guiding the reader through the motivation, methodology, and empirical findings. The visual aids and figures complement the text well, making complex concepts easier to digest.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Theoretical Framework**: While the empirical results are robust, the theoretical grounding could be strengthened. A deeper exploration of the mathematical implications of MSVs, particularly in relation to generalization bounds, would enhance the paper’s rigor. Additionally, providing a clearer relationship between MSVs and existing theoretical frameworks could benefit future research.

2. **Algorithmic Complexity**: Although the authors present a greedy algorithm for estimating MSVs, discussions on algorithmic complexity, particularly in the context of high-dimensional data, could enhance understanding. More information on how scaling the algorithm might affect performance and computation time would be valuable for practitioners.

3. **Generalization Across Domains**: The focus on image classification tasks is a strength, but the paper could address the applicability of MSVs to various domains beyond computer vision, such as natural language processing or structured data. Including a broader perspective on potential applications could be beneficial.

4. **Comparative Analysis with Other Methods**: The paper mentions existing XAI methods but could value from a more systematic comparison regarding performance and interpretability. Detailing their relative advantages and shortcomings in the context of the proposed method would provide clearer insights for practitioners.

5. **Limitations of the Approach**: A discussion regarding the limitations or constraints of the MSVs framework, including potential pitfalls in certain contexts, would present a balanced view and ensure the community is aware of any biases or inadequacies in the proposed approach.

**Conclusion:**
The paper makes a significant contribution to understanding feature utilization in DNNs and presents a promising method for improving interpretability in AI models. By enhancing the theoretical foundation, addressing algorithmic complexity, and expanding the contextual scope, the authors could further solidify the impact of their work. Overall, this paper is likely to be a valuable addition to the ongoing discourse in deep learning and interpretability. I recommend it for acceptance pending minor revisions addressing the points mentioned above.
