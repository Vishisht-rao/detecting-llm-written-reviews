### Review of "MASSIVE EDITING FOR LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS"

#### Overview
The paper presents the MAssive Language Model Editing Network (MALMEN), a novel approach aimed at addressing the issues of scalability and memory efficiency in editing large language models (LLMs). The authors provide a comprehensive introduction and background on the current challenges faced by existing hyper-network approaches and position MALMEN as a solution that overcomes these limitations. The paper reports empirical results demonstrating the efficacy of MALMEN in editing thousands of facts across a variety of NLP tasks, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

#### Strengths
1. **Innovative Approach**: The formulation of parameter shift aggregation as a least squares problem represents a significant advancement in the methodology for editing LLMs. This innovative approach offers improved scalability and addresses statistical issues related to parameter shift cancellation.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The authors evaluate MALMEN on multiple architectures (BERT, GPT-2, T5-XL, and GPT-J), providing a broad understanding of its applicability across different models. The experiments indicate substantial scalability, allowing for the simultaneous editing of thousands of facts, which is a notable achievement.

3. **Clear and Detailed Methodology**: The paper provides a well-structured presentation of the method, including definitions, problem formulation, and the algorithmic details necessary to implement MALMEN. The distinction between computation on the hyper-network and the LLM is particularly insightful.

4. **Rigorous Ablation Studies**: The inclusion of ablation studies effectively highlights the contributions of various components of the MALMEN approach. This strengthens the authors' claims regarding the improvements over existing methodologies and ensures that the mechanisms of the approach are communicated clearly.

5. **Strong Empirical Results**: The results indicate that MALMEN significantly outperforms existing methods, such as MEND and MEMIT, in terms of the number of facts that can be edited while maintaining accuracy. This is presented with strong empirical evidence, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency.

#### Areas for Improvement
1. **Clarity of Theoretical Foundations**: While the mathematical formulations are mostly clear, some sections—especially those describing the derivation of the normal equation—could benefit from a more thorough elaboration. Providing more contextual explanation or visual aids could enhance understanding, especially for readers who may not have a strong mathematical background.

2. **Discussion of Limitations**: Although the authors briefly mention limitations, a more in-depth discussion could provide a clearer understanding of the potential boundaries of MALMEN's applicability. For instance, elaborating on the challenges of maintaining consistency across edits and the linear complexity concerning the number of edits could bring more depth to the critique of the proposed method.

3. **Specifics on Implementation Details**: Further elaboration on the practical implementation of MALMEN, including any computational constraints or difficulties encountered during empirical evaluations, would be beneficial. Sharing insights into how memory consumption was managed in practice could offer valuable learning points for practitioners in the field.

4. **Broader Context and Future Work**: A section discussing potential future work, such as possible ways to improve the generalization capabilities of MALMEN or integrate it with real-time learning and updating processes, could enhance the paper's contribution to the ongoing discourse in the field of model editing.

#### Conclusion
Overall, "MASSIVE EDITING FOR LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS" presents a significant advancement in the editing of LLMs through the introduction of MALMEN. The paper is well-structured and provides strong empirical results which validate the proposed methodology. With some additional clarifications and discussions on limitations and future work, this paper has the potential to make a substantial impact on the field of neural network editing. I recommend its acceptance for presentation at ICLR 2024, given its contributions to the community and the robust results that demonstrate the framework's capabilities.
