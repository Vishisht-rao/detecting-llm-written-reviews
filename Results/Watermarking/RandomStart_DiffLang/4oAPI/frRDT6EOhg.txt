### Review of "ARE HUMAN-GENERATED DEMONSTRATIONS NECESSARY FOR IN-CONTEXT LEARNING?"

#### Summary

This paper introduces a novel approach called Self-Contemplation Prompting (SEC) that seeks to address the limitations associated with human-generated demonstrations in the field of In-Context Learning (ICL) for large language models (LLMs). The authors propose that LLMs can autonomously generate their own demonstrations, thereby reducing dependency on human-crafted examples. Through extensive experimentation across various reasoning tasks, the paper demonstrates that SEC achieves comparable performance to traditional ICL methods while completely eliminating the need for human-crafted demonstrations.

#### Strengths

1. **Innovative Concept**: The concept of allowing models to generate their own demonstrations is a significant step towards reducing the reliance on human input in prompt engineering, which is often a bottleneck in many NLP tasks.

2. **Thorough Experiments**: The authors conducted extensive experiments across multiple datasets and tasks, including arithmetic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, multi-task language understanding, and code generation. This comprehensive evaluation allows for a robust assessment of the SEC framework.

3. **Strong Results**: The results present a compelling case for SEC's effectiveness. The paper reports that SEC not only outperforms zero-shot learning but also achieves comparable results to traditional ICL, suggesting that contemporary LLMs possess sufficient reasoning capabilities without external training data.

4. **Clear Framework**: The paper effectively lays out the framework of SEC, contrasting it with vanilla ICL and the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. This structured approach facilitates a clear understanding of the methodology.

5. **Discussion of Implications**: The authors discuss the broader implications of their work, suggesting that the need for manually annotated data may diminish in the future as LLMs continue to evolve. This sets the stage for future research possibly orienting towards entirely self-sufficient LLMs.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Limitations Not Fully Addressed**: While the paper mentions that SEC performs poorly with weaker models, it could delve deeper into scenarios where SEC fails, providing a more nuanced understanding of its limitations.

2. **Lack of Theoretical Foundations**: The paper primarily emphasizes empirical results but does less to explain why SEC works theoretically. A deeper exploration into the underlying cognitive and algorithmic principles that allow LLMs to generate valid demonstrations would enhance the study's rigor.

3. **Quality Control of Generated Demonstrations**: The automatic generation of demonstrations may introduce variance in quality. The paper would benefit from a more thorough analysis of the error patterns in generated output, assessing how often incorrect demonstrations lead to wrong conclusions compared to correct ones.

4. **Ablation Studies**: The paper could benefit more from ablation studies that disaggregate the various components of SEC to understand their individual contributions to performance, which would solidify its claims.

5. **Limited Scope of Tasks**: While a range of tasks is tested, including code generation and reasoning tasks, the paper could include more diverse and complex tasks that require multi-modal understanding (e.g., visual or spatial reasoning) to illustrate the versatility and limits of SEC.

#### Conclusion

Overall, the paper makes a promising contribution to the area of ICL by presenting SEC as an effective alternative to traditional methods reliant on human input. The approach could reshape how developers and researchers utilize LLMs across various applications. However, for future work, increased attention to theoretical insights, error analysis, and diversity of testing tasks will provide a more robust foundation and broader applicability of the SEC framework.
