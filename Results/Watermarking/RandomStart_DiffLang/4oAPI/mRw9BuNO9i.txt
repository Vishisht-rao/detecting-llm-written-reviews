OUTPUT:
The manuscript focuses on the question of cross-platform video compression, presenting a novel codebook-based approach to address the inconsistencies arising from floating point arithmetic on different hardware. The authors propose a minimalist framework that bypasses autoregressive entropy modeling and optical flow alignment, instead introducing a context model based on conditional cross-attention for better capturing temporal and spatial redundancies. The main contributions are timely and relevant given the increasing demand for efficient video codecs capable of functioning seamlessly across diverse platforms.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach**: The paper introduces a codebook-based method for video compression that avoids traditional entropy modeling challenges and thereby addresses the non-deterministic issues inherent in cross-platform scenarios. This conceptual shift is commendable and positions the proposed method as a potential solution for practical applications.

2. **Performance Metrics**: The experimental results are promising, demonstrating better rate-distortion performance compared to traditional codecs like H.265. The publication provides comprehensive results across multiple datasets, including the UVG, HEVC-Class B, and MCL-JCV, showing adaptability and robustness across different video types.

3. **Experimental Rigour**: The authors meticulously describe their experimental setup, data sources, and baseline comparisons, allowing for reproducibility. The ablation studies add further credence to the findings, clearly indicating the advantages of the proposed window-based cross-attention mechanism over traditional methods.

4. **Cross-Platform Capability**: The focus on cross-platform applicability is a significant strength. The authors provide a thorough analysis of performance across different decoding platforms, affirming the robustness of their framework under varying computational circumstances.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limitations Discussed**: While the authors acknowledge the limitations of their method, particularly regarding the lack of constraints on entropy leading to fixed bitstreams for various video contents, the manuscript could benefit from a more in-depth discussion on how these limitations may impact certain real-world applications, especially given the increasing complexity of diverse video content.

2. **Quantitative Results**: Although the results show promising rate-distortion performance, it would be helpful for the authors to explain in greater detail the practical implications of these improvements in a real-world context. For instance, comparisons with state-of-the-art neural codecs other than H.265 would provide a clearer picture of the current standing and relevance of their work.

3. **Visualizations**: The paper contains a variety of figures, but some could be clearer. For example, providing clearer legends and labels in the rate-distortion curves would help readers follow the implications of the data presented without ambiguity.

4. **Limited Exploration of Other Metrics**: While the authors focus on PSNR and MS-SSIM, they could consider utilizing and discussing other relevant perceptual metrics (such as LPIPS) throughout their analysis, which may offer deeper insights into visual fidelity beyond traditional metrics.

**Overall Assessment:**

The manuscript presents a novel and well-executed approach to video compression that holds promise for addressing the challenges presented by cross-platform deployment. With its innovative use of codebooks and contextual modeling, it notably contributes to the field of neural video codecs. Although there are areas for improvement, particularly regarding the discussion of limitations and clarity of presentation, the results are promising and warrant consideration for publication. The authors should also consider expanding their comparisons to include other state-of-the-art methods to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. I encourage the authors to address these points to strengthen the paper further.
