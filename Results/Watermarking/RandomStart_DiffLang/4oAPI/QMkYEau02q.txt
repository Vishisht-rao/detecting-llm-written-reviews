OUTPUT:
**Review of "PHYSICS-GUIDED LEARNING OF METEOROLOGICAL DYNAMICS FOR WEATHER FORECASTING AND DOWN-SCALING"**

**Overall Impression:**
The manuscript presents an innovative approach to weather forecasting and downscaling by integrating deep learning techniques with physics-based numerical weather prediction (NWP). This hybrid model, termed PhyDL-NWP, aims to overcome limitations associated with both traditional NWP methods and purely data-driven deep learning approaches. The authors provide a thorough background on the challenges in weather forecasting, present their methodology, and substantiate their claims with extensive experimental results across multiple real-world datasets. 

**Strengths:**
1. **Significant Contribution**: The proposed PhyDL-NWP framework combines physical principles with deep learning, offering a valuable alternative to conventional NWP models and purely empirical deep learning methods.
  
2. **Rigorous Testing**: The authors conduct extensive experiments on three diverse real-world datasets, providing comparative analysis against 13 baseline models. The reported improvements in performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, Anomaly Correlation Coefficient) are compelling and substantiate the efficacy of the proposed framework.

3. **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is well-organized and clearly structured, guiding the reader through the introduction of the problem to the details of methodology, results, and conclusions. The presentation is supported by well-chosen figures and tables that clarify complex information.

4. **Physical Insights**: The manuscript not only seeks to improve prediction accuracy but also aims to enhance understanding of meteorological dynamics by incorporating discovered partial differential equations (PDEs) into the modeling process. This promotes both interpretability and the potential for further scientific advancements in the field.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Literature Review**: While the authors touch on relevant literature, a more comprehensive review could benefit the current understanding of existing methods and how PhyDL-NWP innovatively builds upon them. Specifically, discussing the limitations of each highlighted method more deeply might elucidate why a hybrid approach is necessary.

2. **Algorithmic Details**: While the methodology is broadly outlined, certain algorithmic details, such as the training procedures, hyperparameter tuning, and the selection process for incorporating physical knowledge into the model, could be elaborated on. This would enhance reproducibility and provide deeper insights into how practitioners might implement PhyDL-NWP in their work.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: While the authors report performance gains of PhyDL-NWP over the baselines, it would be beneficial to provide additional statistical analysis—for instance, p-values or effect sizes—for the reported performance improvements to support the claims made with more substantial evidence.

4. **Failure Cases**: The paper glosses over potential shortcomings or limitations of the proposed approach in specific scenarios or datasets. Including a discussion of cases where PhyDL-NWP does not perform as expected would provide a more balanced perspective.

**Minor Comments:**
- The notation used in some equations, particularly in the methodology section, could benefit from additional clarification or a brief explanation for readability.
- Ensuring consistent formatting and citation styles throughout would improve the overall presentation of the manuscript.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, this is a strong manuscript that presents a promising hybrid methodology for weather forecasting and downscaling by integrating physics with deep learning. Addressing the suggested points for improvement could enhance clarity, reproducibility, and the overall impact of the work. The combination of improved predictive performance, physical insights, and the introduction of PhyDL-NWP establishes a clear pathway forward for advancements in meteorological modeling. I recommend acceptance for presentation at ICLR 2024, contingent upon addressing the feedback provided.
