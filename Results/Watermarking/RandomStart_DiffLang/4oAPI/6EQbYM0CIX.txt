**Review of "Conditional Generative Modeling for High-Dimensional Marked Temporal Point Processes"**

**Overview**  
This paper presents a novel framework for modeling marked temporal point processes (MTPPs) utilizing conditional generative modeling techniques. The authors address the limitations of existing point process models, particularly their struggles with high-dimensional marks (e.g., textual or visual data), by proposing a generative approach that avoids direct reliance on conditional intensity or probability density functions.

**Strengths**  
1. **Innovative Approach**: The paper introduces a significant departure from traditional point process models by employing a conditional event generator that constructs events based on historical context. This generative modeling perspective is well-aligned with recent advancements in machine learning, which emphasize sample generation over explicit density estimation.

2. **Handling High-Dimensional Marks**: The emphasis on high-dimensional marks showcases a timely and relevant extension to point process modeling. The authors identify key challenges in traditional methods and convincingly argue for the advantages of their model in application areas where data complexity is increasing.

3. **Empirical Results**: The authors provide extensive experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance against several state-of-the-art methods. The detailed quantitative and qualitative results underscore the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed model.

4. **Computational Efficiency**: The algorithm's scalability is another crucial strength. By achieving a complexity of \(O(NT)\) for generating \(NT\) events, the proposed method offers considerable advantages over traditional thinning algorithms, which can be prohibitively costly in high-dimensional settings.

5. **Model-Agnostic Framework**: The proposed framework's flexibility allows it to accommodate different types of generative models, increasing its potential applicability across various domains.

**Weaknesses**  
1. **Lack of Theoretical Insights**: While the paper successfully demonstrates empirical performance, it would benefit from deeper theoretical insights. Specifically, providing bounds on the approximation errors or conditions under which the model excels would strengthen the paper’s contribution to the field.

2. **Implementation Details**: The paper could improve clarity regarding the implementation of the model, including the training procedures and the choice of kernel functions. More detailed pseudo-code or a flowchart of the training process could enhance replicability.

3. **Parameter Sensitivity**: The paper touches on the role of kernels in density estimation but doesn’t adequately explore the implications of parameter sensitivity. An investigation into the robustness of the learned representations and how they vary with different hyperparameters would provide important insights.

4. **Comparative Metrics**: The paper primarily focuses on log-likelihood and mean relative error as evaluation metrics. Including additional metrics to assess the quality of generated sequences, such as visual coherence or semantic similarity in the context of high-dimensional marks, could enrich the evaluation.

**Conclusion**  
Overall, "Conditional Generative Modeling for High-Dimensional Marked Temporal Point Processes" offers a valuable contribution to the field of event modeling. The innovative use of conditional generative techniques to address challenges in high-dimensional marked data is both relevant and timely. Future work could benefit from more rigorous theoretical analysis and breadth in comparative metrics, but the empirical results presented are promising and suggest that the framework could have significant implications for various applications. 

I recommend the paper for acceptance, with the hope that the authors will address the identified weaknesses in a revised version.
