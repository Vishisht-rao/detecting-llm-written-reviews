### Review of "LIGHTWEIGHT, PRE-TRAINED TRANSFORMERS FOR REMOTE SENSING TIMESERIES"

#### Summary
The paper presents the Pretrained Remote Sensing Transformer (Presto), a novel, lightweight transformer model specifically designed for processing remote sensing pixel-time series data through self-supervised learning techniques. The authors argue that traditional methods primarily based on natural images fail to leverage the unique aspects of remote sensing data, such as its multi-modal character, temporal dynamics, and associated metadata. Presto aims to address these limitations by offering a model that effectively captures the intricacies of remote sensing while maintaining computational efficiency. The results show that Presto performs competitively with larger models across various tasks, requiring significantly fewer computational resources.

#### Strengths
1. **Addressing a Critical Need**: The paper addresses an important challenge in remote sensing applications – the difficulty and cost of obtaining labeled data for training machine learning models. The use of self-supervised learning is a timely and relevant approach to mitigate this issue.

2. **Innovative Model Design**: Presto is explicitly designed for remote sensing data, taking into account the spatial and temporal dimensions specific to this domain. The introduction of structured masking strategies tailored to the data further enhances the model's ability to learn from incomplete inputs, which is crucial for real-world applications.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The authors provide a thorough evaluation of Presto across multiple datasets, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability to diverse tasks and data modalities. The reported results clearly highlight its competitive performance relative to more complex models.

4. **Computational Efficiency**: The emphasis on creating a lightweight model capable of achieving state-of-the-art results with significantly fewer parameters is commendable. This aspect enhances the accessibility of advanced remote sensing methodologies for practitioners with limited computational resources.

5. **Ethical Considerations**: The inclusion of an ethics statement reflects awareness of the potential implications of deploying machine learning in remote sensing applications, particularly concerning privacy and consent issues.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Lack of Comparisons with More Recent Techniques**: While the authors benchmark Presto against existing state-of-the-art models, further comparisons with the latest advancements in remote sensing and self-supervised learning would offer a more comprehensive understanding of Presto’s standing in the current landscape.

2. **Aggregation Methodology**: The paper reveals that Presto's performance can plateau with high-resolution images due to its independent pixel processing approach. This is a significant limitation for applications requiring spatial awareness. Exploring alternative aggregation techniques during inference could help mitigate this issue.

3. **Limited Detail on Pre-training Dataset**: The paper provides some information regarding the pre-training dataset’s construction. However, a more extensive discussion on its representativeness and potential biases, particularly in the context of global applications, would strengthen the argument for Presto's broad applicability.

4. **Lack of Insight into Failure Modes**: While the authors discuss limitations, there could be a more detailed exploration of the scenarios where Presto fails to perform well (e.g., specific classes in EuroSat). Understanding these failure modes could provide insights into designing future models.

#### Suggestions for Improvement
- Include a broader range of comparative analyses with newer models, particularly those emerging in the last year.
- Consider integrating strategies for effectively aggregating spatial information during the prediction phase, especially when dealing with high-resolution satellite imagery.
- Expand the discussion on the pre-training dataset's inherent biases and representativeness to provide a clear picture of the model's applicability across diverse contexts.
- Incorporate a more in-depth analysis of identified failure modes and strategies for improvement.

#### Conclusion
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the intersection of machine learning and remote sensing by presenting Presto, a model that addresses critical challenges in the field. It successfully highlights the importance of tailored approaches and the utility of unsupervised learning in tackling data scarcity. With revisions addressing the mentioned weaknesses, this work could serve as a foundational reference for future investigations into advanced remote sensing methodologies.
