### Review of the Paper “Unifying Model-Based and Model-Free Reinforcement Learning with Equivalent Policy Sets”

#### Summary
The authors present a novel approach to reinforcement learning (RL) that seeks to unify model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) and model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL) using a new concept called Equivalent Policy Sets (EPS). The paper proposes a new algorithm, Unified RL, which leverages models to constrain model-free policies to a set of policies that are not provably suboptimal. The paper claims that this method combines the strengths of both approaches, improves data efficiency, and maintains robustness in various scenarios where traditional methods struggle.

#### Strengths
1. **Novel Contribution**: The introduction of EPS as a tool to quantify the limitations of models in decision-making is innovative and addresses critical challenges in the field of RL. This work diverges from traditional methods that often assume models can perfectly estimate optimal behaviors.

2. **Empirical Validation**: The paper presents thorough empirical results across a range of benchmarks, demonstrating that Unified RL effectively combines the strengths of MBRL and MFRL. The use of standard environments like OpenAI Gym and the DeepMind Control Suite adds credibility to the experimental results.

3. **Robustness to Model Misalignments**: The experiments show that Unified RL can perform well even in environments where typical MBRL or MFRL would fail due to model misalignments or poor configurations. This is a significant advantage and highlights the adaptability of the proposed approach.

4. **Clear Methodology**: The delineation of the Unified RL algorithm, including both MBRL and MFRL components, is well-structured and detailed. This clarity allows readers to understand the implementation and potential modifications to the framework.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Limited Exploration Strategy**: The paper acknowledges a limitation regarding exploration, suggesting that the algorithm does not actively pursue intelligent exploration strategies. This could affect the performance in environments that necessitate extensive exploration.

2. **Complexity and Implementation**: While the methodology is detailed, the implementation of EPS and the requirement for both model-based and model-free components could lead to an increased complexity that might be challenging for practitioners to implement effectively.

3. **Dependency on Hyperparameters**: The performance of Unified RL appears sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters for both the model-based and model-free components, as evidenced in the hyperparameter table. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses would strengthen the claims of robustness.

4. **Future Directions**: Although the authors mention future work, such as exploring the integration of EPS directly into model-free updates, more details could have been provided regarding potential strategies for this integration.

#### Overall Impression
This paper presents a compelling advance in the field of reinforcement learning by effectively integrating model-based and model-free approaches through a novel methodology. The rigorous empirical evaluation supporting the proposed framework enhances its credibility. However, practical implementations may be challenged by complexity and hyperparameter sensitivity. The authors have laid a strong foundation for future research in this area, and with further refinements, their approach could significantly enhance the robustness and performance of reinforcement learning algorithms. 

**Recommendation**: Accept with minor revisions. The paper’s contributions and experimental validation position it well within the current literature, and addressing the highlighted weaknesses will enhance its impact.
