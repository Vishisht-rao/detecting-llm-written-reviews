### Review of "Recurrent Linear Transformers"

#### Summary
The paper introduces two innovative architectures, the Recurrent Linear Transformer (ReLiT) and the Approximate Recurrent Linear Transformer (AReLiT), designed to address the limitations of conventional transformer architectures in sequential data processing, specifically in the context of reinforcement learning (RL). The authors argue that the notable computational expenses associated with standard transformers hinder their practical applicability in RL tasks. By leveraging recurrent mechanisms and proposing a modified self-attention mechanism, the paper claims to enable more efficient contexts with lower computational costs while still capturing long-range dependencies.

#### Strengths
1. **Timely and Relevant Problem**: The paper tackles a significant limitation in the application of transformer architectures to RL, where both memory efficiency and computational speed are paramount. This is particularly relevant given the increasing complexity of RL environments.
   
2. **Innovative Approaches**: The introduction of ReLiT and AReLiT is a novel approach in the space of transformers, extending the Linear Transformer architecture through gating mechanisms and approximation techniques. This innovation could stimulate further exploration in the field.

3. **Thorough Empirical Evaluation**: The paper provides comprehensive empirical results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architectures across several partially observable RL environments, including T-Maze, CartPole, Mystery Path, and Memory Maze. These results present a compelling case for the architectures' practical advantages.

4. **Clear Contribution**: The paper clearly delineates the theoretical and practical improvements over existing architectures, quantifying considerable reductions in computational overhead and memory usage when compared to GTrXL, a state-of-the-art RL transformer.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Limited Theoretical Justification**: While the empirical contributions are significant, the theoretical grounding for why the architectural choices enhance performance is somewhat limited. For instance, the authors could further elaborate on how the gating mechanism specifically enables better memory retention compared to scalar gating.

2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: The paper outlines that certain architectures achieve better performance based on tuning specific hyperparameters (e.g., Î· and r for AReLiT). A more in-depth discussion on how these settings impact performance stability across various environments would be beneficial.

3. **Comparison with Other Approaches**: The paper underplays the comparative landscape of various alternative architectures designed for similar problems. A more thorough benchmarking against other recent works (like RWKV or S4) could provide a more comprehensive understanding of where ReLiT and AReLiT stand in the current literature.

4. **Complexity of the Approximations**: The approximations introduced (specifically in AReLiT) are intriguing, but it would be advantageous to clarify how different values of r affect performance and whether the complexity introduced in approximating the Kronecker delta will have implications in other contexts or domains.

#### Conclusion
Overall, the paper presents a compelling advancement in transformer architecture for reinforcement learning, providing practical solutions to some of the pressing issues related to computational inefficiencies. The evaluation is robust, showcasing improvements over existing methods. However, there is room for enhancing theoretical foundations, addressing hyperparameter dependencies, and situating the contributions more thoroughly within the broader landscape of related work. As a contribution to the ICLR community, the paper holds promise for further research and practical applications in the field of efficient sequence modeling and RL.
