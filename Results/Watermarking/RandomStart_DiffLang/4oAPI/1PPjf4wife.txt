**Review of "Leveraging Large Language Models for Optimised Coordination in Textual Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning"**

**1. Summary**
The authors propose a novel framework titled Functionally-Aligned Multi-Agents (FAMA) that leverages large language models (LLMs) to improve coordination among agents in the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) setting. The core premise is that existing MARL algorithms struggle with sample efficiency and interpretability when fostering cooperative behaviors across various tasks, and the proposed FAMA framework addresses these issues by utilizing LLMs for both functional alignment and natural language-based communication among agents.

The framework employs two main components: a centralized Actor that represents all agent policies and a central Critic for value evaluation, enriching the agents' decision-making capabilities while promoting coordinated behavior. The authors evaluate FAMA across two textual multi-agent environments, BabyAI-Text and a traffic junction environment, against traditional methods like independent LLM approaches and symbolic reinforcement learning baselines. 

**2. Novelty and Contributions**
The paper makes several important contributions:
- The introduction of the FAMA framework, specifically designed to align LLMs with the functional requirements of cooperative tasks within MARL settings.
- An exploration of natural language communication as a tool for enhancing inter-agent coordination, which is relatively under-researched in existing literature.
- Experimental evidence demonstrating the advantages of FAMA over traditional approaches, particularly in terms of performance metrics like reward efficiency and error reduction.
- Insights into the interpretability of communication protocols that emerge from the use of natural language in coordination tasks.

**3. Technical Soundness**
The methodology presented appears technically sound, with a robust formulation of both the Actor and Critic components in the FAMA framework. The experiments are designed to answer two critical questions about coordination-centric solutions and the benefits of natural language communication. The authors provide sufficient experimental detail, making it possible to reproduce their results.

However, the introduction of text-based environments may introduce inherent limitations, such as the challenge of ensuring that LLMs effectively understand the task at hand while relying on text inputs. This needs to be accounted for in both the framework design and its empirical evaluation.

**4. Experimental Validation**
The experimental validation provided is comprehensive, covering critical aspects of cooperative tasks in MARL. The results show clear advantages of FAMA in achieving higher success rates and lower error rates in coordinating tasks versus the baselines. However, further analysis of these results would strengthen the paper. For instance, providing more information about the statistical significance of the results, including variance across runs, could help reinforce the robustness of the claims made.

Additionally, the authors should clarify whether the results can be generalized to other types of environments or whether they are specific to the presented cases.

**5. Interpretation of Results**
The authors do well in interpreting the results, especially regarding how they relate to the theoretical benefits of functional alignment and natural language communication. However, a deeper dive into the practical implications of these findings for real-world applications would provide additional context and relevance.

**6. Related Work Discussion**
While the authors reference relevant literature, a more thorough review of previous works that have explored language-conditioned MARL or the use of LLMs in complex environments would enrich the discussion. Drawing clearer connections to existing methods and highlighting what differentiates FAMA could better situate this work within the landscape of multi-agent systems research.

**7. Clarity and Presentation**
The paper is well-structured and generally well-written, although some portions could benefit from clearer exposition. For example, certain technical details regarding the architecture of the LLM or the training process might be made more accessible to a wider audience. 

Figures and diagrams effectively illustrate the framework and results, enhancing reader understanding and engagement.

**8. Future Directions**
The paper suggests promising future directions, particularly in improving inference times for largescale models and exploring non-discrete communication methods. Expanding on how these challenges could be approached in subsequent work would add value to the conclusion.

**9. Conclusion**
Overall, the paper presents a significant advancement in the use of LLMs for improving coordination in MARL settings. The proposed FAMA framework demonstrates promising results, and the discussion provides a solid foundation for further exploration. Addressing the outlined points could greatly enhance the clarity of the paper and its contributions to the field.

**Recommendation:** This paper is recommended for acceptance, pending minor revisions addressing the outlined issues, particularly around statistical analysis, clarity of exposition, and a more comprehensive related work discussion.
