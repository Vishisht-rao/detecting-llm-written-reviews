**Review of "Causal Structure Learning Supervised by Large Language Model"**

**Overview:**
The paper presents a novel framework, Iterative LLM Supervised Causal Structure Learning (ILS-CSL), that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into the process of Causal Structure Learning (CSL) to improve causal inference from observational data. By addressing the limitations of existing approaches, particularly issues related to erroneous inferences and ancestral constraints, the authors claim that their proposed method demonstrates superior performance across several real-world datasets.

**Contributions:**
1. **Innovative Approach:** The integration of LLMs into CSL is both innovative and timely, taking advantage of the recent advancements in LLM technology to provide insights and constraints that can enhance the quality of causal discovery.
   
2. **Iterative Mechanism:** The iterative refinement of causal structures based on LLM feedback is a notable strength. This approach allows the method to adapt and correct previous iterations, potentially leading to more accurate identification of causal relationships.

3. **Thorough Evaluation:** The authors evaluate ILS-CSL on eight real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing erroneous constraints compared to prior methods. The use of scaled Structural Hamming Distance (SHD) as a performance metric provides a standardized measure for comparison.

4. **Analysis of Errors:** The paper presents a detailed analysis of the types of errors that LLMs are prone to and how these are mitigated in the proposed framework. The statistical estimation of prior errors is a commendable effort that adds depth to the evaluation of the method.

**Strengths:**
- The framework is well-structured, outlining the limitations of existing methods and positioning ILS-CSL as a significant improvement.
- The experimental results are convincing, with clear trends demonstrating enhanced performance over baseline methods.
- The manuscript effectively communicates complex ideas, making it accessible to a diverse audience, including those less familiar with causal inference.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Clarification of Concepts:** Some technical terms and concepts, such as “ancestral constraints” and the precise role of LLMs in defining causal edges, may benefit from additional clarification. A more detailed explanation of how LLMs transform qualitative statements into quantitative constraints might enhance understanding.

2. **Scalability Analysis:** The computational efficiency of ILS-CSL, particularly in terms of the time complexity and scalability when applied to larger datasets, could be discussed in greater detail. How does the iterative process affect computational demands, especially for datasets with significantly larger variable counts?

3. **Generalizability:** While the results across eight datasets are promising, it would strengthen the paper to include a discussion on the generalizability of the ILS-CSL framework to other domains or types of data. How might the method perform in settings with different characteristics or noise levels?

4. **Qualitative Insights:** Beyond the quantitative results, incorporating qualitative insights or case studies from the datasets used could enhance the narrative. Specific examples of how ILS-CSL identifies relationships differently from traditional methods would provide practical implications.

**Conclusion:**
This paper contributes significantly to the field of causal discovery by presenting a robust framework that leverages the capabilities of LLMs. ILS-CSL’s iterative approach and its demonstrated performance improvements mark a promising advancement in CSL methodologies. Addressing the areas for improvement would further strengthen the paper and provide clearer insights for practitioners aiming to apply these techniques in real-world scenarios.
