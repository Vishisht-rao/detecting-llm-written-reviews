### Review of "Active Teacher Selection for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback"

#### Summary
The authors present a novel approach to offline Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) through the introduction of the Hidden Utility Bandit (HUB) framework. By acknowledging that existing models often assume a single teacher providing feedback, this work innovatively incorporates the complexities of multiple human teachers with varying levels of expertise and cost. The Active Teacher Selection (ATS) algorithm proposed is shown to outperform baseline methods in two real-world applications: paper recommendation systems and COVID-19 vaccine testing.

#### Contribution to the Field
The paper addresses a significant gap in the RLHF literature by formalizing the teacher selection process as a Hidden Utility Bandit problem. This formalization allows for a more nuanced approach to reward learning by recognizing that human feedback is not uniform and can vary significantly across different teachers. The use of a structured mathematical model enhances the theoretical foundation of the approach, making it a valuable contribution to the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

#### Methodology
The methodology is well-structured, beginning with background on related bandit problems and POMDPs, followed by a clear definition of the HUB framework. The development of the ATS algorithm, characterized by its capacity to maintain beliefs about teacher preferences and select queries based on utility, is robust and innovative. The authors also introduce multiple baselines and conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate their methods rigorously. 

The experimental design is particularly commendable, as it tests the framework across two varied domains, providing evidence of generalizability. Figures and results reported are well-analyzed and illustrate clearly how ATS consistently outperforms naive and random algorithms.

#### Results and Discussion
The results convincingly demonstrate that ATS not only maximizes cumulative rewards more efficiently but also enhances the accuracy of utility learning over time. The discussion on the implications of the findings is insightful, particularly how correctly identifying the best teacher leads to improved model performance and safety in deployment scenarios. 

The paper also explores the interplay between teacher noise, costs, and performance, providing a nuanced understanding of the dynamics involved in RLHF systems. The conclusion that actively selecting when and which teachers to query significantly enhances learning outcomes is a key takeaway that has broad implications in the field.

#### Strengths
1. **Novelty**: The introduction of the HUB framework and ATS algorithm brings fresh insights into RLHF, addressing known limitations in current methods.
2. **Theoretical Rigor**: The formalization of the problem and the backing of claims by theoretical results strengthen the paper's credibility.
3. **Empirical Validation**: Comprehensive experiments across relevant real-world domains bolster the practical relevance of the proposed methods.
4. **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is generally well-organized and accessible, with clear explanations and logical flow that guide the reader through complex concepts.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Assumptions on Teacher Rationality**: While modeling teacher rationality is an innovative step, the framework may still simplify the complexities of real-world human feedback. More discussions on the limitations of assuming a single shared utility for teachers would enhance the understanding of potential pitfalls.
2. **Scalability Concerns**: The experimental settings, although comprehensive, raise questions about how well ATS would scale with a significantly larger number of teachers or complex environments. Future work should address scalability comprehensively.
3. **Real-World Deployment**: The paper provides a strong theoretical foundation and empirical evidence, but more concrete guidelines on deploying these methods in practical, real-world settings would be beneficial.

#### Conclusion
Overall, the paper presents a significant advancement in the field of reinforcement learning by innovatively addressing the challenge of learning from multiple teachers in human feedback scenarios. The well-articulated concepts, robust methodologies, and compelling empirical results make it a valuable contribution to both theoretical and practical aspects of reinforcement learning. The suggestions for future work to explore the scalability and deployment of the proposed methods will further enrich the discourse on this evolving topic. 

I recommend acceptance of this paper for presentation at ICLR 2024.
