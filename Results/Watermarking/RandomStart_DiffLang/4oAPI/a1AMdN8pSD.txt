**Review of "Neural Implicit Mapping via Nested Neighborhoods: Real-Time Rendering of Textured Neural SDFs"**  

**Summary and Contribution**  
The authors present a novel framework for real-time rendering of neural signed distance functions (SDFs) that addresses the joint estimation of surface geometry and its attributes, such as normals and textures. The major contributions include the introduction of the "nesting condition" for neighborhoods of zero-level sets, enabling improved sphere tracing (ST) performance without the need for spatial data structures, as well as novel algorithms for normal computation and attribute mapping. This approach is particularly significant in the context of dynamic surfaces, where traditional methods tend to struggle with real-time constraints.

The paper is well-structured and clearly outlines the limitations of existing methods, such as marching cubes and previous neural SDF techniques that lack support for attributes or dynamic surfaces. The proposed framework is validated through a comprehensive set of experiments, including ablation studies that demonstrate its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods.

**Strengths**  
1. **Novel Contributions**: The introduction of nested neighborhoods and the associated algorithms for multiscale ST and neural attribute mapping are innovative concepts that significantly push the boundaries of current capabilities in neural rendering.
   
2. **Performance Metrics**: The authors provide thorough experiments that compare their methods against leading approaches, demonstrating both qualitative and quantitative improvements in rendering speed, quality (MSE), and scalability (particularly in handling dynamic scenes).

3. **Clear Presentation**: The paper is generally well-organized, with a logical flow between the introduction, theoretical framework, method descriptions, and experiments. The use of figures to illustrate key concepts helps to clarify complex ideas.

4. **Real-Time Applications**: The potential applications of the proposed techniques in real-time rendering and 3D content generation workflows (highlighted in the conclusion) are promising and relevant to both academia and industry.

**Weaknesses**  
1. **Complexity Management**: While the authors claim improvements in the performance of their framework, it might be beneficial to provide a deeper analysis of the computational costs associated with their method, particularly in relation to the overhead introduced by the multilayer perceptron structures used in the GEMM-based normal computations.

2. **Limited Comparisons**: The paper primarily compares against a few state-of-the-art methods. Broader comparisons with other recent advances in neural rendering, particularly those leveraging deep learning techniques and low-parametric representations, could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed framework’s performance.

3. **Dynamic Surface Handling**: Although the ability to render dynamic SDFs is a significant claim, further elaboration on how the approach might scale with varying complexity, or different types of dynamic surfaces, would strengthen the discussion. In particular, an analysis of limitations and potential failure modes under extreme conditions would be valuable.

4. **Parameter Sensitivity**: The paper mentions choices around the δ parameters for the nesting condition, but it lacks in-depth sensitivity analysis. A more detailed discussion on how varying these parameters affects outcomes and performance would enhance the understanding of the system's robustness.

**Conclusion**  
Overall, this paper presents a meaningful advancement in the field of neural rendering, particularly for dynamic surfaces. The introduction of nested neighborhoods as a framework for enhancing sphere tracing performance is particularly innovative. The thorough experimental validations bolster the claims made in the paper. However, supplementary analyses concerning computational complexity, broader comparative studies, and insights into parameter sensitivity could enhance the contribution and its impact. I believe that this work will be a valuable addition to the conference and recommend it for acceptance with minor revisions.
