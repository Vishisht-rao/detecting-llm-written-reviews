**Review of "IF THERE IS NO UNDERFITTING, THERE IS NO COLD POSTERIOR EFFECT"**

This paper addresses a significant topic within the field of Bayesian deep learning: the cold posterior effect (CPE), which posits that artificially tempering the posterior (i.e., using a temperature T < 1) can lead to better predictive performance compared to the untempered Bayesian posterior (T = 1). The authors propose a novel perspective on this effect by suggesting that the presence of CPE signifies underfitting of the Bayesian posterior, arguing that if there is no underfitting, there cannot be a CPE.

**Strengths:**
1. **Theoretical Contribution**: The paper provides a clear theoretical framework linking CPE to underfitting, which is a crucial advancement in understanding this phenomenon. The authors adequately describe how CPE can be interpreted through the lens of model underfitting induced by prior and likelihood misspecifications.

2. **Nuanced Discussion of Misspecification**: By integrating the concepts of prior and likelihood misspecification with underfitting, the authors present a more holistic picture of the factors contributing to CPE. This insight is significant for both theoretical understanding and practical applications, as it impacts how Bayesian models might be improved.

3. **Empirical Validation**: The inclusion of empirical studies supports their theoretical assertions. The experimental results demonstrate the relationship between model flexibility, prior choices, likelihood specifications, and the resulting CPE, enhancing the robustness of their claims.

4. **Applications to Data Augmentation**: The exploration of data augmentation (DA) as a cause of CPE offers valuable insights, especially given the contemporary relevance of DA in machine learning. The paper ties the results back to practical implications for model design, presenting actionable recommendations for practitioners.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity and Clarity**: The paper is quite dense, which may deter readers who are not well-versed in Bayesian theory or deep learning. While the authors strive to present a thorough exploration of the topic, some sections could benefit from more concise language or summarization of key points to facilitate understanding.

2. **Scope of Empirical Results**: Although the empirical results are insightful, the experiments appear mostly based on synthetic or limited datasets (e.g., MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10). It would enhance the paper's impact to see the claims tested on a broader array of real-world problems and more complex datasets.

3. **Over-reliance on Specific Models**: While the focus on Bayesian neural networks is justified, a discussion on how these results might generalize to other types of probabilistic models could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the implications of the findings.

4. **Terminology Clarity**: The paper introduces several new concepts and terminologies (e.g., warm posterior effect), but some of these terms are used without definition or context, which could confuse readers.

**Recommendations:**
- Consider restructuring some sections to enhance clarity and readability, particularly the theoretical arguments and their implications.
- Expand the experimental setup to include more diverse datasets and real-world applications to validate the theoretical contributions more robustly.
- Provide definitions or context for any novel terminology to ensure readers can follow the discussion without prior extensive knowledge of the concepts presented.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the understanding of the cold posterior effect in Bayesian deep learning. Its theoretical insights and empirical support demonstrate a compelling connection between underfitting and CPE, which could inform future research and practical implementations in the field. With some refinements in clarity and scope, the work can significantly influence Bayesian modeling approaches in deep learning contexts.
