**Review of "LLMATIC: Neural Architecture Search via Large Language Models and Quality Diversity Optimization"**

**Summary:**
The paper presents LLMatic, a novel Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm that combines the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation with Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization techniques. It addresses the challenge of efficiently searching for diverse and high-performing neural network architectures while requiring a limited number of candidate evaluations (2000). The authors empirically validate LLMatic on benchmark datasets CIFAR-10 and NAS-bench-201, demonstrating its performance is comparable to state-of-the-art methods, notably with a limited computational budget.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach**: The integration of LLMs for architecture generation and QD for maintaining diversity offers an original perspective on NAS. This combination is timely given the growing complexity of designing neural networks and the limitations of traditional search methods.
  
2. **Efficiency**: Achieving competitive performance with only 2000 evaluations is a significant contribution, suggesting that LLMatic can operate effectively without extensive computational resources or prior expert knowledge on benchmark domains.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The empirical validation using common benchmarks (CIFAR-10 and NAS-bench-201) and the extensive ablation studies strengthen the claim regarding the necessity of each component within LLMatic and provide insights into the performance of various configurations. 

4. **Clear Presentation**: The paper is well-organized, with clear sections outlining the methodology, experiments, and analysis. The use of figures and tables effectively illustrates key findings.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Comparison with Diverse Techniques**: While the paper compares LLMatic against certain popular NAS methods, a broader evaluation against a wider range of NAS algorithms and settings could provide deeper insights into its relative strengths and weaknesses.

2. **Generality of Prompts**: The approach relies heavily on the effectiveness of prompts for LLMs in generating neural network architectures. It would be beneficial to discuss how these prompts were designed and their generalizability across different types of problems or datasets.

3. **Dependence on Model Size**: The chosen architecture utilizes a specific size of the CodeGen model (6.1B parameters). A discussion regarding the scalability of LLMatic when using larger models or its applicability when utilizing smaller models would add to the overall applicability of the findings.

4. **Performance Metrics**: The paper focuses primarily on test accuracy as the performance metric. Including other metrics such as inference time, memory consumption, or robustness against overfitting could provide a more comprehensive view of the models generated by LLMatic.

5. **Potential Overfitting Concerns**: While achieving high performance on CIFAR-10 is commendable, it may not necessarily transfer well to other datasets. Future work could include cross-domain evaluations to assess the robustness of the generated architectures.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the authors present a compelling and innovative approach to NAS by leveraging LLMs alongside QD optimization strategies. LLMatic's efficiency merits attention in the field, especially among researchers seeking to reduce computational costs in neural architecture design. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above in future work would further substantiate the contributions of LLMatic and enhance its applicability across broader contexts in machine learning research. I recommend the paper for acceptance, given its significance and potential impact on the NAS community.
