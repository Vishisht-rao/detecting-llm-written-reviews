### Review of "MULTI REACT: Multimodal Tools Augmented Reasoning-Acting Traces for Embodied Agent Planning"

#### Summary

The paper presents MultiReAct, a novel framework aimed at enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long-horizon embodied tasks through the integration of multimodal tools. The authors identify significant limitations of traditional LLMs when dealing with complex instructions that include intricate visual concepts. By introducing a combination of parameter-efficient visual language models, a CLIP-based reward model, and a distinctive framework for planning through multimodal tools, the authors aim to address the challenges inherent in multimodal reasoning and ensure successful execution of long-term goals.

#### Strengths

1. **Novel Contribution**: The introduction of the MultiReAct framework is a commendable effort towards enhancing LLMs for embodied AI tasks. The framework's innovative integration of visual demonstrations, multimodal reasoning, and a reward model demonstrates significant advancements compared to existing methodologies.

2. **Comprehensive Approach**: The framework supports two distinct actors (imitation learning and code generation), which allows for a flexible and adaptive system capable of tackling a wide variety of tasks. This versatility is an important asset in applications of embodied AI.

3. **Experimental Validation**: The authors present extensive experimental results demonstrating that MultiReAct significantly outperforms prior LLM-based methods on various long-horizon tasks. The consistent performance increases in success rates validated through evaluation metrics adds credibility to the proposed approach.

4. **Ablation Studies**: The inclusion of ablation studies to analyze the impact of specific components (like the reward function) on overall performance strengthens the paper. It conclusively shows the utility of feedback mechanisms in improving task accuracy and execution reliability.

5. **Clear Problem Statement**: The paper clearly identifies limitations of current methods, making a strong case for the need for enhancement in multimodal reasoning that the MultiReAct framework aims to address.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Technical Complexity**: While the framework's architecture and components are described in detail, certain aspects may be challenging for readers not deeply familiar with both the underlying theory and technical vocabulary. A more accessible explanation of critical concepts could help broaden the paperâ€™s audience.

2. **Limited Generalization Discussion**: The paper notes that MultiReAct displays strong in-task generalization but acknowledges a limitation in cross-task generalization. A more in-depth exploration of how the framework can be scaled or adapted to new, unseen tasks would be beneficial for the community.

3. **Performance Metrics**: While success rates and CLIP scores are informative, additional qualitative analyses (such as discussions of specific failures, example executions, and case studies) could provide further insights into the mechanism's performance and robustness.

4. **Computational Costs**: The paper does not address the computational efficiency of the proposed framework in terms of time complexity or resource usage compared to traditional methods. Evaluating the trade-offs of adopting MultiReAct in practical applications would be an important aspect for future work.

5. **Application Scope**: The paper positions itself well within robotic manipulation tasks; however, potential applications could be further discussed to illustrate the versatility of the approach across different domains, such as healthcare or service robotics.

#### Conclusion

Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of embodied AI by introducing an effective method for improving the reasoning and acting capabilities of LLMs. While it offers a robust theoretical framework and promising experimental results, attention to generalizability, readability, and practical implications would further enhance its impact on the research community. The proposed framework sets the groundwork for exciting developments, and future works that build on this foundation could explore broader applications and cross-domain adaptations. The paper is recommended for acceptance at ICLR 2024, pending minor revisions to address the highlighted weaknesses.
