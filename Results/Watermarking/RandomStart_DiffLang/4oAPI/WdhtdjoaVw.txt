### Review of "Functional Wasserstein Bridge Inference for Bayesian Deep Learning"

**Summary:**
The paper introduces a novel approach to Bayesian deep learning, termed Functional Wasserstein Bridge Inference (FWBI). The authors address the limitations associated with traditional parameter-space variational inference, particularly the issues related to using improper priors, intricate posteriors, and the pathologies linked to Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence in infinite-dimensional function spaces. FWBI offers a new functional-space variational inference method which employs a Wasserstein distance-based bridge to establish a more meaningful prior and well-behaved posterior distributions. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through empirical evaluations across various tasks, outperforming traditional variational methods.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach**: The use of the Wasserstein distance as a substitute for KL divergence in the context of function-space variational inference is a significant contribution. This methodological shift could potentially resolve many of the existing issues with current Bayesian deep learning frameworks.
 
2. **Theoretical Rigor**: The authors provide a solid theoretical foundation for the proposed method, demonstrating that the FWBI variational objective is a lower bound of the model evidence. This is crucial for asserting its validity as a credible inference method in Bayesian learning.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: The extensive experimentation across various machine learning tasks (multivariate regression, contextual bandits, extrapolation, and classification) indicates that FWBI consistently outperforms both parameter-space and function-space approaches. This validity across diverse settings enhances the generalizability of the proposed inference method.

4. **Clarification of Previous Work**: The paper effectively contextualizes FWBI within the broader literature, clearly identifying the shortcomings of traditional methods and articulating how FWBI addresses these issues.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity of Implementation**: While the theoretical basis is compelling, the implementation details, particularly regarding the Wasserstein bridge and the need for careful parameter tuning, may pose challenges for practitioners. The paper could benefit from more detailed guidance or examples concerning practical applications and implementation specifics.

2. **Ambiguity on Computational Efficiency**: Although the paper asserts that FWBI is efficient in its runtime, a detailed runtime comparison with baseline methods on large datasets would bolster the claims regarding FWBI's scalability. Including scalability examples could provide stronger evidence for its practicality.

3. **Sensitivity or Robustness Analysis**: While the authors discuss the stochastic nature of the bridging distribution, more emphasis on the method's sensitivity to hyperparameter choices and other assumptions would improve the robustness of their claims. Including a sensitivity analysis or robustness checks against various model configurations could enrich the findings.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Include additional empirical studies highlighting the impacts of hyperparameter settings and different functional prior alternatives on performance.
- Elaborate on the computational resources required for FWBI calculations, accompanied by tests on larger or more complex datasets to illustrate scalability.
- Provide sample code or a reproducible framework to facilitate researchers in applying FWBI to their own problems.

**Conclusion:**
The authors present a well-structured and impactful contribution to the field of Bayesian deep learning through the development of Functional Wasserstein Bridge Inference. The novel approach, grounded in robust theoretical analysis and demonstrated through comprehensive empirical validation, addresses significant limitations in the current literature. With additional work addressing implementation and robustness, FWBI could significantly influence future research and applications in this domain. I recommend acceptance pending revisions to strengthen the implementation and empirical robustness aspects of the paper.
