**Review of "A Counterfactual-Based Approach to Prevent Crowding in Intelligent Subway Systems"**

**Overview:**
This manuscript addresses a significant challenge faced by public transportation systems, particularly subway networks: overcrowding. By employing explainable AI (XAI) techniques, the authors propose a counterfactual framework aimed at predicting crowding conditions and suggesting actionable measures to mitigate them. The approach leverages rule-based models combined with counterfactual explanations, utilizing a detailed dataset derived from simulations of the De Ferrari Hitachi subway station in Genoa, Italy.

**Strengths:**
1. **Relevance of the Topic:** The issue of crowding in public transportation is highly relevant, particularly in the context of increasing urbanization and the push for sustainable public transport solutions. The integration of AI in addressing these issues is novel and timely.

2. **Use of Explainable AI:** The choice to employ explainable models and, specifically, counterfactual explanations is commendable. This allows for transparency in model predictions and offers insights that can be easily interpreted and acted upon by transportation experts.

3. **Rigorous Methodology:** The use of agent-based simulations to create a rich dataset is well justified. The resultant dataset of over 12,000 simulations provides a robust foundation for the analysis and the development of predictive models.

4. **Expert Evaluation:** Incorporating feedback from transportation experts adds validity to the work. This engagement enhances the practical applicability of the proposed solutions and suggests meaningful interactions between AI outputs and real-world decision-making.

5. **Quantitative and Qualitative Assessment:** The paper combines quantitative evaluations of model performance with qualitative assessments of counterfactual suggestions, bridging the gap between theoretical model outputs and practical implications.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Specificity of the Case Study:** While focusing on a single subway station (De Ferrari Hitachi) allows for in-depth analysis, the findings may not be directly generalizable to other subway systems or urban contexts without further validation. Additional scenarios or comparative studies involving different stations would strengthen the paper.

2. **Crowding Threshold Selection:** The selection of a critical crowding threshold of 30 people may seem low for certain contexts. While this threshold is justified by the specific conditions of the study, a discussion on how varying thresholds could affect model performance and counterfactual suggestions could provide a more nuanced understanding.

3. **Limited Scope of Features:** Although the study includes several relevant features for the model, future work could explore the incorporation of additional variables, such as external factors (e.g., local events) or weather conditions, which could also influence crowding patterns.

4. **Technical Complexity:** The implementation details of the Logic Learning Machine (LLM) could be further elaborated upon to aid readers who may not be familiar with the specific methodologies used. This would enhance the manuscript's accessibility without diluting its technical rigor.

5. **Counterfactual Realism vs. Implementability:** While experts found the counterfactual suggestions realistic, there was variance in their applicability based on logistical constraints. The authors may want to address how their approach can adapt to these constraints or suggest avenues for operational feasibility testing.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this manuscript makes a significant contribution to the field of public transportation management through the innovative application of XAI techniques to a critical issue. The strength of the methodology, combined with expert validation, provides a solid foundation for further research in this area. With additional work addressing the mentioned weaknesses, particularly in terms of generalizability and practical implementation, this research has the potential to substantially impact how urban transportation systems manage crowding effectively. I encourage the authors to consider these points in their revision.
