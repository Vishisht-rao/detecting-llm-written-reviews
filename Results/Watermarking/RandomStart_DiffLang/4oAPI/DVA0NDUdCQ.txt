### Review of the Paper "Efficient Large Language Models Fine-Tuning on Graphs"

#### Summary
This paper proposes a novel method called LEADING for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on text-attributed graphs (TAGs). The authors identify significant efficiency issues in existing methods of integrating LLMs and graph neural networks (GNNs), particularly concerning computation and data efficiency. LEADING attempts to solve these issues by decoupling the encoding of target nodes and neighbor nodes into two pipelines, thereby reducing redundant computations and maintaining memory efficiency. The authors provide a thorough experimental validation that demonstrates the superior performance of LEADING in terms of both data and computation efficiency compared to existing methods.

#### Strengths

1. **Relevance and Timeliness**: The integration of LLMs and GNNs is a rapidly evolving field with significant implications across various applications. The focus on improving efficiency is particularly timely, given the increasing size and complexity of models and datasets.

2. **Novelty**: The proposed LEADING method offers a fresh approach by addressing the limitations of prior architectures, particularly the cascaded and iterative structures which fail to capture graph structural information optimally. The two-pipeline approach for neighbor decoupling is a novel contribution which could significantly enhance the efficiency of LLM-GNN training.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The authors conduct extensive experiments on established datasets (e.g., Cora, PubMed, ogbn-arxiv) and provide detailed analyses regarding both prediction performance and computational efficiency. The results clearly demonstrate that LEADING outperforms existing methods, particularly in low-data regimes.

4. **Clear Complexity Analysis**: A well-structured complexity analysis highlights the scalability of the proposed method. This kind of analysis is crucial for understanding model performance in practical applications, and the authors do a commendable job in this regard.

5. **Potential for Real-World Applications**: The findings and proposed methods have potential applications in various domains such as recommendation systems, social networks, and knowledge graphs, making the paper's contributions quite significant.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Clarity of Methodology**: While the methodology section delves into the details of the proposed LEADING algorithm, it may benefit from clearer exposition, particularly for readers less familiar with the nuances of LLMs and GNNs. For example, the rationale behind certain design choices could be elaborated upon for clarity.

2. **Assumption of Node Stability**: The assumption that LLM embeddings do not change rapidly during the fine-tuning phase may not hold in all real-world scenarios. This could limit the applicability of the proposed method depending on the nature of the TAGs being processed.

3. **Limited Analysis on Broader Impact**: While the paper focuses on computational efficiency and prediction accuracy, it could further explore the broader implications of these improvements, such as societal impacts, ethical considerations, or environmental effects resulting from the increasing computational demands of machine learning models.

4. **Comparative Baselines**: Although the paper builds on existing LLM fine-tuning strategies, it could benefit from including more comparative analyses against recent state-of-the-art methods that may have emerged since the initial drafts of these techniques.

#### Conclusion
Overall, this paper presents a well-motivated approach to enhancing the fine-tuning of LLMs on TAGs, addressing significant efficiency challenges faced by existing methods. The proposed LEADING algorithm demonstrates promising results and is supported by comprehensive experiments. Clarifications in methodology and broader discussions could enhance its impact and accessibility. With its strengths and the potential to influence future research and applications, this paper is a valuable contribution to the fields of both natural language processing and graph-based learning.
