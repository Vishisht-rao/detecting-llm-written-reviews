### Review of "FAIRNESS WITHOUT SENSITIVE ATTRIBUTES: VIANOISE AND UNCERTAIN PREDICTIONS"

#### Summary
The paper presents a novel approach titled "Reckoner," which aims to enhance model fairness in machine learning without relying on sensitive attributes, reflecting the increasing concerns around data privacy. The authors observe that existing fairness-enhancing methods often use sensitive attribute data, which is becoming harder to access due to regulatory restrictions. Their framework utilizes a confidence-based hierarchical architecture of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) that introduces learnable noise and employs a dual-model system for sharing knowledge between high- and low-confidence subsets. The approach is evaluated against two well-known datasets, the COMPAS dataset and the New Adult dataset, demonstrating improvements in both accuracy and fairness metrics over state-of-the-art methods.

#### Strengths
1. **Novelty**: The proposed method distinguishes itself by addressing the challenge of fairness in the absence of sensitive attributes, a timely and crucial concern given the growing restrictions on data usage.

2. **Comprehensive Analysis**: The exploratory data analysis on the COMPAS dataset provides a strong foundation for the proposed methodology. The identification of biases in non-sensitive attributes based on model confidence levels adds valuable insights.

3. **Dual Model System**: The dual-model approach that includes learnable noise and knowledge sharing between models is innovative and effectively supports the goal of enhancing fairness while preserving predictive performance.

4. **Extensive Evaluation**: The paper includes rigorous experimentation on two benchmark datasets, allowing for a robust comparison with existing fairness methods. The results demonstrate significant improvements in key fairness metrics.

5. **Clear Contributions**: The main contributions are articulated well, highlighting the novelty of both the framework and the underlying methodology.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Complexity of Implementation**: While the novel structures and mechanisms are advantageous, they also introduce complexity. The use of learnable noise and dual-model systems may lead to challenges in implementation and scalability, which should be addressed more explicitly.

2. **Trade-off Discussion**: The authors briefly touch upon the trade-off between accuracy and fairness. It would be beneficial to provide a more detailed analysis or empirical exploration of this trade-off and its implications for real-world applications.

3. **Limited Baselines**: While the paper compares Reckoner against relevant methods, the selection of baselines could be more comprehensive. Including a wider range of existing fairness methods might better contextualize the performance of Reckoner.

4. **Generalizability**: Although the authors claim that their framework is more generalizable, further investigation into its performance across different datasets and problem types beyond COMPAS and New Adult would strengthen this assertion.

5. **Ablation Study Insights**: The ablation study provides useful insights into the contribution of each component of the proposed method. However, the results could be more systematically presented, possibly through organized tables or graphs that underscore the differences clearly.

#### Conclusion
In conclusion, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of machine learning fairness by introducing Reckoner, a framework capable of improving fairness without sensitive attribute usage. The methodology and analysis reveal profound insights into how non-sensitive information can implicitly carry biases and how these can be mitigated through innovative approaches. Despite some weaknesses related to complexity, baseline comparisons, and generalizability, the paper is a noteworthy addition to the current discourses surrounding fairness in machine learning. I recommend acceptance with the suggestion that the authors consider addressing the noted weaknesses in revisions.
