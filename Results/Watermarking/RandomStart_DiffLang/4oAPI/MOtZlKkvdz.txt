**Review of "ARE LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS POST HOC EXPLAINERS?"**

**Overall Assessment:**
This paper presents an innovative framework to investigate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) as post hoc explainers for machine learning predictions. The authors introduce four distinct prompting strategies—Perturbation-based ICL, Prediction-based ICL, Instruction-based ICL, and Explanation-based ICL—to leverage the in-context learning (ICL) ability of LLMs. The authors conduct rigorous experiments across various real-world tabular datasets and demonstrate that LLMs can generate explanations that are competitive with traditional post hoc explanation methods. Overall, the work offers significant insights into the potential of LLMs in the domain of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI).

**Strengths:**
1. **Novel Contribution**: The paper is one of the first to systematically explore the utility of LLMs as post hoc explainers in the context of other predictive models, thus addressing an important gap in the existing literature.
  
2. **Comprehensive Framework**: The authors effectively structure their framework around different prompting strategies, allowing for a thorough investigation of the various ways LLMs can be utilized to generate explanations. This methodological rigor enhances the paper's contribution to the field.

3. **Rigorous Evaluation**: The experiments are extensive, utilizing multiple datasets and ML models, thereby providing a robust evaluation of the proposed framework. The clear reporting of performance metrics, including Feature Agreement (FA), Rank Agreement (RA), and Prediction Gap metrics, strengthens the findings.

4. **Positive Experimental Results**: The results indicate that LLM-generated explanations perform on par with, and in some cases better than, existing state-of-the-art post hoc explanation methods. This suggests practical implications that can benefit researchers and practitioners in the XAI space.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Discussion Depth**: While the findings are promising, the discussion surrounding the implications of these results could be elaborated. The authors could engage more deeply with the potential limitations of LLMs as explainers, especially concerning their reliability and interpretability when used in sensitive domains.

2. **Understanding of Mechanisms**: The explanations produced by LLMs may not fully capture the mechanistic understanding of model predictions. The authors briefly mention that LLMs struggle with mechanistic explanations, but further exploration into how to bridge this gap would enhance the paper.

3. **Generalizability of Results**: The generalizability of the results to other types of models beyond the ones tested (logistic regression and ANN) remains uncertain. A more explicit discussion of the applicability of LLM-based explanation methods to other model types and datasets would be beneficial.

4. **Implementation Details**: While the experimental methodology is strong, the specific implementation details, including model architectures and the generation of perturbations, could have been provided in a more structured manner to facilitate replicability.

**Conclusion:**
This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of explainable AI by exploring the potential of LLMs as post hoc explainers. The provided framework and the resulting empirical findings are valuable, paving the way for future research in this area. However, the paper could benefit from a deeper exploration of the discussion points raised above. Overall, I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to enhance clarity and depth in the discussion sections.
