### Review of “LITEFORMER: LIGHTWEIGHT EVOFORMER FOR PROTEIN STRUCTURE PREDICTION”

**Summary:**
The paper presents Liteformer, an innovative and lightweight variant of the Evoformer architecture initially introduced in AlphaFold2, specifically designed for protein structure prediction. The authors aim to address the issues of high memory consumption and computational inefficiency associated with the attention mechanism in Evoformer, particularly concerning sequence length \(L\) and the number of Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSA) sequences \(s\). They claim to reduce the complexity from \(O(L^3 + sL^2)\) to \(O(L^2 + sL)\), thereby facilitating the analysis of longer protein sequences without encountering out-of-memory (OOM) issues. The introduced Bias-aware Flow Attention (BFA) mechanism is central to achieving these improvements.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty and Relevance:** The research addresses a significant challenge in the field of computational biology and protein design, making it highly relevant. The methodology for improving the memory efficiency of transformer models in this context is innovative.
  
2. **Results:** The experimental results reported demonstrate substantial improvements in memory usage and training speed (up to 44% reduction in memory and 23% acceleration in training speed), preserving competitive accuracy across various benchmarks. This informs the potential utility of the Liteformer architecture for practical protein structure prediction tasks.

3. **Extensiveness of Experiments:** The authors conducted extensive experiments across monomeric and multimeric protein datasets and provided comprehensive evaluations using various metrics (TM-score, RMSD, DockQ, etc.), ensuring robustness and reliability in the reported results.

4. **Clear Presentation:** The manuscript is well-organized, with logical flow and clarity across sections. Notations are clearly defined, and figures effectively illustrate the comparative advantages of Liteformer over the original Evoformer.

5. **Theoretical Foundation:** The introduction of the BFA mechanism is well-grounded in flow network theory, providing a solid theoretical background that could inspire further developments in linear attention mechanisms.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Comparative Analysis with Other Models:** While the paper focuses on Liteformer and Evoformer, a comparative analysis with other efficient transformer variants (e.g., Performer, Linformer) and methods utilizing non-linear attention could provide deeper insights into its relative performance and position in the existing literature.

2. **Ablation Study Detail:** Although some ablation studies are provided, further exploration could enhance the analysis. Specifically, a more detailed examination of how different components of BFA contribute to performance could benefit the readers in understanding the trade-offs involved better.

3. **Application Scope:** The discussion on the potential applications of Liteformer could be expanded. For instance, it would be beneficial to discuss how the innovations presented here could be extended to other domains beyond protein structure prediction.

4. **Thoroughness of Baselines:** In the performance comparisons, the authors mainly reference AlphaFold2 and Evoformer. Including a broader range of baselines that incorporate various methodologies and data structures could provide a more robust framework for performance assessment.

5. **Generalization to Different Datasets:** While the model performs well on the chosen datasets, the authors could discuss the framework's ability to generalize to various other protein prediction scenarios with different characteristics or complexities.

**Conclusion:**
The paper provides a significant contribution to the field of protein structure prediction by enhancing the efficiency of transformer models, particularly addressing memory issues while maintaining competitive prediction accuracy. While the groundwork laid by this work is commendable, addressing the outlined weaknesses could further strengthen the findings. Overall, I recommend this paper for acceptance, with the request that the authors consider the feedback provided for a comprehensive revision.
