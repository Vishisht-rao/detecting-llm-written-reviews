**Review of "On the Posterior Distribution in Denoising: Application to Uncertainty Quantification"**

**Summary:**
The paper investigates the role of denoising in various applications and presents a novel approach to uncertainty quantification in Gaussian denoising. The authors derive fundamental relationships between higher-order central moments of the posterior distribution and the derivatives of the posterior mean. They exploit these relationships to propose a computationally efficient method for obtaining the principal components of the posterior distribution and approximating the marginal distribution along specific one-dimensional directions, all while utilizing pre-trained denoisers. The results demonstrate significant improvements concerning computational efficiency and memory usage.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach**: The paper introduces a novel theoretical relationship connecting higher-order posterior moments with the posterior mean. This is a significant contribution to the fields of denoising and uncertainty quantification, as it establishes a clear methodology for deriving richer information from pre-trained denoisers without requiring additional training.

2. **Practical Applications**: The proposed method is highly applicable to real-world scenarios involving denoising in diverse domains (e.g., natural images, microscopy). The ability to visualize uncertainty in image restoration tasks is particularly valuable for decision-making in critical fields like medical imaging.

3. **Efficiency and Scalability**: The approach is notable for its computational efficiency and its capacity to handle high-resolution images without the overhead of storing high-order moment tensors. The use of forward passes through pre-trained denoisers rather than requiring backward passes diminishes the computational burden significantly, which can be a critical factor in practical implementations.

4. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The experimental results present a wide array of applications demonstrating the proposed method's effectiveness. The comparisons against competitive baselines (e.g., posterior samplers and previous methods) reinforce the advantages of the authorsâ€™ approach.

5. **Clear Structure**: The paper is well-structured, following a logical flow from theoretical development to practical application with corresponding experiments. The use of illustrations (e.g., figures) to explain key concepts further enhances the accessibility of the research.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Theoretical Guarantees**: While the derived relationships provide a foundation for understanding the methodology, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the theoretical conditions under which these relationships hold (beyond "mild conditions"). Clarifying the scope of validity for different types of denoisers or noise distributions could further strengthen the theoretical contributions.

2. **Dependence on Gaussian Assumptions**: The theoretical framework is primarily based on additive white Gaussian noise conditions. The discussion on extending the method to non-Gaussian and real-world noise distributions is limited. Although the authors present empirical results for non-Gaussian scenarios, a further theoretical exploration of these cases would enhance the robustness of their findings.

3. **Numerical Stability Concerns**: High-order numerical differentiation, as utilized in their method, can be prone to numerical instability, especially with lower-precision computation. While the authors mention using double precision, further clarification or exploration of stability under various conditions would be insightful.

4. **Comparative Evaluation**: Although comparisons are made against other methods, a more quantitative evaluation in terms of uncertainty quantification performance (e.g., metrics like uncertainty scores or interval predictions) would provide a clearer picture of the advantages of the proposed method.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper presents significant contributions to the area of uncertainty quantification in denoising, with an innovative theoretical framework and practical applications. While some limitations regarding the theoretical guarantees and the method's applicability to non-Gaussian noise exist, the efficiency gains and the method's practical utility position it as a valuable advancement in the field. I recommend this paper for acceptance, with suggestions for addressing the noted concerns in future revisions or related works.
