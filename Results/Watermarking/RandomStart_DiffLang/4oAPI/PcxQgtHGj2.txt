**Review of "Pre-Training with Synthetic Data Helps Offline Reinforcement Learning"**

**Summary:**
The paper investigates the potential of synthetic data pre-training for enhancing offline reinforcement learning (RL) performance, specifically focusing on decision transformer models and conservative Q-learning algorithms. The authors challenge the prevailing notion that only pre-training with rich language data, such as the Wikipedia corpus, can drive significant improvements, demonstrating instead that simple synthetic data generated through straightforward mechanisms can achieve comparable or superior results in various tasks.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach**: The research addresses a critical question in reinforcement learning by exploring the effectiveness of synthetic data for pre-training, thereby expanding the toolkit available to researchers and practitioners. The outcomes suggest that meaningful improvements in offline RL performance can be achieved without reliance on complex or large-scale corpora.
   
2. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The authors conduct extensive experiments across multiple datasets, including D4RL Gym locomotion tasks. They employ robust comparisons between various methods, including decision transformers with different pre-training strategies and conservative Q-learning variants, making a strong case for the proposed approaches.

3. **Efficiency Demonstration**: The paper convincingly demonstrates that synthetic pre-training requires significantly fewer computational resources compared to traditional methods, which can lead to a wider applicability in real-world scenarios where computational efficiency is paramount.

4. **Clear Insights**: The theoretical insights provided regarding the equivalencies of the pre-training methods enhance the understanding of model behavior in relation to feature representations and optimization dynamics, adding valuable depth to the discussion.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Limited Discussion on Theoretical Foundations**: Although the authors offer some insights into the mechanics behind the observed improvements, a deeper theoretical exploration would strengthen the paper. Understanding why synthetic data yields comparable results to more complex methods could be valuable not just for this work but for the broader field.

2. **Generality of Findings**: While the results are promising within the tested environments and settings, there is little discussion about the applicability of the approach in diverse RL contexts or with more complex decision-making environments. Future work could explore the boundaries and limitations of these findings.

3. **Comparative Framework**: The experiments predominantly focus on pre-training against a baseline of language pre-training. While this is a valid comparison, more varied methods (including different synthetic methods or more complex real-world datasets) could provide a clearer context of where synthetic pre-training excels or falls short.

4. **Data Focus**: The paper relies heavily on synthetic data generated from simple Markov Chains and IID settings. While these approaches demonstrate effectiveness, there is an opportunity to explore more varied forms of synthetic data generation that may better capture the complexities of RL environments.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this paper presents a compelling argument for the utility of synthetic data in offline reinforcement learning through comprehensive experiments and clear demonstrations of efficiency. By challenging the predominant reliance on language-based pre-training, it contributes significantly to the understanding of pre-training methods in reinforcement learning. Future work could solidify these findings by addressing some of the theoretical gaps and exploring the applicability of the proposed methods across a broader spectrum of RL tasks. Thus, I recommend this paper for acceptance, subject to addressing these points in future revisions or explorations.
