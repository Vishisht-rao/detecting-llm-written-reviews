**Review of "Routing with Rich Text Queries via Next-Vertex Prediction Models"**

**Summary:**
This paper addresses the problem of routing on graphs using complex natural language queries. It proposes a novel autoregressive modeling approach based on transformer architectures to predict the next vertex in a route, thus aiming to create a scalable and effective routing framework. The authors present a multimodal architecture that integrates text-based queries with graph data and conduct experiments on synthetic graphs as well as real-world data from OpenStreetMap.

**Strengths:**
1. **Innovative Approach:** The proposal to use next-vertex prediction in conjunction with natural language queries for routing is a fresh perspective in the area. This method leverages the strengths of transformers, which have shown high performance across various domains, effectively adapting them for routing problems.

2. **Robust Experiments:** The authors conduct extensive experiments, including both synthetic and real-world datasets. They compare their model's performance to existing baselines, providing solid empirical validation for the efficacy of their approach.

3. **Scalability:** One of the main highlights is the scalability of the proposed method to handle large road networks without the need for distributed computing. This is a significant advantage over many prior works that struggle with the combinatorial nature of routing in large graphs.

4. **Generalization Capability:** The ability of the model to generalize to unseen graph topologies and complex query semantics demonstrates its practical applicability. This is crucial for real-world routing applications where users may express their routing preferences in diverse and nuanced ways.

5. **Clarity of Presentation:** The paper is well-structured, with a logical flow from introduction to experiments. Figures are used effectively to illustrate concepts like the architecture of the model and the experimental results.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Detail on Architectures:** While the paper discusses architecture choices, further details on the rationale for specific design decisions (e.g., choice of embedding dimensions, number of heads, etc.) would enhance clarity. More insights into how these choices impact performance could be beneficial.

2. **Complex Query Handling:** The paper mentions handling complex user queries but does not deeply explore how well the model performs with highly nuanced or ambiguous queries. Adding a qualitative analysis of the model's predictions on particularly challenging queries could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of its capabilities.

3. **Computation and Training Time:** The authors claim efficient training and inference capabilities, yet do not provide detailed computational cost analyses or training time comparisons concerning existing models. Such information would be valuable for practitioners considering implementation.

4. **Evaluation Metrics:** The reliance primarily on quantitative metrics may overlook qualitative insights. Including user studies or feedback from real-world applications could provide additional validation of the model's effectiveness and user satisfaction.

5. **Comparison with Advanced Baselines:** While the approach is validated against existing methods, the comparison may not include state-of-the-art deep learning approaches in routing tasks. Including such baselines could provide a clearer picture of how it stacks against the latest advancements.

**Conclusion:**
The paper presents a novel and promising approach to solving the routing problem using rich natural language queries through the lens of next-vertex prediction models. The authors have successfully demonstrated the potential for robust performance in routing applications. However, addressing the highlighted areas, particularly regarding architectural detail, evaluation metrics, and computational efficiency, could significantly strengthen the contribution. Overall, this work is a valuable addition to the literature in both natural language processing and graph theory applications. I recommend the paper for acceptance with minor revisions.
