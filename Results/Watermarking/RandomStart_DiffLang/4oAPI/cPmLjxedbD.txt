**Review of "APATH TOWARD PRIMITIVE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE: LMM NOT LLM IS WHAT YOU NEED"**

**Summary of the Paper:**
The authors propose an innovative approach to develop artificial chemosensing systems that could achieve performance akin to biological systems, specifically trained canines known for their acute olfactory capabilities. The central thesis is to apply Linear Mixture Models (LMMs) in analyzing hyperspectral data in a manner that emphasizes interpretability and cognitive development based on established psychological theories. The paper explores the cognitive stages of chemosensing inspired by Piaget's theory of cognitive development and suggests a structured path to achieving sensor capabilities that could surpass traditional analytical chemistry methods.

**Strengths:**
1. **Novelty**: The shift from deep learning approaches (e.g., LLMs) to LMMs in the context of chemosensing is a fresh perspective. The authors argue convincingly for the potential of LMMs in enhancing interpretability regarding chemical composition detection.

2. **Clear Theoretical Framework**: The adaptation of Piaget’s cognitive development stages to the chemosensing domain is creatively executed, providing a robust conceptual framework. This not only illustrates the progression of understanding in systems but also renders a theoretical structure that could be beneficial for future research.

3. **Technical Contributions**: The paper contributes significantly to the discussion around dimensionality estimation, presenting a novel algorithm to build synthetic datasets appropriate for LMM applications. The inclusion of a detailed algorithm (Algorithm 1) demonstrates a practical approach to model construction.

4. **Cross-disciplinary Relevance**: The relevance of the proposed methods extends beyond chemosensing, potentially impacting fields such as machine learning, neurobiology, and bioinformatics by suggesting new avenues for research and application.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity and Readability**: While the paper is rich in theoretical insights, it at times sacrifices clarity for complexity. Certain sections may be difficult for readers unfamiliar with the mathematical and statistical foundations underlying the proposed framework. More intuitive explanations and simplified visualizations could enhance understanding.

2. **Empirical Validation**: The reliance on synthetic datasets poses questions about how well the developed theories and methods will perform in practical, real-world scenarios. Future work should prioritize the validation of the proposed models using actual chemosensing data.

3. **Limited Discussion on Limitations**: The authors briefly mention alternative methods such as NMF and ICA not performing well, but a deeper critical analysis of the limitations of LMMs themselves, as well as the contextual applicability of the proposed theories, would strengthen the paper.

4. **Ethical Considerations**: The paper lacks a discussion on the ethical implications of developing such advanced artificial chemosensing systems, including considerations regarding potential impacts on employment or the environment, which is increasingly important in contemporary research.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Consider simplifying key mathematical derivations and providing more intuitive explanations to enhance accessibility for a broader audience.
- Integrate empirical results or case studies demonstrating the proposed methods in practical applications to bolster claims and provide concrete evidence of effectiveness.
- Expand upon potential limitations and challenges encountered in LMM applications to enhance the robustness of the discussion.
- Include a section dedicated to the ethical considerations involved in advancing artificial intelligence technology in chemosensing.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a compelling argument for the use of LMMs in developing artificial chemosensing systems and offers an innovative intersection of cognitive psychology and machine learning. While it has certain weaknesses related to complexity and empirical validation, the proposed theoretical framework and the insights provided are likely to stimulate further research in this promising area. I would encourage the authors to address the feedback provided to strengthen their submission for ICLR 2024.
