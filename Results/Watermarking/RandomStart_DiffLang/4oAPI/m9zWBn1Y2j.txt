### Review of "LIGAND CONFORMATION GENERATION: FROM SINGLETON TO PAIRWISE"

**Summary:**
The paper presents PsiDiff, a novel diffusion model for generating ligand conformations that incorporates both ligand-target interactions and ligand chemical properties. The authors argue that, unlike previous methods that solely leverage ligand molecular information (singleton approaches), considering ligand-target interactions leads to improved conformation generation. PsiDiff employs a unique mechanism of graph prompt learning to facilitate message-passing between ligand and target graphs and introduces the Target-Ligand Pairwise Graph Encoder (TLPE) to effectively integrate these interactions into the diffusion model. Experimental results demonstrate that PsiDiff significantly improves the quality of generated ligand conformations, achieving an 18% enhancement in Aligned RMSD compared to baseline methods.

**Strengths:**

1. **Relevance and Novelty**: The research addresses a vital aspect of drug discovery—ligand conformation generation—by proposing a method that integrates ligand-target interactions. This approach is timely given the increasing complexity of drug design and the limitations of existing methodologies that focus on single-molecule interactions.

2. **Methodological Innovation**: The use of graph prompt learning to bridge the gap between ligand and target molecular graphs is an innovative contribution that elevates the modeling capabilities beyond traditional singleton methods. The introduction of TLPE represents a significant advancement in the field of ligand-target interaction modeling.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their method against several baseline models, including GeoDiff and TANKBind. The results clearly indicate the benefits of the PsiDiff approach, with detailed metrics that enhance the credibility of the improvements claimed.

4. **Ablation Studies**: The inclusion of ablation studies adds robustness to the findings. By systematically analyzing the impact of various components (e.g., the LPMP block and chemical property guidance), the authors successfully demonstrate the effectiveness and necessity of their novel design choices within PsiDiff.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity and Clarity**: The paper's methodology section is dense and may overwhelm readers, particularly those less familiar with advanced graph neural networks and diffusion models. Streamlining this section or adding more intuitive illustrations could aid comprehension.

2. **Broader Context**: While the paper cites relevant literature, a deeper exploration of how the proposed method compares to emerging techniques in ligand-target interaction modeling would strengthen the discussion on its significance. More connections to existing methodologies beyond the referenced works would provide a clearer context for its unique contributions.

3. **Experimental Limitations**: While PsiDiff shows impressive results on the PDBBind-2020 dataset, the authors could expand their evaluation by testing their model on a more diverse range of protein targets and ligand types. This would help assess the generalizability of the model across various applications in drug discovery.

4. **Long-Term Implications**: The potential long-term applications of PsiDiff in real-world drug design scenarios should be discussed more comprehensively. Knowing how PsiDiff could be integrated into existing workflows or its scalability in high-throughput settings could enhance its practical relevance.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the paper presents a compelling advancement in the field of ligand conformation generation, highlighting the importance of ligand-target interactions in developing effective drug candidates. PsiDiff appears to set a new benchmark in this area, though it would benefit from clearer exposition and broader validation within diverse contexts. The authors are encouraged to strengthen their discussions on the implications of their findings and further contextualize their work within the evolving landscape of drug discovery technologies.
