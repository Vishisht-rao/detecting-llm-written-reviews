**Review of "Rethinking Counterfactual Fairness: On Which Individuals to Enforce, and How?"**

**Overview:**
This paper addresses an essential issue in the field of algorithmic fairness, namely the need for a more nuanced interpretation of counterfactual fairness. The authors propose a novel concept called "principal counterfactual fairness," which hinges on the idea that the fairness enforcement should vary depending on whether the protected attribute has an individual causal effect on the outcome of interest. This work builds on existing literature concerning fairness in machine learning, particularly from a causal perspective, and offers both theoretical and empirical contributions.

**Strengths:**
1. **Timeliness and Relevance**: The topic of fairness in algorithmic decision-making is increasingly significant given the wide-ranging impacts of biased algorithms in society (e.g., in criminal justice, education, and healthcare). The research tackles a critical gap in the literature regarding which individuals and attributes should be protected under fairness considerations.

2. **Conceptual Depth**: The introduction of "principal stratification" to refine counterfactual fairness adds substantial depth to the discussion. The approach wisely draws from causal inference literature, allowing for a more precise interpretation of fairness that is sensitive to individual circumstances.

3. **Methodological Rigor**: The authors derive statistical bounds and conditions necessary for achieving principal counterfactual fairness, and they propose a post-processing algorithm that minimizes changes to individual decisions while enforcing fairness. This rigorous analytical framework strengthens the paper's contributions.

4. **Empirical Evaluation**: The experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets are well-structured and provide compelling evidence for the efficacy of the proposed methods. The thorough comparison of the proposed method against existing fairness notions enhances the robustness of the findings.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Complexity of Implementation**: While the theoretical developments are mathematically sound, the complexity in implementing principal counterfactual fairness could present challenges in practical settings. Real-world application may require additional simplifications or guidelines to facilitate its adoption by practitioners.

2. **Discussion on Limitations**: The authors mention that the principal counterfactual fairness notion is partially identified but do not elaborate on possible strategies for addressing this limitation. Future work could benefit from exploring how to develop more robust identification methods or estimation strategies.

3. **Dataset Limitations**: The reliance on synthetic data must be acknowledged, as it may not fully capture the complexities of real-world scenarios. While the real-world experiments are valuable, additional case studies across various contexts (e.g., healthcare, financial lending) could offer broader insights into the applicability and adaptability of the proposed concepts.

**Clarity and Presentation:**
The paper is generally well-written, though the technical content may be challenging for readers who are not deeply familiar with causal inference or the intricacies of fairness in machine learning. A more accessible introductory section or visual aids (e.g., flowcharts) could help convey the key points and methods more clearly.

**Conclusion:**
This paper makes a significant contribution to the discourse on fairness in algorithmic decision-making by offering a refined understanding of counterfactual fairness through the lens of principal stratification. The ideas presented have the potential to reshape how fairness is conceptualized and applied in real-world contexts, although careful attention must be paid to implementation and practicality. Overall, it is a valuable addition to the field and warrants serious consideration for acceptance at ICLR 2024. 

**Score: 8.5/10** (Strong impact with minor concerns regarding implementation and clarity)
