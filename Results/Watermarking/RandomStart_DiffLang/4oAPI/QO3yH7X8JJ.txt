### Review of “Dissecting Arbitrary-Scale Super-Resolution Capability from Pre-trained Diffusion Generative Models”

#### Summary
The paper introduces Diff-SR, a novel method addressing the challenges of target-resolution super-resolution (TRSR) using pre-trained diffusion generative models (DGMs). The method aims to achieve effective image super-resolution by injecting controlled amounts of noise into low-resolution images before applying the reverse diffusion process of a DGM. The authors propose a concept referred to as the Perceptual Recoverable Field (PRF), which serves as a metric for determining the optimal noise injection level for various upsampling scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Diff-SR outperforms existing leading methods across multiple datasets while requiring no fine-tuning or additional training.

#### Strengths
1. **Novel Contribution**: The method presented in this paper does not rely on fine-tuning or distilling pre-trained DGMs, which is a significant departure from existing approaches. This increases accessibility and reduces computational requirements, making it valuable for practical applications in image enhancement.

2. **Potential Impacts**: The introduction of the Perceptual Recoverable Field (PRF) as a theoretical framework to understand noise injection is a significant contribution. It provides a quantifiable measure of the suitable noise level, potentially benefiting further research into image restoration and super-resolution.

3. **Experimental Validation**: The authors conduct thorough experiments across multiple standard datasets (DIV2K, Set5, Set14, and Urban100) and provide comprehensive performance metrics including FID, PSNR, and SSIM. The results convincingly show that Diff-SR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in high-compression scenarios.

4. **Theoretical Analysis**: The paper includes sound theoretical foundations supporting the methodology, which increases the credibility of the proposed approach. This is beneficial for researchers looking to build upon this work.

#### Weaknesses
1. **Clarity of Presentation**: At times, the paper’s clarity could be improved. Certain sections, particularly the theoretical analysis and derivations, may appear convoluted and could benefit from more straightforward explanations or visual aids to help the reader follow the mathematical reasoning.

2. **Limited Discussion of Practical Limitations**: While the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, there is limited consideration of potential drawbacks or limitations. For example, the extent of applicability across various scenarios beyond those datasets tested could be discussed.

3. **Comparative Context**: The paper does not provide in-depth comparative analyses with non-DGM approaches or other machine learning methods that may not require pre-trained models. This could be beneficial to contextualize how Diff-SR fits within the broader super-resolution landscape.

4. **In-depth Ablation Studies**: The ablation studies presented are insightful, but a more exhaustive examination of different noise injection levels or different architectures used within the diffusion process would strengthen the findings. The sensitivity of the model's performance to various hyperparameters could also be elaborated upon.

5. **Visual Examples**: While qualitative results are provided, the visual examples could highlight more distinct differences between the outputs of Diff-SR and competing methods. Additional examples could also enhance the narrative of the paper.

#### Conclusion
The paper presents a compelling and novel approach to image super-resolution using pre-trained diffusion generative models through carefully controlled noise injection. It makes a valuable contribution to the field and opens up avenues for further research and practical applications. However, improvements in clarity, discussion on limitations, and deeper exploration of various aspects of the proposed methodology could enhance its overall impact. Therefore, I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address these points.
