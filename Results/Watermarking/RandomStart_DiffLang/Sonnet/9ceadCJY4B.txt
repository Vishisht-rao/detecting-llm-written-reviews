OUTPUT:
The research investigates the problem of large language models (LLMs) exhibiting inconsistent judgments when faced with follow-up questions expressing skepticism or disagreement.  The authors propose a Follow-Up Questioning Mechanism (FUQM) inspired by educational questioning strategies, using three question types (closed-ended, open-ended, leading) in two forms (Direct, Progressive).  This mechanism is evaluated using two metrics, Modification and Modification Rate, across eight reasoning benchmarks with ChatGPT, PaLM2-Bison, and Vicuna-13B.

The experimental results convincingly demonstrate a significant decrease in judgment consistency across all three LLMs when subjected to the FUQM, regardless of initial accuracy.  The impact varies across benchmarks and question types, with leading questions generally causing the most substantial drop in consistency.  This finding highlights a critical vulnerability in LLMs' reliability and raises significant concerns for real-world applications.

The authors further explore the influence of sampling temperature and prompt variations on the observed phenomenon.  While temperature impact isn't conclusive, the effect of prompt variations suggests sensitivity to prompt tone, further underlining the instability.  A detailed error analysis provides valuable insights into the models' behavior when facing challenges, revealing patterns like modifying the question, providing neutral responses, or directly altering answers.

The paper's strength lies in its novel FUQM, which provides a realistic and relevant evaluation setting mirroring real user interactions, going beyond simple accuracy measures. The comprehensive evaluation across multiple models and benchmarks significantly strengthens the claims of universality.  The error analysis offers crucial insights into the models' internal processes.  The exploration of mitigation strategies, while preliminary, is a valuable contribution, suggesting potential avenues for addressing the identified weakness.

However, some aspects could be strengthened.  The limited discussion on the impact of temperature needs further elaboration and potentially more rigorous statistical analysis.  While the mitigation methods are promising, a deeper dive into why certain methods are more effective than others, along with more comprehensive testing across different scenarios and models, would enhance the paper's contributions.  The paper's contribution would also benefit from explicitly addressing potential confounders such as prompt length and complexity.  Finally, the paper would benefit from a more thorough discussion of the implications of these findings for broader LLM development and deployment.

Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution by highlighting a previously under-explored vulnerability in LLMs.  The proposed FUQM is a valuable tool for assessing LLM reliability, and the findings warrant serious attention from both researchers and practitioners in the field of large language models. The paper is well-written and clearly presents its methodology and results.  Minor improvements in some of the areas discussed above would further enhance its impact and solidify its contribution to the ICLR community.
