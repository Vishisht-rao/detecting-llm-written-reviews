OUTPUT:
The manuscript investigates the area of improving vision-language pre-training by addressing data redundancy and misalignment in web-scale datasets.  The authors propose DS-CLIP, a method combining data de-duplication (D3) and semantic enhancement (SE) to achieve this. D3 uses pre-clustering to sample a subset of data, aiming for diversity rather than completeness. SE employs LLMs and VLLMs to refine and augment text captions, creating a one-to-multiple image-text mapping.  The authors further introduce DCTM and MSTM training mechanisms for better representation learning.

The paper presents a compelling argument for addressing the inherent noise and redundancy in commonly used web datasets for vision-language pre-training. The proposed two-stage approach of D3 and SE is intuitive and addresses important limitations of current methods.  The experimental results, showing improvements across various downstream tasks (image classification, retrieval, object detection, and segmentation) with significantly reduced training time, are impressive. The ablation studies effectively demonstrate the contribution of each component of DS-CLIP.  The comparison to state-of-the-art methods is thorough and convincing.

However, some aspects could be strengthened.  The paper lacks detail on the hyperparameter choices for the clustering in D3. The effectiveness of the clustering method might depend heavily on these choices.  Similarly, more detail on the prompts used for the LLM and VLLM in SE would be beneficial.  Further analysis on the qualitative aspects of the generated captions would strengthen the claims about semantic enhancement and misalignment reduction.  A discussion on potential limitations, for example, the computational cost of using LLMs/VLLMs for large-scale data, would be valuable.

Finally, while the paper mentions the public availability of the code and data,  a concrete link or repository should be provided.  This is crucial for reproducibility and wider adoption.  Overall, despite these minor shortcomings, the manuscript presents a significant contribution to the field, offering a promising approach to more efficient and effective vision-language pre-training.  The findings are well-supported by the experimental evidence and the proposed method shows considerable potential.  I recommend acceptance.
