OUTPUT:
This document studies a critical problem in reinforcement learning: environmental generalization.  The authors propose a novel framework for understanding this challenge, highlighting a "non-optimizable adaptation gap" that hinders the ability of RL agents to generalize to unseen environments.  This framework provides a valuable contribution by explicitly modeling the decoupling of task-invariant and task-agnostic components within the state space, a significant improvement over previous models that often assume shared state spaces.

The proposed non-parameterized randomization (NPR) method offers a practical solution to address the adaptation gap.  By directly randomizing task-agnostic components in the training environment, rather than relying on parameterized environment models, the NPR method avoids the limitations of existing approaches like domain randomization. The theoretical analysis, culminating in Theorem 4.1, provides a reasonable justification for the method's effectiveness by showing that training with NPR approximates an optimizable lower bound for the adaptation gap.

The empirical evaluation is strong, demonstrating the superiority of NPR across diverse environments including MuJoCo, BabyAI, and Torcs.  The zero-shot generalization results on challenging, novel tasks are particularly impressive and showcase the method's potential. The inclusion of various baselines, including advanced methods designed for generalization, strengthens the comparison.  The ablation study further supports the importance of the randomization component.  The authors convincingly demonstrate the method's ability to handle environmental changes that go beyond the capabilities of existing techniques.

However, some clarifications would improve the paper.  The definition of the structurized state space (Definition 3.1) could benefit from a more concrete illustration, perhaps with a running example. The complexity of the theoretical analysis may be challenging for some readers; a simplified explanation or an intuitive summary of the key results would be beneficial.  Further detail on the implementation of NPR, particularly the specifics of the "soft randomizing" approach and the parallel learning algorithm, would be helpful.  Finally, while the authors mention limitations and future work, expanding on these areas, perhaps suggesting concrete directions for future research, would strengthen the conclusion.

Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning. The proposed framework and NPR method offer a promising solution to the challenging problem of environmental generalization.  The strong theoretical foundation, compelling experimental results, and clear writing style make this a valuable and insightful contribution to the ICLR 2024 conference.
