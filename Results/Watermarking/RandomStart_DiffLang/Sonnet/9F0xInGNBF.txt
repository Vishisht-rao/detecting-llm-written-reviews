OUTPUT:
This manuscript examines the key area of zero-shot video understanding, a challenging problem due to the high computational cost and scarcity of large-scale video-text datasets.  The authors propose VideoPrompter, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained generative models to enhance both visual and textual representations within existing vision-language models (VLMs).  This is a significant contribution, addressing limitations of previous approaches which primarily focused on improving only the textual classifier.

The core idea of using a video-to-text model to generate descriptive captions that capture spatio-temporal information is well-motivated and intuitively appealing.  The integration of these descriptions with visual features through a weighted average is a simple yet effective technique. Similarly, the use of class-specific prompts for LLMs to generate richer class label representations is a sensible approach.  The introduction of a tree hierarchy for organizing categories into high-level action contexts is a novel contribution that appears particularly relevant for action recognition datasets.

The experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks and VLMs, supporting the effectiveness of VideoPrompter. The authors thoroughly evaluate their approach across three zero-shot settings: action recognition, video-to-text/text-to-video retrieval, and time-sensitive video tasks.  The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the contributions of different components of the framework, such as the video-to-text model, the text-to-text model, and the filtering of video descriptions.  The comparison with CUPL effectively highlights the efficiency of VideoPrompter in achieving comparable or better performance with fewer prompts.

However, several aspects could be strengthened.  The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed framework. For instance, the reliance on pre-trained generative models introduces potential biases and limitations related to the training data of these models.  Furthermore, the computational cost of using LLMs at test time, while addressed implicitly, could be more explicitly analyzed and discussed.  A deeper analysis of the generated prompts and their impact on the results would be beneficial.  Finally, the reproducibility section should include specific details about the hyperparameters used and the exact versions of the libraries and software employed.

Overall, this is a well-written and well-structured paper presenting a significant advancement in zero-shot video understanding.  The proposed framework is innovative, well-evaluated, and shows promising results.  Addressing the minor suggestions above would further strengthen the paper's impact.  I recommend acceptance.
