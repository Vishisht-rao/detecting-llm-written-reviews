OUTPUT:
This manuscript focuses on a critical subject: text-driven whole-body motion generation.  The authors present a novel framework, HumanTOMATO, addressing limitations in existing methods by incorporating fine-grained hand and face control and improving text-motion alignment.  The proposed approach is innovative, tackling the challenging task of holistic motion generation effectively.

The paper is well-structured and clearly written, presenting a comprehensive overview of related work and clearly outlining the contributions.  The methodology is described in sufficient detail, making it easily reproducible.  The authors' use of a hierarchical VQ-VAE (H2VQ) and Hierarchical-GPT for fine-grained control and a pre-trained text-motion alignment model (TMR) are particularly noteworthy and represent significant technical contributions.  The introduction of new evaluation metrics, TMR-R-Precision(256) and TMR-Matching-score, for more accurate and challenging assessment of text-motion alignment is also a valuable contribution.

The experimental results, presented both quantitatively and qualitatively, demonstrate the effectiveness of HumanTOMATO. The comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines are convincing, showcasing the advantages of the proposed framework in terms of motion quality and alignment with text. The ablation studies provide further evidence supporting the key design choices.  The visualizations effectively illustrate the quality and alignment of the generated motions.

However, there are some areas for improvement.  The reliance on a relatively large dataset (Motion-X) for training raises questions about the generalizability of the approach to smaller datasets or scenarios with less data.  A more thorough discussion of the computational cost and complexity of the model would be beneficial. The qualitative analysis, while informative, could be expanded by providing a more systematic comparison of generated motion sequences across a wider range of text prompts, focusing on edge cases and potentially challenging scenarios.  Furthermore, the paper mentions limitations concerning the facial expression generation and natural language understanding aspects; addressing these limitations would strengthen the paper significantly.

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes several notable contributions to the field of text-driven motion generation.  The proposed HumanTOMATO framework is well-motivated, technically sound, and demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods.  The authors' contributions to both methodology and evaluation are valuable and warrant further investigation. With some minor improvements to address the mentioned limitations, this paper would be suitable for acceptance at ICLR 2024.
