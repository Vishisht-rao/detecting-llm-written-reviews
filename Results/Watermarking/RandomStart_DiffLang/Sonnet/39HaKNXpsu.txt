OUTPUT:
This paper introduces Flash-Diffusion, a sample-adaptive method for solving inverse problems using latent diffusion models.  The core idea is to predict the "degradation severity" of a noisy input using a severity encoder, then use this prediction to adjust the number of steps in the reverse diffusion process. This allows for faster inference on easier samples, while maintaining performance on harder ones.

The paper is well-written and clearly presents the motivation, methodology, and results. The authors convincingly demonstrate that sample-to-sample variation in reconstruction difficulty is a significant factor often overlooked, and that their proposed method effectively addresses this. The severity encoding approach is novel and intuitively appealing, leveraging the latent space of an autoencoder to quantify information loss. The integration with latent diffusion models is also well-executed, resulting in computational efficiency gains.

The experimental results are comprehensive, covering multiple types of inverse problems and comparing Flash-Diffusion against strong baselines.  The ablation studies are helpful in understanding the contribution of different components.  The visualizations effectively showcase the differences in reconstruction quality between the proposed method and baselines.  The discussion of robustness to noise and forward model mismatch is important and reveals limitations to be addressed in future work.

However, some aspects could be improved. The definition and estimation of "degradation severity" could be further elaborated. While the intuition is clear, a more rigorous theoretical justification would strengthen the argument. The choice of the specific loss function for training the severity encoder could be discussed in more detail. Additionally, the paper mentions that training the severity encoder is efficient, but a quantitative analysis of the training time compared to other components would be beneficial.

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of inverse problem solving. The proposed method is novel, effective, and well-supported by both theoretical motivation and empirical evidence.  The identified limitations are reasonable and provide directions for future work. I recommend acceptance to the conference.
