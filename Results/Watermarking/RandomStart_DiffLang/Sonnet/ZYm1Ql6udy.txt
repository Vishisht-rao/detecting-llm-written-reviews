OUTPUT:
The manuscript addresses the key topic of bi-clustering neural spiking activity, a significant challenge in neuroscience due to the high dimensionality and temporal complexity of the data.  The authors propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric method to simultaneously cluster neurons spatially (subject clusters) and temporally (state clusters) based on their latent trajectories.  This approach is a significant improvement over existing methods that often make restrictive assumptions about the data's dynamics or fail to consider the interplay between spatial and temporal structures.

The methodology is well-described, although some aspects could benefit from further clarification. The use of a mixture of finite mixtures (MFMM) for subject clustering and a sticky Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (sticky-HDP-HMM) for state clustering provides a flexible nonparametric framework.  The authors’ explanation of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm used for inference is thorough, though a more detailed description of the Polya-Gamma data augmentation and the label-switching solutions would enhance reproducibility.  The availability of the Python code is a valuable contribution.

The simulation studies convincingly demonstrate the method's ability to recover both the spatial and temporal clustering structures and the underlying latent trajectories.  The comparison between the Negative Binomial (NB) and Poisson models highlights the importance of accounting for overdispersion in neural spike data.  However, additional simulations exploring various parameter settings (e.g., different numbers of clusters, noise levels) would strengthen the evaluation.

The application to the Allen Institute Visual Coding Neuropixels dataset is insightful, revealing potential functional interactions between brain regions that were not apparent using simpler clustering approaches. The authors carefully discuss the limitations of the model, pointing out areas for potential future improvements.  The discussion on the challenges of model identifiability, particularly regarding signed permutations, is appropriate and acknowledges a key computational hurdle.

While the paper makes a solid contribution, several minor improvements would enhance its impact.  The graphical model in Figure 1B could benefit from being more explicit, possibly using different node shapes or colors to distinguish observed and latent variables.  A more detailed discussion of the prior choices and their impact on the results would be helpful.  Finally, while the authors mention the possibility of using variational inference for improved computational efficiency, exploring this as a part of the paper would further enhance its scope.

Overall, this is a well-written paper that introduces a valuable new method for analyzing large-scale neural spiking data.  The methodology is sound, the results are compelling, and the authors acknowledge the limitations of their approach.  Minor revisions addressing the points mentioned above would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact on the field.
