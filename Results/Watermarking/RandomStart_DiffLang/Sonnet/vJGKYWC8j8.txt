OUTPUT:
The paper addresses continual traffic forecasting in evolving networks, a crucial and timely problem.  The proposed Traffic Forecasting Mixture of Experts (TFMoE) model tackles the challenge of catastrophic forgetting by employing a mixture-of-experts architecture with specialized experts for homogeneous traffic patterns.  This approach is intuitively appealing and aligns well with the inherent structure of traffic networks.

The paper is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation.  The introduction effectively sets the stage, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches and motivating the need for a more adaptive solution. The problem definition is precise, and the proposed method is described in a logical and comprehensible manner.  The use of visualizations (Figure 1) is helpful in illustrating the core idea of the model.

The three proposed strategies – Reconstructor-Based Knowledge Consolidation Loss, Forgetting-Resilient Sampling, and Reconstruction-Based Replay – are presented with sufficient detail.  However, a more rigorous theoretical justification for these strategies would strengthen the paper.  The connection between the VAE-based reconstructor and the mitigation of catastrophic forgetting requires further elaboration. While the intuition is clear, a deeper dive into the theoretical underpinnings would be beneficial.

The experimental evaluation is extensive, employing a real-world dataset and comparing TFMoE against relevant baselines. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of TFMoE in terms of both accuracy and resilience to catastrophic forgetting.  The ablation study helps to quantify the contribution of each component of the model.  However, a more detailed analysis of the computational cost and scalability of TFMoE would be valuable, particularly in the context of very large networks.  The discussion of the number of experts (K) is insightful, but further exploration of the optimal selection of K, perhaps through a more systematic hyperparameter search, would improve the paper.

The appendices provide useful supplemental information, including details on the dataset, baselines, and implementation.  The inclusion of the source code is commendable and contributes to reproducibility.

While the paper presents a strong contribution, several aspects could be improved:

* A more rigorous theoretical analysis of the proposed strategies is needed.
* A deeper investigation into the computational complexity and scalability of TFMoE, especially for large networks, is warranted.
* More detailed discussion of the limitations and potential failure modes of the model would strengthen the paper.
* The discussion of the random clustering baseline is insightful, but it could be expanded upon to provide a more thorough comparison.

Overall, this is a well-written paper that tackles an important problem. The proposed TFMoE model is innovative and shows promise.  Addressing the suggestions above would significantly enhance the paper's impact.
