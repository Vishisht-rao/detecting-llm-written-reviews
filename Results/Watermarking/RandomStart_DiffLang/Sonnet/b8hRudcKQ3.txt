OUTPUT:
This document explores the subject of incentivizing participation in federated learning (FL) by allowing clients to bid for model performance tailored to their data.  The authors propose Alpha-Tuning, a framework that incorporates clients' monetary bids and their contribution to model performance (measured by a Mutual Beneficial Score, or MBS) into a weighted validation loss function. This weighted loss guides the selection of both hyperparameters and aggregation weights during training.  A post-training payment scheme then distributes rewards proportionally to data contribution.

The paper is well-structured and clearly presents the proposed method. The introduction effectively motivates the problem, highlighting the limitations of post-hoc incentive mechanisms and the need for a more dynamic approach. The background section provides a sufficient overview of relevant work in FL and federated hyperparameter optimization (FedHPO).  The core of the paper, Section 3, thoroughly explains the components of Alpha-Tuning: the MBS metric, the monetary quotation mechanism, the adjustable weights for validation losses, and the MarketFedHPO algorithm. The mathematical formulations are generally clear, although some parts might benefit from further simplification or illustrative examples.

The experimental section demonstrates the effectiveness of Alpha-Tuning using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The authors convincingly show how increasing a client's bid leads to improved model performance on that client's data, at the expense of performance on others.  However, more details on the experimental setup, especially the data partitioning strategy, would strengthen the analysis.  The presentation of results in Figures 2, 3, and 4 is clear, but further quantitative analysis, such as statistical significance tests, would enhance the rigor.  The discussion of the alpha value and payment mechanisms is helpful in illustrating the framework's functionality.

The paper's main strengths are its clear presentation, well-defined problem, and demonstrated effectiveness of the proposed approach.  However, several aspects could be improved. First, the computation of MBS involves training N+1 models, which can be computationally expensive. While the authors mention an approximation technique, further discussion of its accuracy and limitations is necessary.  Second,  the paper lacks a detailed discussion of the fairness properties of the proposed payment scheme. A deeper analysis of potential biases or unfairness introduced by the MBS metric and the payment rule would be valuable.  Third, the choice of CIFAR-10 and the specific data partitioning strategy might not fully represent the complexities of real-world FL scenarios with highly heterogeneous data.  Finally, a comparison with other incentive mechanisms in a more comprehensive experimental evaluation would further establish the superiority of Alpha-Tuning.

Overall, this is a promising contribution to the field of incentive mechanisms for FL.  Addressing the mentioned limitations would significantly strengthen the paper and enhance its impact.  I recommend acceptance pending minor revisions addressing these points.
