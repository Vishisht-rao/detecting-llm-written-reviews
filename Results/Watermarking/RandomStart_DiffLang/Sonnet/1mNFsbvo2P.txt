OUTPUT:
This manuscript examines an important problem in machine learning for healthcare: risk prediction when outcome data is missing due to selective testing. The authors propose a Bayesian model that addresses the challenge of estimating risk for both tested and untested populations, acknowledging the potential for bias introduced by the selection process.  The model incorporates unobservables that influence both testing decisions and outcomes, making it a more realistic representation of the complex data generating process in healthcare.

The key strength of the paper lies in the introduction of two domain-specific constraints: the prevalence constraint and the expertise constraint.  These constraints are well-motivated by the healthcare context and are shown both theoretically and empirically to improve parameter inference.  The theoretical analysis, while focusing on a specific (Heckman) case, provides a solid foundation for understanding the benefits of these constraints, and the proposition is extended empirically to more general model settings. The synthetic experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the constraints in improving both the precision and accuracy of parameter estimates across different model variations.

The application to breast cancer risk prediction provides a compelling real-world case study.  The authors perform a thorough validation of their model, demonstrating that the inferred risks predict diagnoses, inferred unobservables correlate with known unobservables, and the inferred predictors correlate with known risk factors.  The analysis of the testing policy is particularly insightful, highlighting the model's ability to identify potential suboptimalities in test allocation and racial disparities. The comparison to a model without the prevalence constraint underscores the importance of incorporating domain knowledge for avoiding misleading inferences.

However, some points warrant further consideration.  The theoretical analysis could be strengthened by extending it to the more general Bernoulli-sigmoid model used in the empirical analysis.  While the authors acknowledge this limitation, providing a theoretical justification for the observed empirical improvements in this more general setting would enhance the paper's contribution.  Additionally, a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the UK Biobank data and potential biases within the dataset would strengthen the interpretation of the results. While some robustness experiments are included, a more comprehensive sensitivity analysis exploring the impact of different prior choices and expertise constraints would further enhance the reliability of the findings.

Overall, this is a well-written and well-structured paper that makes significant contributions to both the theoretical and applied aspects of machine learning for selective labels problems. The innovative use of domain constraints, coupled with thorough empirical validation, makes this paper a valuable contribution to the field.  The proposed approach has the potential to significantly improve risk prediction in various healthcare settings and beyond.
