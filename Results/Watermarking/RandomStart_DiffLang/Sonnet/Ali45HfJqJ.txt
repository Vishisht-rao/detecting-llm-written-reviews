OUTPUT:
This manuscript explores the problem of observer uncertainty in the learning dynamics of zero-sum games, focusing on the evolution of covariances.  The authors connect the established concept of observer uncertainty in dynamical systems with the analysis of the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) algorithm in two-player zero-sum games.  This is a novel approach, leveraging the Hamiltonian formulation of FTRL to study the evolution of variances and covariances of cumulative strategies and payoffs.

The paper makes several contributions.  It demonstrates that differential entropy, previously used as a measure of uncertainty, is insufficient for capturing uncertainty evolution in alternating play.  The authors propose covariance matrices as a more suitable measure, providing concrete growth rates for continuous-time FTRL and its Euler and symplectic discretizations.  A Heisenberg-type uncertainty principle is derived for general FTRL, indicating a trade-off between accuracy in strategy and payoff spaces.  The theoretical analysis is supported by numerical experiments.

The strength of the paper lies in its novel application of Hamiltonian mechanics and symplectic geometry to the analysis of learning dynamics. The connection between symplectic discretization and alternating updates is particularly insightful. The theoretical results are rigorous and clearly presented, although some proofs are deferred to appendices.  The experiments provide supporting evidence for the theoretical claims, although more comprehensive experimental evaluation, potentially including different game settings and larger-scale simulations, would strengthen the paper.

However, the paper has some weaknesses.  The extensive literature review is helpful in contextualizing the work, but it could be slightly more focused.  Some claims, such as the superiority of alternating discretizations, require more thorough justification beyond the uncertainty perspective. The paper could benefit from a more explicit discussion of the practical implications of the findings. For instance, how can the derived covariance growth rates inform the design or tuning of FTRL algorithms?

Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the understanding of learning dynamics in games.  The novel approach, rigorous theoretical analysis, and supporting experiments make it a valuable addition to the literature.  Minor revisions to streamline the literature review and expand the discussion of practical implications would further improve the manuscript.  I recommend acceptance, pending these minor revisions.
