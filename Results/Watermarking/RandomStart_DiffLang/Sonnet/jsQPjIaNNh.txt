OUTPUT:
This paper investigates a significant problem: improving protein function prediction.  The authors correctly identify the limitations of solely relying on deep learning predictors, highlighting the practical importance of incorporating inter-protein similarity modeling.  The comprehensive benchmarking of retriever-based methods against predictor-based methods is a valuable contribution, clearly demonstrating the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.  The finding that retriever-based methods can achieve comparable or even superior performance to some predictor-based methods without massive pre-training is particularly noteworthy.

The proposed ProtIR framework is an innovative attempt to combine the strengths of predictors and retrievers.  The variational pseudo-likelihood approach using the EM algorithm is well-motivated and appears to be a novel contribution to the field.  The experimental results showing a 10% improvement over vanilla predictor methods are impressive and support the framework's effectiveness.  The authors effectively demonstrate that ProtIR achieves performance on par with PLM-based methods without the need for extensive pre-training, showcasing its efficiency.

The additional finding that incorporating structural information into PLM-based retrievers significantly improves performance is also significant.  The ensemble approach combining this enhanced retriever with a predictor achieves state-of-the-art results in two tasks, further highlighting the synergy between these methods.

The paper is well-written and generally easy to follow.  The methodology is clearly explained, and the results are presented in a clear and comprehensive manner.  The authors provide a thorough discussion of related work, placing their contributions within the broader context of the field.

However, some aspects could be improved.  The discussion of the limitations of the study, while present, could be more extensive.  For instance, a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of the ProtIR framework in comparison to other methods would be beneficial.  Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed exploration of the hyperparameter choices and their impact on the results.  A more in-depth analysis of why structure retrievers don't consistently outperform sequence retrievers would also strengthen the paper.  Finally, while the reproducibility statement is included, providing the code prior to acceptance would significantly enhance the review process and allow for independent verification of the results.

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of protein function prediction.  The proposed ProtIR framework and the findings on incorporating structural information into PLM-based retrievers are valuable contributions that warrant further investigation.  Addressing the suggested minor improvements would further enhance the paper's impact.
