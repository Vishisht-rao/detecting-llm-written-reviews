OUTPUT:
The manuscript explores a critical problem in geometric deep learning: the design of intrinsic Riemannian classifiers that are broadly applicable across various Riemannian manifolds and metrics.  The authors address the limitations of existing approaches, which often rely on specific geometric properties, by proposing a general framework based on the minimal requirement of the existence of the Riemannian logarithm.  This framework is then applied systematically to five families of deformed Riemannian metrics on symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds, leading to the development of five corresponding families of SPD classifiers.

The theoretical contributions are significant.  The derivation of the Riemannian margin distance (Theorem 3.3) and the subsequent formulation of the Riemannian MLR (Theorem 3.4) are well-motivated and provide a sound foundation for the proposed framework. The systematic study of deformed metrics on SPD manifolds is comprehensive and clarifies the relationships between existing metrics.  The extension of these metrics to parameterized families is a valuable contribution, offering increased flexibility and potentially improved performance.  The authors' demonstration that some previous works are special cases of their framework strengthens the claim of generality.

The empirical evaluation on three diverse datasets (radar recognition, human action recognition, and EEG classification) provides compelling evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approach.  The consistent performance gains compared to existing classifiers, particularly the significant improvements in human action recognition and EEG classification, are noteworthy.  The detailed description of the experimental setup, including preprocessing steps and hyperparameter selection, enhances the reproducibility of the results.

However, some aspects could be improved.  The authors mention the over-parameterization of the RMLR as a limitation, which warrants further investigation.  A more thorough discussion of the computational complexity of the proposed classifiers compared to existing methods would strengthen the paper.  The explanation of the hyperparameter selection process could be more explicit, clarifying the rationale behind the chosen values and the impact of different choices. Finally, while the appendix contains detailed proofs and supplementary information, a clearer roadmap to the appendix within the main text would improve the overall readability.

Despite these minor suggestions, the manuscript presents a strong contribution to the field of geometric deep learning. The proposed general framework for intrinsic Riemannian classifiers is novel, theoretically sound, and empirically validated.  The systematic exploration of SPD manifolds and the resulting performance improvements demonstrate the practical significance of the work.  The paper is well-written and clearly presents both theoretical and experimental findings.  I recommend its acceptance to the conference.
