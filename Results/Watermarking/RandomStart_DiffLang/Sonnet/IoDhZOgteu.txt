OUTPUT:
This manuscript addresses the exploration-exploitation dilemma in reinforcement learning, a critical challenge hindering the application of RL to complex, real-world scenarios.  The authors propose DEXR, a novel framework designed to enhance intrinsically motivated exploration methods by decoupling exploration and exploitation via two distinct policies.  The core idea involves an exploitation policy that guides the agent towards promising regions, followed by an exploration policy that refines knowledge in those areas.

The paper is well-written and clearly structured. The introduction effectively sets the context by highlighting limitations of existing curiosity-driven methods, specifically their sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning and instability issues. The authors convincingly argue that their proposed DEXR framework addresses these limitations.  The related work section provides a comprehensive overview of relevant literature, situating DEXR within the existing landscape of exploration techniques.  The preliminaries section lays out the necessary theoretical foundations.

The proposed DEXR framework is presented clearly, with Algorithm 1 providing a concise representation.  The authors justify their design choices – the use of two policies and the truncation probability – with logical reasoning and illustrative figures.  The explanation of how DEXR mitigates over-exploration and reduces sensitivity to hyperparameters is particularly compelling.

The empirical evaluation is extensive, covering various environments (MuJoCo locomotion tasks and custom navigation tasks) and intrinsic reward methods. The results, presented in Figures 3, 4, 5, and 8, demonstrate DEXR’s superiority over existing methods in terms of both exploration efficiency and robustness to hyperparameter variations.  The analysis of the results and the accompanying visualizations are insightful.  However, more detailed information on the experimental setup (e.g., specific hyperparameter choices beyond those briefly mentioned) would strengthen the reproducibility and overall impact.

The theoretical analysis, although concise, offers a significant contribution. The proof of Theorem 5.3 (deferred to the appendix) provides a theoretical guarantee for the efficiency of DEXR-UCB, a variant of the algorithm adapted for the least-squares value iteration setting. This theoretical underpinning significantly strengthens the paper's contribution.

Overall, this is a strong paper addressing a significant problem in reinforcement learning.  The proposed DEXR framework is novel, well-motivated, empirically validated, and supported by a theoretical analysis.  Minor improvements could be made by expanding on some implementation details and adding more quantitative results to the figures.  Despite these minor suggestions, I recommend acceptance of this paper.
