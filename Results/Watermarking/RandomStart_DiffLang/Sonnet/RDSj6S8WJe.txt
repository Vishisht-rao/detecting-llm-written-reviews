OUTPUT:
This paper makes two significant contributions to the field of reinforcement learning.  First, it rigorously demonstrates a fundamental limitation of linear MDPs: the feature dimension can scale with the size of the state space, negating the expected advantage of function approximation in many real-world scenarios. This analysis, supported by compelling examples, is a valuable addition to the literature and challenges the common assumption of state-space independence in linear MDPs. The authors' proof and corollaries clearly articulate the conditions under which this dependence arises.

Second, the paper proposes a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm, UC-HRL, based on a dynamics aggregation framework. This framework cleverly combines state aggregation and equivalence mapping, offering a more general and practical approach to leveraging hierarchical structures.  The algorithm is provably efficient, achieving a regret bound that significantly improves upon existing methods like LSVI-UCB when the hierarchical structure is present.  The theoretical analysis is sound and clearly presented, culminating in a well-defined regret bound.  The numerical experiments on the Block-RiverSwim environment convincingly demonstrate the practical advantages of UC-HRL, especially in scenarios with repeating sub-structures.

However, some aspects could be strengthened.  The paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the computational complexity of UC-HRL, particularly in comparison to the baseline algorithms.  Additionally, while the Block-RiverSwim environment is illustrative, exploring the algorithm's performance on a wider range of more complex and realistic tasks would enhance the paper's impact. Finally, a more detailed discussion of the hyperparameter tuning process for both UC-HRL and the baseline algorithms would increase transparency and reproducibility.

Despite these minor suggestions, this paper represents a substantial contribution.  The identification of the limitations of linear MDPs and the development of a provably efficient hierarchical RL algorithm with function approximation are both significant advancements.  The clarity of the writing and the thoroughness of the theoretical analysis make this paper a valuable contribution to the ICLR 2024 conference.
