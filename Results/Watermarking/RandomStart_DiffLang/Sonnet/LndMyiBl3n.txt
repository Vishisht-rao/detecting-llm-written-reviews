OUTPUT:
This paper investigates non-targeted restricted black-box attacks on graph neural networks (GNNs).  The authors address a significant limitation of existing restricted black-box attacks (RBAs): their reliance on homophily assumptions and high computational complexity.  The proposed SheAttack method tackles this by employing a modified Silhouette Score (MSS) as an objective function, aiming to reduce the distinguishability of nodes in the embedding space.  The use of MSS offers a more generalizable approach, applicable to both homophilic and heterophilic graphs, without requiring knowledge of labels or the victim model.

The paper presents a thorough theoretical analysis of MSS, supporting its generalizability claims.  The authors also introduce a scalable approximation of SheAttack to handle large graphs.  The experimental evaluation on synthetic (cSBM) and real-world datasets demonstrates SheAttack's effectiveness across different homophily levels, showing comparable performance to shuffled white-box attacks, which significantly diminishes the advantage of white-box access. The ablation study further validates the contributions of the different components of the proposed method.

However, several aspects warrant further discussion.  The dependence on K-means clustering is a limitation, as the choice of k and the inherent limitations of K-means might affect the attack's performance. The sensitivity analysis of k partially addresses this, but exploring alternative clustering techniques (e.g., density-based clustering) could strengthen the robustness of SheAttack.  The paper mentions the unnoticeability of the attack, but only provides a limited analysis on a single dataset. A more extensive study across multiple datasets, considering various unnoticeability metrics, is necessary to fully assess this aspect.

Despite these minor drawbacks, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of adversarial attacks on GNNs. The proposed SheAttack method offers a novel and effective approach to RBA, addressing a critical gap in existing research. The theoretical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluation convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed method.  The paper is well-written and clearly presents its contributions. The inclusion of a reproducibility link is commendable.  Overall, this paper is of high quality and deserves acceptance at ICLR 2024.
