OUTPUT:
This paper tackles the challenging problem of financial time series forecasting, a domain known for its high noise levels and unpredictable external influences.  The authors rightly point out the limitations of existing evaluation pipelines, highlighting the surprising effectiveness of a naive "LAST" baseline that often outperforms more sophisticated models using standard metrics like RMSE and MAPE.  This observation forms the core motivation for their proposed novel evaluation pipeline, which shifts the focus from precise price prediction to a more practically relevant task: determining which assets to buy and sell to maximize portfolio returns.  This approach, based on portfolio Sharpe ratio optimization, is a significant contribution and offers a more robust assessment of model performance in a financial context.

The introduction provides a strong overview of the challenges inherent in financial time series forecasting, including noise from algorithmic trading, the influence of exogenous events, and the dynamic nature of the market itself.  The literature review adequately covers existing datasets and forecasting models, though a more critical analysis of the limitations of prior work in relation to the proposed methodology would strengthen this section.  The methodology section clearly describes the construction of a large-scale dataset through web scraping, a crucial step in enabling the training of larger, more powerful models. The detailed explanation of the portfolio evaluation algorithm and its integration with forecasting models is well-structured and understandable.  The authors' justification for using the Sharpe ratio as the primary performance metric within their proposed framework is well-reasoned.

The experimental setup is well-defined, specifying the hardware, software, and hyperparameter choices. The choice of Transformer models with varying capacities allows for a good exploration of model size effects. However, the authors acknowledge limitations in the hyperparameter tuning process due to computational constraints, which could be addressed in future work. The input representation method, transforming raw price and volume data into relative changes and log-volumes respectively, is a practical and sensible approach for handling variations in scale across different assets.

The results section provides a thorough comparison of different models across both forecasting and portfolio metrics.  The observation that the LAST baseline consistently performs well according to traditional forecasting metrics further reinforces the need for the authors' proposed evaluation framework.  The analysis of the portfolio metrics is particularly compelling, demonstrating the potential of deep learning models for making informed investment decisions, although high variance remains a concern.  The discussion of the models' tendency to collapse to the LAST baseline is insightful and suggests avenues for future research into model architecture and training strategies.

The limitations section is a strength of the paper, honestly acknowledging the limitations of the experimental methodology, including constraints on hyperparameter optimization and the focus on deep learning models at the expense of simpler alternatives.  The conclusion effectively summarizes the key findings and proposes promising future directions.

Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of financial time series forecasting by proposing a more realistic and effective evaluation framework.  The development of a large-scale dataset and the empirical results demonstrating the potential of deep learning models for portfolio optimization are particularly noteworthy. While some limitations exist, they are clearly acknowledged, and the authors offer helpful suggestions for future research. The paper is well-written and structured, making it a strong candidate for acceptance at ICLR 2024.
