OUTPUT:
The manuscript explores a critical subject in the field of scientific machine learning: improving the accuracy and generalization capabilities of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs).  The authors address a significant limitation of conventional MLP-based PINNs – their inability to effectively capture temporal dependencies.  This is a valuable contribution, as temporal dependencies are crucial in many real-world physical systems.

The core idea of introducing a Transformer-based architecture, PINNsFormer, to leverage the attention mechanism for modeling these dependencies is innovative and well-motivated. The paper clearly outlines the methodology, including the pseudo-sequence generation, the spatio-temporal mixer, the encoder-decoder architecture, and the novel Wavelet activation function.  The description of each component is clear and understandable, and the accompanying figure effectively illustrates the overall framework.

The introduction of the Wavelet activation function is particularly interesting.  The authors provide a compelling argument for its potential as a universal approximator, drawing a connection to Fourier decomposition.  However, a more rigorous mathematical proof, beyond the sketch provided, would strengthen this claim and increase the impact of this contribution.

The experimental section is comprehensive, including a range of PDEs and baseline methods.  The results convincingly demonstrate the superior performance of PINNsFormer compared to these baselines across various metrics, including scenarios known to cause failure modes in conventional PINNs.  The authors also effectively show the flexibility of PINNsFormer by incorporating existing learning schemes, leading to further performance improvements.  The visualization of loss landscapes provides a helpful insight into the optimization process, although more detailed analysis of the landscape characteristics (e.g., quantification of the number and distribution of local minima) could further strengthen this section.

While the paper is well-written and presents strong results, there are some areas for improvement. The computational overhead of PINNsFormer compared to conventional PINNs should be more thoroughly discussed. While the authors mention the overhead is "tolerable," providing more quantitative analysis and a discussion of potential strategies for mitigating this overhead would be beneficial.  Furthermore, the choice of hyperparameters (k and Δt)  seems crucial for the performance of the model.  A more in-depth analysis of hyperparameter sensitivity and potential methods for automated hyperparameter tuning would enhance the paper.

Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field by presenting a novel and effective approach to addressing the temporal dependency limitation in PINNs. The proposed PINNsFormer framework, combined with the Wavelet activation function, shows considerable promise for improving the accuracy and generalization of PINNs in solving complex PDEs.  With minor revisions addressing the points mentioned above, this paper would be suitable for publication at ICLR 2024.
