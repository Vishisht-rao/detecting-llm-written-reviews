OUTPUT:
This paper addresses an important and timely problem: the disparate impact of quantization on the performance of object detectors, particularly concerning critical categories. The authors focus on DETR-based detectors and introduce the concept of critical-category performance, a fine-grained objective that goes beyond overall mAP.  This is a valuable contribution, as real-world applications often prioritize accuracy for specific object classes.

The paper's strength lies in its analytical approach.  The connection between Fisher information, loss landscape sharpness, and the sensitivity of different categories to quantization is well-motivated and supported by empirical evidence.  The proposed Fisher-aware mixed-precision quantization scheme and Fisher-trace regularization are logical consequences of this analysis.  The experiments, conducted on multiple datasets and DETR variants, demonstrate consistent improvements in critical-category performance, with a noticeable increase in mAP.  The detailed experimental setup and ablation studies further enhance the paper's credibility.

However, some aspects could be improved. The definition of "critical categories" is somewhat subjective and depends on the specific application.  While the authors provide a reasonable approach using COCO supercategories, a more generalizable method or a discussion on the limitations of the chosen approach would strengthen the paper.  Additionally, while the Fisher information framework provides a theoretical underpinning, the computational cost of calculating Fisher information for large models remains a concern. The paper mentions approximations, but a more in-depth discussion of these approximations and their potential limitations is warranted.  Finally, a more detailed comparison with state-of-the-art quantization techniques, beyond HAWQ-V2, would further solidify the paper's contribution.

Overall, the paper presents a novel and insightful approach to improving the performance of quantized object detectors.  The theoretical analysis is compelling, and the experimental results are promising.  Addressing the minor shortcomings mentioned above would significantly enhance the paper's impact and contribute to a clearer understanding of the intricate interplay between quantization, loss landscapes, and performance in object detection.  The paper is well-written and clearly presented, making it a valuable contribution to the field.  I recommend acceptance to ICLR 2024.
