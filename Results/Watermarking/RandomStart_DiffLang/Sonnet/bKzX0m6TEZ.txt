OUTPUT:
This study addresses an important subject: constrained bilevel optimization, a challenging problem with significant applications in machine learning. The authors propose a novel Inexact Bilevel Conditional Gradient (IBCG) method designed to overcome the limitations of existing approaches, particularly in the constrained setting.  The paper is well-structured and clearly written, presenting a comprehensive overview of the relevant literature and a detailed explanation of the proposed method.

The key contribution lies in the development of a single-loop, projection-free algorithm. This is a significant advantage over existing methods that often rely on computationally expensive projections or suffer from slow convergence rates.  The authors effectively demonstrate how their nested approximation technique improves per-iteration complexity, achieving a complexity of O(m^2) per iteration compared to the O(m^3) complexity of some existing methods.  The theoretical analysis is rigorous, providing convergence rate guarantees for both convex and non-convex hyper-objective functions.  The theoretical results match the best-known complexity for projection-free algorithms in single-level optimization, which is a strong claim.

The numerical experiments, while limited in scope, provide supporting evidence for the efficacy of IBCG.  The comparisons to SBFW and TTSA on both synthetic and real datasets showcase improvements in convergence speed and, in some cases, solution quality. However, a more extensive experimental evaluation with a broader range of datasets and problem instances would strengthen the paper's conclusions.  The authors should also discuss the sensitivity of IBCG to parameter tuning more thoroughly.  While they address this issue to some extent, a more comprehensive analysis of the impact of step-size selection would be beneficial.

Some minor concerns remain. The assumptions on the lower-level and upper-level functions are quite strong.  The paper would benefit from a discussion of the practical implications of these assumptions and how restrictive they are in real-world applications.  Additionally, the appendix, while detailed, is quite lengthy.  It might be helpful to move some of the less crucial technical details to a supplementary document to improve the flow of the main paper.

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes a valuable contribution to the field of bilevel optimization. The proposed IBCG method is novel, theoretically sound, and shows promise in practical applications. The inclusion of more extensive numerical experiments and a more in-depth discussion of the assumptions would significantly enhance the impact of this work.  The paper is recommended for acceptance, pending the minor revisions suggested.
