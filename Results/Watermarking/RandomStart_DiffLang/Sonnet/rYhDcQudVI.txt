OUTPUT:
This paper addresses a significant limitation of classifier-guided score-based generative models (CGSGMs): their susceptibility to poor performance with limited labeled data.  The authors argue that this stems from classifier overfitting, leading to inaccurate gradients that negatively impact conditional generation.  To mitigate this, they propose a novel self-calibration (SC) loss that regularizes the classifier by treating it as an energy-based model (EBM) and leveraging principles from score-based generative modeling.  This internal regularization scheme avoids reliance on an external unconditional SGM, unlike previous approaches like CG-DLSM, and can utilize both labeled and unlabeled data.

The paper is well-structured and clearly presents the motivation, methodology, and results.  The introduction effectively situates the work within the existing literature on SGMs and CGSGMs, highlighting the gap addressed by the proposed method.  The background section provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of relevant concepts, including diffusion processes, conditional SGMs, and the JEM framework.  The proposed methodology is clearly explained, with a helpful illustration (Figure 1) and a detailed comparison to related regularization methods.  The formulation of the self-calibration loss is mathematically sound and well-justified.

The experimental evaluation is thorough, encompassing a 2D toy dataset for visualization and CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100 for quantitative assessment.  The authors appropriately use multiple metrics (FID, IS, intra-FID, generation accuracy) to comprehensively evaluate the performance. The comparison to various baselines, including vanilla CGSGM, CG-DLSM, and classifier-free methods, is robust.  The results convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, particularly in semi-supervised settings with limited labeled data.  The supplementary materials further strengthen the paper by providing additional results and implementation details.

However, some points could be improved. The discussion on the unsuccessful attempts to directly extend JEM to the time-dependent setting (Appendix E) is valuable but could be more concisely integrated into the main text.  While the paper shows the superiority of the SC loss, a deeper analysis of *why* it outperforms other methods, potentially involving ablation studies or a more in-depth theoretical analysis, would strengthen the contribution.  Furthermore, a more detailed explanation of the hyperparameter tuning process, especially for the semi-supervised experiments, would improve reproducibility.

Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of conditional generative modeling. The proposed self-calibration approach addresses a crucial limitation of existing CGSGMs, offering improved performance, especially with limited labeled data.  The clear presentation, thorough experiments, and well-supported conclusions make this a strong candidate for acceptance.  Addressing the minor suggestions above would further enhance the paper's impact.
