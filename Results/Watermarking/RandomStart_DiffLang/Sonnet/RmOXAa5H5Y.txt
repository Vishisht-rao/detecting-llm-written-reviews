OUTPUT:
This paper presents an empirical study of simplicial representation learning using the Tree-Wasserstein Distance (TWD) within a self-supervised SimCLR framework.  The authors address the numerical challenges associated with training the non-differentiable L1 distance inherent in TWD, exploring various probability models (softmax, ArcFace, and Simplicial Embedding) and proposing a Jeffrey divergence-based regularization method.

The study's strengths lie in its comprehensive empirical investigation.  The authors evaluate multiple combinations of TWD variants (total variation and ClusterTree), probability models, and regularization techniques across several benchmark datasets (STL10, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN). This thorough experimentation provides valuable insights into the interplay between these components and their impact on model performance.  The proposed Jeffrey divergence regularization is shown to effectively stabilize the training process, leading to significant improvements in several scenarios.  The finding that ArcFace with DCT matrix outperforms cosine similarity in certain settings is a noteworthy contribution.  The theoretical connection between the robust variant of TWD and total variation is also a valuable addition.

However, some aspects could be strengthened. The paper's theoretical contributions are relatively limited, focusing primarily on the empirical observations.  A more in-depth theoretical analysis of the proposed method, including a clearer explanation of the choice of tree structures and their impact, would enhance the paper's contribution. The poor performance on CIFAR100 requires more discussion and potential explanations.  Is this a limitation of the TWD approach in high-dimensional settings, or are there aspects of the experimental setup that could be improved?  Further investigation into the sensitivity of the results to hyperparameters (e.g., temperature parameter τ, regularization parameter λ) would also strengthen the paper.  Finally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison to other state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods, beyond simply using cosine similarity as a baseline.

Overall, the paper makes a valuable empirical contribution by demonstrating the potential of TWD for simplicial representation learning, highlighting the importance of careful model and regularization choices.  However, the lack of deeper theoretical analysis and a more comprehensive comparison to existing methods limits its impact.  Addressing these limitations would significantly strengthen the paper and increase its suitability for ICLR 2024.
