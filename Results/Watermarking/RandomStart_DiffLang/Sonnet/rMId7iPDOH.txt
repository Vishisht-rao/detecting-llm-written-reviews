OUTPUT:
This paper tackles the important problem of robust novelty detection, aiming to identify semantically novel samples while being robust to irrelevant style changes.  The proposed method, Stylist, is a novel approach that leverages pre-trained feature representations and ranks features based on their distribution changes across different environments.  The core idea is to identify and remove environment-biased features that contribute to spurious correlations, thus improving the robustness of novelty detection algorithms.

The paper's strengths lie in its clear problem formulation, the well-motivated approach, and a comprehensive experimental evaluation. The introduction effectively highlights the distinction between novelty detection and general anomaly detection, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing relevant semantic changes from irrelevant stylistic variations.  The multi-environment setup is clearly explained and well-suited to the problem.  The Stylist algorithm itself is relatively simple and easy to understand, making it potentially attractive for practical applications.  The creation of the COCOShift synthetic dataset is a significant contribution, providing a valuable benchmark for future research in robust novelty detection with controllable levels of spurious correlation.  The experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple datasets and novelty detection algorithms, indicating the effectiveness of Stylist.  The ablation studies provide further insights into the robustness of the method to different hyperparameter choices.  The attempt to provide a glimpse into the interpretability of the selected features through synthetic and real-world experiments is also commendable.

However, there are some areas for improvement.  While the paper mentions adapting existing domain generalization datasets, more details on the adaptation process are needed. The random splitting of classes into normal and novel categories might introduce some bias, and a more principled approach to this splitting would strengthen the evaluation.  The assumptions underlying the Stylist algorithm (pretrained feature extractor capabilities and dominance of style changes) could be discussed more thoroughly and their limitations explored.  Finally, a comparison to more sophisticated feature selection or dimensionality reduction techniques beyond the few included would further solidify the contribution.  It would be beneficial to also discuss the computational complexity of Stylist, especially in comparison to other methods.

Overall, this is a well-written paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of robust novelty detection.  The proposed Stylist algorithm is effective and the experimental evaluation is thorough.  Addressing the minor weaknesses mentioned above would further strengthen the paper.  I recommend acceptance to ICLR 2024.
