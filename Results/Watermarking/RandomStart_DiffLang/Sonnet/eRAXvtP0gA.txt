Review of "Unsupervised Cognition" for ICLR 2024

This paper introduces a novel unsupervised learning algorithm, "Primitive," inspired by cognitive models of constructive representation.  The authors argue that existing methods, like K-Means and IIC, suffer from limitations in capturing cognitive relationships within data, focusing instead on mathematical space partitioning.  Primitive, in contrast, aims to build internal representations ("Footprints") that abstract patterns from the input data.  These Footprints are organized hierarchically, enabling classification and a unique "I don't know" response when input data doesn't match existing representations.  The algorithm incorporates an Embodiment (encoder-decoder pair) for input-agnostic handling of various data types and a Spatial Attention modulator for adaptive threshold setting.

The paper presents compelling empirical results demonstrating Primitive's competitiveness with K-Means and IIC in unsupervised classification tasks across tabular and image datasets.  The noteworthy achievement is its performance on MNIST, where it rivals IIC even with significantly fewer training samples and epochs.  Furthermore, the noise distortion experiment on MNIST showcases Primitive's superior robustness compared to other clustering algorithms, suggesting a genuine advantage in capturing cognitive-like relationships.  The superior performance in noisy MNIST, maintaining accuracy even with high pixel removal, is a key strength of this work and distinguishes it from more traditional approaches.

However, the paper also has weaknesses.  The explanation of the algorithm is complex and could be significantly improved with clearer diagrams and a more concise description of the Footprint update and activation functions. The mathematical details of the similarity function and the Spatial Attention mechanism are lacking, hindering a thorough understanding of the algorithm's inner workings.  While the "I don't know" capability is mentioned as a strength, the frequency with which this response occurs and its overall impact on performance needs further quantification.  

The ablation study is superficial. While the authors mention the Embodiment’s significance, the impact of parameter choices is not adequately explored.  A more comprehensive sensitivity analysis of key parameters (e.g., bin overlap, similarity function variations) would strengthen the paper.  The comparison with state-of-the-art unsupervised learning methods on ImageNet-1k is weak.  While the authors acknowledge their approach was run with a simplified greyscale version of the dataset and without data augmentation techniques, this severely limits the interpretability of their 0.092% accuracy. A proper comparison requires using the same data preprocessing and training conditions as other methods cited.

Despite these limitations, the core idea of constructing internal representations to capture cognitive relationships is promising and warrants further investigation. The superior performance in the noise-robustness MNIST experiment strongly suggests that Primitive’s approach to unsupervised learning may hold substantial advantages.   The paper would significantly benefit from clarifying the algorithmic details, providing a more thorough ablation study, and conducting a fairer comparison with state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet.  With these improvements, the paper would be a strong candidate for ICLR 2024.
