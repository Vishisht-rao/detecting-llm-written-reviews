OUTPUT:
This study explores a critical intersection between idempotence and perceptual image compression, two areas typically treated separately in the image compression literature.  The authors posit a novel theoretical connection: conditional generative models inherently exhibit idempotence, and conversely, imposing idempotence constraints on unconditional generative models yields perceptual compression. This core idea is supported by rigorous mathematical proofs.

The proposed method leverages this equivalence to develop a new paradigm for perceptual image compression.  Instead of training a separate conditional generative model for each compression level, it cleverly utilizes a pre-trained unconditional generative model and a standard MSE-optimized codec.  This significantly reduces training complexity, a major advantage highlighted in the paper.  The authors propose two methods for imposing the idempotence constraint (y-domain and x-domain), comparing their effectiveness empirically.

The experimental results are compelling, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in terms of FID, a key metric for perceptual quality.  The paper meticulously compares the proposed approach against several strong baselines (HiFiC, ILLM, etc.), including versions retrained on the same datasets for fairer comparison.  The results across multiple datasets (FFHQ, ImageNet, COCO, CLIC) consistently show the superiority of the proposed method.  Further analysis includes an examination of the MSE bound, PSNR, and exploration of the reconstruction diversity, which is a valuable aspect of the proposed stochastic approach.  The authors also address the trade-off between perceptual quality and distortion, showing a method to achieve a controlled balance.  The inclusion of KID and LPIPS results provides a more complete picture of the method's performance.

However, the paper has some limitations.  The significant increase in inference time due to the generative model inversion is a major drawback, potentially hindering practical applications.  The authors acknowledge this limitation and point to existing research aiming to address it.  The discussion about the resolution flexibility limitation is also appropriate.

The writing is generally clear and well-organized, making the theoretical contributions and experimental findings readily understandable. The paper's strength lies in its solid theoretical foundation, combined with convincing experimental evidence.  The ethical considerations regarding potential misrepresentation of faces are mentioned, though a deeper exploration of these concerns would be beneficial.

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes significant contributions to the field. The innovative approach to perceptual image compression, supported by rigorous theoretical analysis and compelling empirical results, warrants publication.  Addressing the inference time limitation in future work would further enhance its practical impact.
