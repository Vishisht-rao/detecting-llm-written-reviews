OUTPUT:
The manuscript focuses on a critical problem: extending the context window of large language models (LLMs) without sacrificing performance within the original context window or significantly impacting training/inference speed.  The authors propose Continuous Length EXtrapolation (CLEX), a novel method that generalizes position embedding (PE) scaling approaches by modeling the continuous dynamics of frequency basis using a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE). This allows for a more flexible and adaptive approach to context window extension compared to existing methods which often struggle to extrapolate effectively or maintain performance at shorter lengths.

The paper is well-written and clearly presents the methodology, including a useful unified view of PE scaling methods.  The experimental results are compelling, showing CLEX's ability to extend context windows to over 4x (and nearly 8x with a larger model) the training length without performance degradation in language modeling.  The evaluation on the LongBench benchmark further demonstrates the practical effectiveness of CLEX, achieving competitive results against state-of-the-art open-source models trained on much longer context lengths.  The ablation studies provide strong evidence for the importance of the key components of CLEX, namely the continuous dynamics and the position extrapolation strategy.  The negligible impact on inference latency is also a significant advantage.

However, there are some points that could be strengthened:

The theoretical justification for the effectiveness of CLEX could be further elaborated.  While the unified view of PE scaling is insightful, a deeper understanding of why the continuous dynamics learned by the ODE lead to better extrapolation is desirable.  A more thorough analysis of the learned dynamics themselves would be beneficial.

The choice of the constant dynamics from Yarn as ξt in the ODE seems somewhat arbitrary.  Further exploration of different choices for ξt and its impact on performance would be valuable.

The paper mentions the position extrapolation strategy to address inconsistency between frequency basis and position indices.  A more detailed explanation of how this strategy works and its impact on performance would be beneficial.

Finally, while the comparison to existing methods is comprehensive, including a discussion of the limitations of hierarchical architectures and sparse attention in the context of CLEX's advantages would further strengthen the contribution.


Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of long-context LLMs. The proposed CLEX method is well-motivated, effectively implemented, and shows promising results.  Addressing the minor points mentioned above would further enhance the paper's impact.  I recommend acceptance.
