OUTPUT:
This paper proposes a novel adaptive algorithm for bilevel optimization problems, a significant contribution given the challenges posed by the need to tune Lipschitz constants in existing methods.  The algorithm cleverly employs an "on-the-fly" accumulation strategy for gradient norms to adapt to both inner and outer levels without requiring prior knowledge of Lipschitz constants. This adaptive approach is a significant advancement, addressing a major practical limitation of current bilevel optimization techniques.

The theoretical analysis is rigorous, providing O(1/T) convergence rate guarantees for both convex and non-convex outer objectives. The authors prove these rates using a novel regret bound and demonstrate the stabilization of the outer step-size sequence.  The inclusion of asymptotic convergence rate results for the last iterate, particularly the stronger result under bounded feasible domain, enhances the theoretical contributions.

The numerical experiments in a reinforcement learning setting support the theoretical findings, showcasing the superior performance of the proposed adaptive algorithm compared to existing methods, including the tuned and untuned versions of the Ghadimi & Wang algorithm. The additional comparison against other state-of-the-art bilevel optimization algorithms on standard benchmarks further strengthens the empirical validation.  The inclusion of experimental details and code enhances reproducibility.

However, a few minor points could be improved.  The discussion of the hyper-constant Lf and its computational intractability could be more concise.  While the adaptive step-size policy's intuition is explained, a more detailed explanation of its connection to the strongly convex and smooth minimization settings would be beneficial.  Finally, future work should be more precisely defined; suggesting specific avenues of exploration beyond merely mentioning accelerated adaptive algorithms would be more impactful.

Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of bilevel optimization. The proposed adaptive algorithm is well-motivated, rigorously analyzed, and effectively demonstrated. The paper is well-written and clearly presented, making it a valuable contribution to the conference.  I recommend acceptance.
