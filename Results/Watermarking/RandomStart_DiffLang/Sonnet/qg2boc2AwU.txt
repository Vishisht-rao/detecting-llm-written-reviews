Review of "EBMDOCK: Neural Probabilistic Protein-Protein Docking via a Differentiable Energy-Based Model"

This paper addresses the challenging problem of protein-protein docking using a novel energy-based model, EBMDock.  The authors present a geometric deep learning framework that learns a differentiable energy function based on distance likelihoods between residues.  This approach offers several advantages over existing methods, particularly in terms of efficiency and stability.

Strengths:

The paper clearly identifies a significant gap in the current literature: the under-investigation of protein-protein docking compared to protein-ligand docking.  The proposed EBMDock framework addresses this gap effectively. The use of an energy-based model allows for a probabilistic interpretation of docking poses, providing a measure of confidence in the predictions.  The incorporation of Langevin dynamics for efficient sampling is a significant contribution, leading to improved performance and stability, particularly valuable given the limited availability of training data.  The authors convincingly demonstrate the superiority of EBMDock compared to several state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods, and also show its potential as a plugin to enhance existing one-point solution methods. The 100x speedup over traditional software is a compelling result. The ablation studies provide useful insights into the contribution of different components of the model.  The paper is well-written and clearly structured, with sufficient detail in the methods section.

Weaknesses:

While the results are impressive, a more extensive comparison against a wider range of traditional docking software would strengthen the claims.  The reliance on a rigid-body docking assumption is a limitation that could be addressed in future work.  The authors mention the challenge of data imbalance but don’t elaborate extensively on alternative strategies besides contrastive divergence. Exploring other methods for handling this could be beneficial.  The description of the intersection loss could benefit from further detail, particularly regarding the choice of parameters.  The discussion of future work, while promising, lacks specific details on how the mentioned improvements would be implemented.  The comparison with AlphaFold-Multimer might be biased due to different training data; a clearer explanation of the potential bias and its impact is needed.


Overall:

This paper makes a substantial contribution to the field of protein-protein docking.  EBMDock is a novel and effective approach that demonstrates strong performance and efficiency.  Addressing the minor weaknesses mentioned above would further enhance the paper's impact.  The proposed method has the potential to significantly accelerate and improve the accuracy of protein-protein docking, a crucial task in biology and drug discovery.  I recommend acceptance to the conference.
