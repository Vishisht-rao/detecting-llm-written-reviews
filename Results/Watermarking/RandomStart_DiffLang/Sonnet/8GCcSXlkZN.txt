OUTPUT:
This study addresses an important aspect of self-supervised visual representation learning, namely the limitation of existing methods like I-JEPA in capturing local semantics for dense prediction tasks.  The authors convincingly argue that I-JEPA's reliance on masked modeling in the embedding space leads to a deficiency in local semantic understanding.  Their proposed Dense-JEPA method is a novel approach to mitigate this issue by incorporating a "Masked Semantic Neighboring" module and a "Local Aggregation Target" module.  These modules aim to select semantically similar neighboring patches and aggregate their features to create a more informative target for masked patch reconstruction, thus improving the learned representations.

The paper is well-written and clearly explains the methodology.  The core idea is simple yet effective, and the authors provide a thorough description of the proposed architecture and its components.  The experimental results are extensive, covering a wide range of downstream tasks (ImageNet-1K classification, ADE20K semantic segmentation, COCO object detection, DA VIS video segmentation, and Clevr local prediction).  The consistent performance improvements over I-JEPA and other baselines across these diverse tasks strongly support the effectiveness of Dense-JEPA.  The ablation studies further solidify the contribution by demonstrating the importance of both proposed modules and the choices of hyperparameters.  The visualization of attention maps and cosine similarity maps provide valuable qualitative insights into how Dense-JEPA learns more localized and semantically coherent representations.

However, a few points could be strengthened.  The description of the cross-attention mechanism in equation (5) could benefit from more detail, perhaps including a diagram to illustrate the flow of information.  While the paper mentions the computational cost, a more detailed comparison with I-JEPA in terms of training time and resource usage would be beneficial.  Finally, the appendix contains supplementary materials that could be integrated into the main body to improve readability and flow.  For instance, some of the additional experiments and analyses could be selectively included to enhance the overall argument.

Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of self-supervised learning.  The proposed Dense-JEPA method is well-motivated, rigorously evaluated, and demonstrates strong empirical results. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.  I recommend acceptance.
