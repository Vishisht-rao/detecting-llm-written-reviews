Review of BrainLM: A Foundation Model for Brain Activity Recordings

This research focuses on a critical area: developing more effective methods for analyzing the massive, complex datasets generated by fMRI.  The authors introduce BrainLM, a foundation model trained on a substantial amount of fMRI data (6700 hours), which represents a significant advancement over previous approaches.  The paper clearly articulates the limitations of existing fMRI analysis techniques, highlighting the need for more generalizable and scalable models.  The choice of a Transformer-based masked autoencoder architecture, inspired by successful language models, is well-justified and appropriate for capturing the spatiotemporal dependencies in fMRI data.

The paper's strength lies in its comprehensive evaluation across various tasks.  The demonstration of BrainLM's ability to generalize to unseen datasets (UKB and HCP) is particularly impressive.  The results on clinical variable prediction and future brain state forecasting, consistently outperforming established methods, are compelling.  The inclusion of zero-shot inference capabilities for identifying functional networks further underscores the model's versatility. The attention analysis provides a promising avenue for interpretability, aligning attention patterns with known neurobiological findings.

However, there are areas that could be strengthened.  While the paper mentions specific preprocessing steps, more details about the preprocessing pipeline (e.g., specific ICA parameters, motion correction thresholds) would enhance reproducibility.  Similarly, more details about the model architecture (e.g., the number of layers, hidden units, specific hyperparameters) in the main text (rather than just the supplementary materials) are necessary.  A more in-depth discussion of the computational resources required for training BrainLM would also be valuable.  Additionally,  a discussion of the limitations of the attention-based interpretability is warranted;  attention mechanisms, while useful, do not offer a complete explanation of the model's internal workings.

The comparison to baseline models is appropriate, but a more thorough comparison with the most recent and relevant state-of-the-art methods in fMRI analysis would strengthen the claims of superiority.  Furthermore,  the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential biases present in the datasets used (UK Biobank and HCP) and their impact on the model's performance and generalization.

Despite these minor shortcomings, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of computational neuroscience.  The development of BrainLM and its demonstrated capabilities represent a crucial step toward unlocking the potential of large-scale fMRI datasets. The availability of pretrained models via Hugging Face is highly commendable and will facilitate wider adoption and further research.  The work is well-written, clearly structured, and presents a convincing argument for the utility of foundation models in fMRI analysis.  Overall, this is a strong paper deserving of acceptance.
