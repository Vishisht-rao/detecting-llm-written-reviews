OUTPUT:
This manuscript explores the key problem of optimizing complex performance metrics in multi-label classification, particularly focusing on macro-at-k metrics under the population utility framework.  The authors rightly highlight the challenge posed by the at-k constraint, which couples otherwise independent binary classification tasks.  The theoretical contributions are significant, proving the existence and form of the optimal classifier for a broad class of metrics, including those that are non-linear functions of label-wise confusion matrices.  The derivation of the optimal classifier as a top-k selection based on an affine transformation of marginal label probabilities is elegant and provides valuable insight.

The proposed Frank-Wolfe algorithm offers a practical and statistically consistent approach to learning this optimal classifier.  The authors provide a thorough analysis of its consistency, addressing the challenges related to empirical estimation and the VC-dimension of the classifier class. The inclusion of this theoretical analysis strengthens the paper considerably.

The empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on several benchmark datasets, showing competitive performance in terms of macro-at-k metrics.  The comparison with various baselines provides valuable context and helps to establish the practical relevance of the approach.  While the algorithm sometimes underperforms on datasets with extremely imbalanced label distributions, this is acknowledged and discussed, demonstrating a realistic understanding of the method's limitations.

The paper is well-written and clearly structured, making the complex theoretical concepts accessible to a wider audience.  The supplementary material appears to contain additional details and experimental results, further enriching the contribution.  However, minor improvements could be made.  A more detailed discussion of the computational complexity of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm in relation to the size of the datasets would be beneficial.  Additionally, exploring alternative optimization methods or modifications to the Frank-Wolfe algorithm to further enhance its performance on extremely imbalanced datasets could be valuable future work.  Overall, this is a strong paper with significant theoretical and practical contributions to the field of multi-label classification.  I recommend acceptance.
