OUTPUT:
The paper focuses on a critical aspect of modular neural networks: the dynamic and adaptive composition of specialist modules for improved generalization and few-shot learning.  The proposed Scalable Modular Network (SMN) framework addresses limitations of existing methods by introducing an agreement router that iteratively refines module selection based on both local and global interactions between inputs and module outputs.  This iterative message-passing approach, detailed in Algorithm 1, is the core contribution and is convincingly argued to lead to sparse module selection, avoiding trivial solutions.  The theoretical justification for sparse selection (Theorem 1) is a strength, although a more rigorous proof in the appendix would further enhance this aspect.

The experimental evaluation is thorough, covering both a toy min-max game and few-shot image classification tasks.  The toy problem effectively demonstrates the benefits of the agreement router and global interaction, showing significant performance improvements over other routing strategies. The few-shot image classification experiments, on standard benchmarks like miniImageNet and CUB, are more compelling, showcasing SMN's superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods. The inclusion of experiments assessing the impact of adding new modules after pre-training strongly supports the "scalable" aspect of the framework.  The results regarding sample efficiency in these adaptation scenarios are particularly noteworthy.

However, several points warrant further consideration.  The relationship between the agreement routing algorithm and k-means clustering, while acknowledged, could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the key differences and advantages of the proposed method.  Clarification on the hyperparameter Î» in the combined loss function is needed, along with a discussion of its sensitivity.  Additionally, while the appendix contains further details, a more concise presentation of the modulated module design within the main body would be beneficial for readers.

The paper's clarity is generally good, with well-structured sections and illustrative figures.  The code availability is a significant positive.  Overall, the paper presents a novel and promising modular network framework with strong empirical evidence supporting its effectiveness. While minor improvements to the theoretical and descriptive aspects could strengthen the paper, its current form makes a valuable contribution to the field.  The results, particularly in few-shot learning, are compelling and warrant acceptance to the conference.
