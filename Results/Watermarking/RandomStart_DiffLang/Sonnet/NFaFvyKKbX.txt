OUTPUT:
The manuscript investigates the key problem of quantifying nonlinearity propagation in deep neural networks (DNNs), a crucial aspect often overlooked in the pursuit of improved DNN optimization.  The authors propose a novel affinity score, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, to address this gap.  This approach offers a theoretically sound method for measuring the nonlinearity of transformations, with the attractive property of identifying affine transformations uniquely.

The paper's strength lies in its comprehensive analysis of a wide range of DNN architectures, from classic AlexNet to modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).  The application of the affinity score across these diverse architectures provides valuable insights into how nonlinearity propagates and varies with architectural choices and the evolution of DNN design.  The experimental results, including the visualization of non-linearity signatures, are compelling and support the paper's central claim. The inclusion of a comparison against other nonlinearity metrics demonstrates the unique contribution of the affinity score.  The discussion of computational considerations and the use of shrinkage techniques to handle high-dimensional data is also appreciated.

However, some aspects could be improved. The theoretical justification, while present, could be further strengthened.  A more detailed discussion of the limitations of the affinity score, particularly in handling specific types of nonlinearities or extremely high-dimensional data, would enhance the paper's robustness. The relationship between the affinity score and actual DNN performance is explored, but a deeper investigation into the causal relationship, rather than mere correlation, would be beneficial.  While the authors compare to related work, a more explicit discussion of how their approach differs from existing methods in terms of both theoretical foundations and practical applicability would be helpful.

Specifically, the claim of being the "first theoretically sound solution" requires a more thorough comparison to existing literature on measuring nonlinearity in DNNs.  The brief mention of Philipp (2021) seems insufficient for such a strong claim; a more detailed critique of this and other potentially relevant approaches is needed.  The paper also relies heavily on pre-trained models; while this is a reasonable approach, exploring the behavior of the affinity score during the training process could offer further insights.

In summary, this paper presents a significant contribution to the understanding of DNNs. The proposed affinity score provides a novel and theoretically justified approach for quantifying nonlinearity propagation. The extensive empirical evaluation across various architectures convincingly demonstrates the practical utility of the method. However, strengthening the theoretical justification, addressing the limitations more thoroughly, and deepening the analysis of the relationship between the affinity score and DNN performance would further enhance the paper's impact.  Despite these suggestions, the paper is well-written, presents clear results, and makes a valuable contribution to the field.
