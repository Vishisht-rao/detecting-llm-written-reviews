OUTPUT:
This study examines the problem of backdoor attacks in federated learning and proposes a novel mitigation method using contrastive loss.  The paper is well-structured and presents a clear motivation for addressing this important security concern. The proposed method offers a compelling alternative to existing reverse engineering techniques, particularly in the context of federated learning where those techniques often struggle.

The authors convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures, comparing it against established defense mechanisms. The results highlight the superior speed and accuracy of the contrastive loss-based method, especially in detecting backdoors in federated settings. The visualizations of the reverse-engineered triggers are helpful in understanding the method's operation.  The detailed description of the loss function, including its components and their rationale, is appreciated.

However, there are some areas for improvement.  The paper could benefit from a more rigorous discussion of the hyperparameter selection process.  While the appendix mentions trial and error, providing more detail on the hyperparameter search space and justification for the chosen values would strengthen the claims.  Additionally, a deeper analysis of the limitations of the method, particularly regarding the robustness against different types of attacks or variations in trigger design, would be beneficial.  While the paper mentions limitations, a more detailed exploration is warranted.

The threat model is reasonably stated but could be expanded.  Exploring variations in the attacker’s capabilities (e.g., access to more data, different attack strategies) and their impact on the proposed method would provide valuable insights. The assumption of a readily available clean model warrants further discussion, considering the potential challenges in obtaining such a model in real-world scenarios.

Finally, while the related work section adequately covers existing defense methods and contrastive learning, further discussion on the connections between contrastive learning and backdoor detection could enrich the paper.  Specifically, a clearer explanation of why contrastive learning is particularly suited to this task, beyond the empirical results, would strengthen the contribution.

Despite these minor shortcomings, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field by proposing a novel and efficient method for mitigating backdoor attacks in federated learning. The experimental results are strong and well-presented, supporting the claims made by the authors.  With minor revisions addressing the aforementioned points, the paper would be suitable for publication at ICLR 2024.
