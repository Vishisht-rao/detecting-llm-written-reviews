OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the context window limitation in LLMs by proposing MemWalker, an interactive reading method.  The core idea is to transform long texts into a tree structure of summary nodes, allowing the LLM to navigate this tree iteratively, focusing on relevant information based on the query.  This contrasts with existing approaches that attempt to directly extend context windows or use recurrence.

The paper is well-structured and clearly explains the MemWalker methodology. The two-stage process (memory tree construction and navigation) is described in detail, including the use of iterative prompting and working memory.  The use of illustrative figures is helpful in understanding the approach.

The experimental setup is robust, using three established datasets from the SCROLLS benchmark and comparing MemWalker to various baselines including recurrence, retrieval, and methods employing larger context windows.  The evaluation metrics (accuracy) are clearly stated.  The results demonstrate that MemWalker significantly outperforms baselines, particularly on longer sequences, showcasing its effectiveness in overcoming context limitations.  The analysis of the impact of reasoning capability and working memory provides valuable insights into the method's mechanics.

The ablation study examining the impact of the reasoning justification component and working memory is particularly compelling, demonstrating their contribution to the overall performance. The authors also acknowledge limitations, including scalability issues for extremely long sequences and the dependency on high-reasoning capability LLMs.

However, several aspects could be strengthened.  The paper mentions that MemWalker highlights reasoning steps and pinpoints relevant text segments, enhancing explainability.  A more detailed analysis and examples of these explanations would strengthen this claim.  Furthermore, a more in-depth discussion on the choice of hyperparameters (segment size, maximum number of nodes) and their impact on performance would be beneficial.  While the paper explores some trade-offs in the memory tree construction, further analysis of these could provide additional insights.  Finally, a comparative analysis against other recently proposed long-context methods, beyond those explicitly mentioned in the related work, would further solidify its position within the state-of-the-art.

Overall, this is a strong paper presenting a novel and promising approach to long-text understanding.  The proposed MemWalker method demonstrates effectiveness and opens up interesting avenues for future research. The limitations are acknowledged, and suggestions for future work are provided.  With minor improvements addressing the points mentioned above, this paper would be suitable for acceptance at ICLR 2024.
