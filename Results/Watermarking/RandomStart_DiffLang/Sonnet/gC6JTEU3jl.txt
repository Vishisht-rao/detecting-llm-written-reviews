OUTPUT:
This paper presents BESA, a novel blockwise parameter-efficient sparsity allocation technique for pruning large language models (LLMs).  The authors address the limitations of existing layer-wise pruning methods like SparseGPT and Wanda, which suffer from accumulating pruning errors and require meticulous hyperparameter tuning. BESA tackles these issues by minimizing block-wise reconstruction error and learning layer-specific sparsity in a differentiable manner using learnable binary masks.  The parameter-efficient sparsity learning algorithm uses a small number of additional parameters to guide the pruning process, making it scalable to very large LLMs.

The paper is well-written and clearly explains the proposed method.  The motivation is strong, highlighting the need for efficient LLM compression. The use of block-wise pruning is a significant contribution, as it addresses the error accumulation problem inherent in layer-wise methods. The differentiable sparsity allocation is another key innovation, enabling efficient optimization of pruning rates.  The combination with quantization further enhances the compression ratio.

The experimental results are comprehensive, evaluating BESA on various LLM sizes (LLaMA 7B to 70B) and benchmark datasets (WikiText2, C4, PTB, and several zero-shot tasks). The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to SparseGPT and Wanda, showing consistent improvements in perplexity and zero-shot accuracy. The inclusion of speedup simulations using the ViTCoD accelerator provides valuable insights into the practical benefits of BESA.

However, several points could be strengthened.  The paper mentions using Wanda's importance metric for weight sorting but doesn't explore alternative metrics extensively. A more thorough comparison with other pruning strategies beyond SparseGPT and Wanda would enhance the paper's impact. While the parameter efficiency is highlighted, a more detailed analysis of the overhead introduced by the learnable parameters (beyond the percentage figures provided) would be beneficial.  The ablation studies are helpful, but additional ablation experiments, particularly focusing on the effect of different values of Î» (the hyperparameter in the loss function) could provide a deeper understanding of the method's sensitivity to hyperparameters.

Overall, this is a strong paper that presents a significant contribution to the field of LLM compression. The proposed BESA method is novel, well-motivated, and effectively addresses existing limitations.  The experimental results are compelling, demonstrating the effectiveness of BESA. With some minor improvements addressing the points mentioned above, this paper would be suitable for publication at ICLR 2024.
