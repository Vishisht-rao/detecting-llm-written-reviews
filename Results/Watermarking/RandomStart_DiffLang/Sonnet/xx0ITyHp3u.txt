OUTPUT:
This manuscript explores the key problem of combining the benefits of model sparsity and model averaging for improved neural network performance.  The authors address the challenge of maintaining sparsity when averaging multiple sparse models, which typically leads to a loss of sparsity due to differing connectivity patterns.  Their proposed method, Sparse Model Soups (SMS), tackles this by strategically retraining multiple copies of a pruned model with varied hyperparameters, ensuring they share the same sparsity pattern.  Averaging these retrained models then preserves sparsity while improving generalization and out-of-distribution performance.

The paper presents a compelling argument, supported by a comprehensive set of experiments across various architectures and datasets.  The authors convincingly demonstrate that SMS significantly outperforms standard iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) and its extended variants, achieving comparable accuracy with reduced training time thanks to parallelization.  The observation that retraining from a previously averaged model further enhances performance is particularly insightful and contributes to the method's effectiveness.

The extension of SMS to state-of-the-art pruning-during-training methods is a valuable contribution, showcasing its versatility and broad applicability. The inclusion of ablation studies further strengthens the paper by isolating the impact of individual hyperparameters.  The discussion of the relationship between model connectivity, randomness, and the effectiveness of averaging is also well-considered and contributes to a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

However, a few points could be improved.  The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of SMS, particularly in comparison to other ensemble methods.  While the authors mention parallelization, a quantitative analysis of the speedup achieved would strengthen this aspect.  Furthermore, while the paper explores different model averaging techniques (UniformSoup and GreedySoup), a more in-depth comparison of their performance and a justification for choosing one over the other would be helpful.  Finally, a more thorough discussion of the limitations of SMS, such as the potential performance degradation at extremely high sparsity levels, would enhance the paper's completeness.

Despite these minor suggestions, the paper is well-written, clearly structured, and presents a significant contribution to the field of neural network compression.  The proposed SMS method is novel, effective, and has the potential to significantly impact the development of efficient and robust deep learning models.  I recommend acceptance.
