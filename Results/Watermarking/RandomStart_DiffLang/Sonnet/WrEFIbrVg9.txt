OUTPUT:
The document focuses on a critical problem in private machine learning: the convergence analysis of differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) algorithms, especially in the challenging scenario of user-specified differential privacy budgets.  The authors present a comprehensive non-asymptotic analysis of DP-SGD and its Polyak-Ruppert averaging variant (LDP-ASGD), considering both strongly convex and non-strongly convex loss functions.  This is a significant contribution, as theoretical guarantees for DP-SGD under these conditions, particularly with varying individual privacy budgets, have been lacking.

The paper's strengths lie in its rigorous mathematical derivations and its clear presentation of theoretical results. The theorems provide insightful upper bounds on the expected distance to the optimum (for strongly convex functions) and the expected excess loss (for non-strongly convex functions), revealing the influence of key hyperparameters such as step size, dimensionality, and privacy budgets.  The authors correctly highlight the importance of the Polyak-Ruppert averaging technique and its impact on convergence rates.  The extensive numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings, showing the impact of different privacy budgets and step size decay rates. The inclusion of both linear and logistic regression examples adds to the practical relevance.

However, there are areas that could be improved.  While the paper mentions the limitations of focusing only on differentiable loss functions and fixed parameter dimensions, a more detailed discussion of these limitations and potential future research directions would strengthen the conclusions. The notation in some of the theorems is quite dense, which may present a readability challenge to some readers.  Clarifying or simplifying this notation, perhaps through supplementary material, would be beneficial.  Finally, a more in-depth comparison with existing work on differentially private optimization, including a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach compared to other methods, would strengthen the paper's contribution.

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes significant contributions to the field of differentially private machine learning. The theoretical analysis is rigorous and well-supported by empirical evidence.  Addressing the minor suggestions above would further enhance the clarity and impact of the work.  The paper is suitable for publication at ICLR 2024.
