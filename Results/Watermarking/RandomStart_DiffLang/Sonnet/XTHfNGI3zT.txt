OUTPUT:
This paper introduces PECORE, a novel interpretability framework for quantifying context reliance in language models, specifically focusing on neural machine translation (NMT).  The authors address a significant gap in current plausibility evaluations, which often rely on limited artificial benchmarks.  PECORE's two-step approach, context-sensitive token identification (CTI) and contextual cues imputation (CCI), offers a more comprehensive and data-driven assessment.

The methodology is well-defined, leveraging contrastive methods to identify contextually influenced tokens and attribute them to specific contextual cues.  The use of contrastive metrics and attribution methods is a strength, allowing for a nuanced analysis of context usage.  The authors' choice to avoid reference translations in their evaluation is commendable, addressing potential issues of distributional shifts.

The experimental setup, while relying on a relatively small number of annotated datasets (SCAT+, DISCEVAL-MT), provides a controlled environment to evaluate PECORE's components.  The comparison of different metrics and attribution methods is thorough, revealing valuable insights into their relative strengths and weaknesses. The authors acknowledge limitations in the data and propose their framework as a means to mitigate the selection bias associated with handcrafted benchmarks.  The subsequent application of PECORE to unannotated Flores-101 data provides compelling examples of both plausible and implausible context usage, demonstrating the framework's practical utility.

However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the chosen datasets. The reliance on limited discourse phenomena might restrict the generalizability of the findings.  Further exploration of different model architectures and tasks beyond NMT, while hinted at, would strengthen the paper's overall contribution.  A more in-depth comparison with existing context-aware NMT evaluation methods would be beneficial.  Finally, providing more quantitative details regarding the performance of PECORE in the unannotated settings could further support the claims about its effectiveness.

Despite these minor shortcomings, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of NLP interpretability. PECORE offers a promising approach for evaluating context usage in language models, moving beyond simplistic benchmarks towards a more realistic and comprehensive assessment. The detailed methodology and insightful analysis make this a valuable contribution to the ICLR 2024 conference.
