Review of Pairwise Proximal Policy Optimization: Harnessing Relative Feedback for LLM Alignment

This paper addresses a critical challenge in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences: the limitations of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) when used with reward models trained from comparative feedback.  The authors convincingly argue that PPO's sensitivity to reward scaling and its token-wise update mechanism introduce unnecessary complexity and instability.

The core contribution is Pairwise Proximal Policy Optimization (P3O), a trajectory-wise algorithm operating directly on comparative rewards.  The theoretical analysis demonstrating P3O's invariance to equivalent reward functions, a property lacking in PPO, is a significant strength.  This theoretical advantage translates into empirical improvements, as shown by the KL-Reward trade-off and GPT-4 evaluations on summarization and question-answering tasks.  The paper clearly presents two variants of P3O, differentiating their clipping mechanisms.

The related work section is comprehensive, effectively situating P3O within the broader landscape of LLM alignment techniques.  The discussion of the relationship between P3O, PPO, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is particularly insightful, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.  The experimental setup is well-described, allowing for reproducibility. The use of GPT-4 for evaluation adds credence to the results, though acknowledging the limitations of relying on a proxy for human judgment would be beneficial.

However, several points could be improved. While the theoretical analysis is strong, the intuition behind the algorithm could be further strengthened with clearer explanations.  The paper heavily relies on the contextual bandit formulation; a discussion of the applicability and potential benefits of extending P3O to the Markov Decision Process (MDP) setting would be valuable.  Finally, a deeper analysis of the two P3O variants (clipping separately vs. jointly) is warranted, examining their relative strengths and weaknesses in various scenarios.  Further, exploring the sensitivity of P3O to different hyperparameter settings would bolster the robustness of the findings.

Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of LLM alignment. The proposed P3O algorithm offers a theoretically sound and empirically validated improvement over existing methods.  Addressing the minor suggested improvements would significantly enhance the impact and clarity of the work.  I recommend acceptance to ICLR 2024.
