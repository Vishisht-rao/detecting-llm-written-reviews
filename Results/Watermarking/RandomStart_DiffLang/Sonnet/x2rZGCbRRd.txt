OUTPUT:
This manuscript examines an important context in causal inference, namely the issue of post-treatment bias arising from the inclusion of variables influenced by the treatment itself.  The authors convincingly argue that ignoring or mishandling these variables leads to biased treatment effect estimates.  The paper's strength lies in its clear identification of two key scenarios causing this bias: mediation and collider post-treatment variables.  The use of causal diagrams to illustrate these scenarios is helpful and contributes to the paper's overall clarity.

The proposed PoNet framework, employing representation learning to decompose covariates, is a novel contribution.  The theoretical underpinnings, including Theorems 1 and 2, provide a solid foundation for the method, although the appendix containing the proofs needs to be carefully reviewed for completeness and rigor.  The introduction of a reconstruction module and a mutual information regularizer to enhance the separation of confounders and post-treatment variables are also innovative aspects. The choice of the Wasserstein distance for confounder balancing is appropriate given the context.

The experimental evaluation is extensive, covering synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world data, and employing a range of baseline methods. The results consistently demonstrate PoNet's superiority in estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, measured by √ϵPEHE.  The ablation study further validates the contributions of the individual components of the PoNet framework.  The real-world MIMIC-III experiment adds significant weight to the findings, although a more detailed description of the data preprocessing steps would enhance reproducibility. The visualization of factor distributions using t-SNE offers compelling evidence that PoNet successfully distinguishes between the different underlying factor types.

However, some aspects require clarification or improvement:

The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the hyperparameter tuning process for PoNet.  The impact of different hyperparameter choices on the model's performance needs to be addressed.  Similarly, a more in-depth analysis of the computational complexity and scalability of PoNet would be beneficial.

While the paper mentions the linear structural causal model, exploring alternative causal models and their compatibility with PoNet would strengthen the generalizability claims. The assumption of marginal independence between U and T should be further discussed in relation to real-world applicability.

The writing style could be improved in certain sections.  Some parts are overly dense and could benefit from a more concise presentation.

Despite these minor shortcomings, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of causal inference.  The clear identification of the post-treatment bias problem, the innovative PoNet framework, and the strong empirical results make this a valuable and impactful contribution.  I recommend acceptance after addressing the points mentioned above, particularly those relating to the theoretical proofs and the hyperparameter sensitivity analysis.
