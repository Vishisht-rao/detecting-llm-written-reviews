OUTPUT:
This study examines an important problem in reinforcement learning: the inefficiency of backpropagation through time (BPTT) for training stateful policies.  The authors propose a novel approach, Stochastic Stateful Policy Gradient (S2PG), which decomposes the stateful policy into a stochastic internal state kernel and a stateless policy. This decomposition allows for a gradient computation that avoids the sequential nature and potential gradient issues of BPTT.

The paper presents a clear theoretical foundation, deriving several versions of the stateful policy gradient theorem and providing a variance analysis comparing S2PG and BPTT.  The theoretical analysis, while based on assumptions, offers valuable insights into the behavior of both estimators under different conditions, particularly highlighting the potential for exploding variance in BPTT with long sequences.  The introduction of new bounds on the variance for both methods is a significant contribution.

The experimental evaluation is thorough, covering a diverse range of tasks including continuous control problems within partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), imitation learning tasks, and a novel application demonstrating the use of S2PG to train policies incorporating trainable ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The inclusion of both reinforcement learning and imitation learning algorithms demonstrates the broader applicability of the proposed method.  The comparison with BPTT, using different truncation lengths, and with stateless baselines, including approaches using observation windows and a specialized POMDP algorithm (SLAC), provides a comprehensive evaluation.  However, the relative performance of S2PG varies across different task types and the explanation given for these differences, while reasonable, could benefit from further investigation.

The paper is well-written and clearly structured. The figures and supplementary materials further enhance understanding.  The code availability is a positive aspect, facilitating reproducibility.

While the paper convincingly demonstrates the computational benefits of S2PG over BPTT in several scenarios, a few minor limitations remain. The variance analysis relies on certain assumptions.  The comparative performance of S2PG against BPTT isn't consistently superior across all tasks, suggesting potential areas for future work. The handling of the partially observable setting with bootstrapping methods is limited to scenarios with privileged information.

Overall, this paper makes a solid contribution to the field of reinforcement learning. The proposed S2PG method offers a promising alternative to BPTT, particularly for complex tasks where the computational cost of BPTT becomes prohibitive.  The theoretical analysis and empirical results provide strong support for the claims. The paper is well-written, thorough, and presents a significant advancement in training stateful policies efficiently.  Addressing the limitations mentioned could further strengthen the paper's impact.
