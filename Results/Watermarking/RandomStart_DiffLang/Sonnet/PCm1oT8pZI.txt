OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the important problem of watermarking deep neural networks to protect intellectual property, focusing on the challenging scenario where training data is unavailable.  The proposed method cleverly leverages the representational power of a single out-of-distribution (OoD) image to inject a robust backdoor watermark. This approach offers significant advantages in terms of efficiency and safety, bypassing the need for access to sensitive training data.

The authors convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets and against various watermark removal attacks including fine-tuning, pruning, and model extraction.  The results highlight the robustness of the watermark even under these adversarial conditions.  The introduction of weight perturbation during watermark injection is a key contribution, enhancing the resilience against attacks that aim to subtly modify model parameters.

The paper is well-written and clearly structured. The methodology is described in sufficient detail, allowing for reproducibility. The experimental evaluation is thorough and rigorously assesses the proposed method's performance.  The qualitative analysis, including the visualization of weight distributions and the exploration of different OoD images, provides valuable insights.

However, a few points could be strengthened:

* While the paper claims "safe" watermarking, a more in-depth discussion of the potential vulnerabilities related to the selection and handling of the OoD image would be beneficial.  What are the implications if the OoD image is compromised or guessed?

*  The robustness against more sophisticated watermark removal attacks should be explored.  While the chosen attacks are representative, examining attacks that incorporate more advanced techniques could further validate the robustness claims.

*  A comparison with other data-free watermarking techniques would be valuable to provide a stronger context for the method's novelty and performance.

*  The paper could benefit from a broader discussion of the practical implications and limitations.  For example, how easily can the watermark be detected in a real-world scenario where the attacker may have access to some side information?  What is the computational overhead of watermark injection and verification?

Despite these minor suggestions, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of deep learning watermarking. The proposed method is novel, efficient, and robust, offering a practical solution for protecting intellectual property in scenarios where access to training data is restricted.  The paper is well-suited for publication at ICLR 2024.
