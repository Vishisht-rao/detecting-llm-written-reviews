OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the important problem of fairness in machine learning classification.  The authors propose a novel approach using empirical likelihood (EL) to construct confidence regions for the covariance between sensitive attributes and the classifier's decision boundary. This is a significant contribution because it directly addresses the uncertainty inherent in sample-based fairness assessments, a weakness of many existing methods.  The use of EL is particularly appealing due to its non-parametric nature, avoiding strong distributional assumptions.

The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a thorough review of related work highlighting the limitations of existing approaches. The theoretical results, culminating in Theorem 3.1, are rigorously presented. The simulation studies provide convincing evidence that the EL-based confidence regions accurately control the Type I error rate and effectively balance accuracy and fairness.  The real-world data analysis further demonstrates the robustness of the method to distribution shifts and its ability to handle multiple sensitive attributes simultaneously.  The use of the significance level alpha as a tunable parameter to control the fairness-accuracy trade-off is a practical and intuitive approach.

However, some aspects could be improved.  The assumptions (C1-C4) for Theorem 3.1 are stated without detailed discussion of their implications or practical verifiability.  A more detailed explanation of these conditions, perhaps with examples of when they might not hold, would strengthen the theoretical foundation.  Additionally, while the paper compares the proposed method with one existing approach, a more comprehensive comparison with a wider range of state-of-the-art fairness-aware classification methods would enhance the evaluation.  Finally, a deeper exploration of the computational cost of the proposed method, especially for high-dimensional data, would be beneficial.

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes a valuable contribution to the field of fair machine learning.  The proposed EL-based framework for fairness assessment and constraint imposition is novel and promising.  Addressing the minor points mentioned above would further enhance the paper's impact.  The paper is suitable for publication at ICLR 2024.
