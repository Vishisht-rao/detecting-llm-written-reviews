Review of "Iteration and Stochastic First-Order Oracle Complexities of Stochastic Gradient Descent Using Constant and Decaying Learning Rates"

This paper investigates the iteration and stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexities of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for non-convex optimization in deep learning, focusing on the impact of batch size and learning rate.  The authors analyze SGD with constant, decaying, and step-decay learning rates, providing theoretical upper bounds for the squared norm of the full gradient.  They further analyze the iteration and SFO complexities required to achieve an epsilon-approximation.  The theoretical findings suggest that a step-decay learning rate with a small batch size can reduce SFO complexity.  This is supported by numerical experiments on ResNet-18 trained on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and MNIST datasets.  The empirical results show that SGD with a step-decay learning rate and small batch sizes outperforms other optimizers (momentum, Adam, AdamW, RMSProp) in terms of SFO complexity, particularly when considering robustness across different datasets.


Strengths:

* The paper addresses a relevant and important problem: optimizing the efficiency of SGD, a fundamental algorithm in deep learning.
* The theoretical analysis is comprehensive, covering various learning rate schemes and providing upper bounds for key performance metrics.  The derivations are clearly structured, although the appendix is quite lengthy and could be streamlined.
* The empirical evaluation is thorough, considering multiple datasets and comparing SGD with other popular optimizers. The authors provide a link to their code, which is a positive contribution to reproducibility.
* The results are well-presented and clearly illustrated using figures. The comparison of different learning rates and optimizers is insightful.


Weaknesses:

* The theoretical analysis relies on several assumptions (C1-C3), which may not always hold in practice. A discussion of the limitations and potential implications of these assumptions would strengthen the paper.
* While the step-decay learning rate shows promise, the optimal choice of hyperparameters (α, η, T) for this method still requires tuning.  Further discussion on how to select these parameters effectively would be valuable.
* The paper focuses primarily on SGD.  An extension to other first-order methods or a more detailed discussion of why the findings might not generalize would strengthen the contribution.
* The numerical results primarily focus on achieving a specific test accuracy.  Analyzing other performance metrics such as training time or generalization performance would be beneficial.  The figures are somewhat difficult to interpret precisely due to the scaling.


Suggestions for Improvement:

* Provide a more concise presentation of the lengthy appendix material, focusing on the key results and relegating less essential details to supplementary material.
* Discuss the limitations of the assumptions (C1-C3) and their potential impact on the results.
* Offer a more detailed discussion of hyperparameter tuning for the step-decay learning rate.
* Extend the analysis and experiments to other first-order optimizers or provide a stronger justification for the limitations of the current scope.
* Consider adding analysis of additional performance metrics beyond just test accuracy.  A more detailed discussion of the methodology used to determine the hyperparameters for the optimizers would improve the quality of the experimental section.  Clearly label the axes in the figures and use a consistent scale to improve clarity.


Overall Assessment:

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the understanding of SGD's complexity. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the experimental results are compelling.  However, addressing the weaknesses mentioned above, particularly clarifying the assumptions and extending the analysis beyond SGD, would significantly enhance the paper's impact and strengthen its conclusions.  With minor revisions, this paper would be suitable for publication at ICLR 2024.
