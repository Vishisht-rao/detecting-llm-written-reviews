OUTPUT:
This paper introduces Optimal Multiple Transport (OMT), a generalization of optimal transport to multiple probability measures.  The authors formulate both Monge and Kantorovich versions of OMT, incorporating cycle-consistency constraints to ensure consistent mappings across all measures.  A key contribution is the ROMT-Sinkhorn algorithm, an iterative Sinkhorn-based method that solves a regularized version of OMT using entropic and cycle-consistency regularization.

The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of ROMT-Sinkhorn on two applications: visual multi-point matching and multi-model fusion.  Experimental results show competitive performance compared to baselines, particularly in terms of cycle consistency metrics introduced by the authors.  The application of OMT to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is an interesting, albeit less developed, side contribution. While the proposed TSP-OMT formulation and algorithm do not outperform established TSP solvers, they offer a novel perspective on the problem by working in probability space rather than distance space.

Strengths:

* Novel approach:  The generalization of optimal transport to multiple measures with cycle consistency is a novel and valuable contribution.
* ROMT-Sinkhorn algorithm: The proposed algorithm is well-motivated and provides an efficient approach to solving the regularized OMT problem.
* Comprehensive experiments: The experiments cover two distinct applications and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method across different datasets and baselines.
* Clear presentation: The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the formulations and algorithms.


Weaknesses:

* TSP application: While intriguing, the TSP application is underdeveloped.  The proposed algorithm does not achieve state-of-the-art results and requires further investigation.  The connection between OMT and TSP needs stronger justification.
* Hyperparameter tuning:  The introduction of additional hyperparameters (δ in ROMT-Sinkhorn and multiple δk in TSP-OMT) raises concerns about sensitivity and potential overfitting.  A more thorough analysis of hyperparameter sensitivity is needed.
* Limited theoretical analysis:  The paper primarily focuses on empirical results.  A more rigorous theoretical analysis of the properties of OMT and the convergence of ROMT-Sinkhorn would strengthen the paper.
* Cycle consistency constraint: The paper uses a soft cycle consistency constraint.  A comparison with a hard constraint (if feasible) would be beneficial to understand the trade-offs.

Overall:

This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of optimal transport. The proposed OMT framework and ROMT-Sinkhorn algorithm are well-motivated and show promise in applications involving multiple probability measures.  However, the TSP application needs further development, and a more detailed analysis of hyperparameter sensitivity and convergence properties is necessary.  Addressing these weaknesses would significantly enhance the paper's impact.  The paper is suitable for ICLR, but revisions addressing the weaknesses are needed.
