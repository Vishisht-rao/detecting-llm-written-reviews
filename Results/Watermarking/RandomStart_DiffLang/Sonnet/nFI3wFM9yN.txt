OUTPUT:
This paper addresses a significant gap in federated learning research by proposing Fed-GO-UCB, an algorithm for federated bandit optimization with generic non-linear objective functions.  The authors correctly highlight the limitations of existing federated bandit methods, which mostly restrict themselves to simplistic linear or generalized linear models.  The extension to non-linear functions, particularly using neural networks, is a valuable contribution, addressing a key limitation in practical applications.

The core technical novelty lies in the communication-efficient confidence set construction.  The approach of using a shared model (w0) for constructing confidence sets across clients is clever and effectively enables efficient aggregation of local statistics.  The theoretical analysis provides regret and communication cost bounds, demonstrating sub-linearity in the time horizon T, which is crucial for scalability.  The use of a distributed implementation of Gradient Langevin Dynamics (GLD) for optimizing w0 is also a reasonable and well-justified choice.

The paper is well-structured and clearly written.  The introduction effectively sets the stage, the methodology is described in detail, and the theoretical results are presented rigorously (though a high-level overview of the proof would be beneficial in the main body, as the full proofs are relegated to the appendix).  The experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets support the claims made, showing improved performance compared to existing baselines.

However, some points warrant further clarification or investigation:

* The assumption of a star-shaped communication network is a limitation.  While common in federated learning, exploring alternative network topologies would strengthen the work's generality.

* The computational complexity of Fed-GO-UCB, especially concerning the neural network optimization in Phase I, requires more detailed analysis.  The paper mentions a complexity dependent on the spectral gap of the GLD, but a more concrete assessment would be helpful.

*  A more in-depth discussion of the hyperparameter tuning of Fed-GO-UCB (e.g., γ, λ) would be beneficial. How sensitive is the algorithm's performance to the choice of these parameters?

* The empirical evaluation, while showing promising results, could be enriched by more extensive comparisons with other relevant baselines, and a clearer presentation of the experimental setup and parameter choices across all compared algorithms.

Overall, this paper makes a solid contribution to the field of federated bandit optimization.  The proposed algorithm, Fed-GO-UCB, addresses a crucial practical limitation by handling non-linear functions with provable communication efficiency.  Addressing the points mentioned above would further enhance the paper's impact.  The paper is recommended for acceptance, pending minor revisions.
