OUTPUT:
This paper makes significant contributions to differentially private (DP) learning by theoretically and empirically demonstrating the advantages of correlated noise over independent noise, as used in DP-SGD.  The authors provide sharp analytical bounds for the asymptotic learning utility of correlated noise, specifically for linear regression and more generally for convex functions.  This analytical characterization represents a substantial improvement over previous work which relied on computationally expensive semi-definite programs to optimize noise correlations.

The theoretical analysis is rigorous and provides clear insights into how correlated noise, particularly the anti-correlated noise proposed in -DP-FTRL, mitigates noise accumulation, especially along low-eigenvalue directions of the Hessian. This is particularly important in high-dimensional or low-rank settings, where the proposed method shows a provable exponential separation from DP-SGD. The derivation of near-optimal correlation functions in closed form is a key strength, significantly reducing the computational burden compared to prior art.

The experimental validation on image and text classification tasks confirms the theoretical findings.  The proposed -DP-FTRL algorithm matches or outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while offering significantly improved computational efficiency. The anytime property of the Toeplitz noise correlation matrix used in -DP-FTRL is also a practical advantage.

However, some aspects could be strengthened.  The assumptions made for the theoretical analysis, while not overly restrictive, could be discussed more extensively in relation to their practical implications. The impact of the single hyperparameter in -DP-FTRL needs further investigation, perhaps through a more systematic hyperparameter search across different datasets and model architectures.  A more detailed comparison with adaptive clipping strategies for DP-SGD would also be beneficial, placing the results in a broader context of existing DP optimization techniques.  Finally, while the authors mention the extension of their theory to finite T, a more in-depth discussion of these finite-time results and their implications for practical deployment would be valuable.

Overall, this is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach to improve DP learning. The combination of rigorous theoretical analysis and compelling empirical results strongly supports the conclusions.  The proposed -DP-FTRL algorithm offers a promising direction for efficient and effective DP training of large models.
