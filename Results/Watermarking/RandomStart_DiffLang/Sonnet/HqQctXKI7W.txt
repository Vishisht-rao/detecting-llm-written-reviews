OUTPUT:
This paper studies an important context:  the estimation of epistemic uncertainty in large, high-performing generative diffusion models.  The proposed framework, DECU, addresses a significant challenge: applying traditional uncertainty estimation methods to these models is computationally prohibitive.  The authors cleverly circumvent this limitation by training ensembles only on a small, conditional subset of the network, achieving a substantial reduction in training time and computational cost. This is a valuable contribution in itself.

The use of Pairwise-Distance Estimators (PaiDEs) is also a strong aspect of the paper.  PaiDEs provide an efficient way to estimate mutual information in high-dimensional spaces, avoiding the computational burden of Monte Carlo methods. The choice of the Wasserstein 2 distance as the specific distance metric in the PaiDE is justified and appropriate given the zero covariance matrices in their DDIM implementation.  The theoretical justification for DECU is sound and well-explained.

The experimental evaluation on the Imagenet dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of DECU.  The results, particularly the visualizations in Figures 2, 4, 7, 8, and 9, clearly illustrate the ability of DECU to capture epistemic uncertainty, especially for under-sampled image classes.  The authors effectively show a correlation between uncertainty estimates and the number of training samples per class.  The analysis of image diversity at different branching points (Table 1 and Figure 5) provides further support for the framework's validity and offers valuable insights into the model's behavior.

However, some points require clarification or further investigation:

* The paper mentions the potential application of DECU to active learning but doesn't present any active learning experiments.  While computational constraints are acknowledged, providing some preliminary results or a concrete plan for future work in this direction would strengthen the paper.

* More details about the hyperparameter selection process would be beneficial. While Appendix A.1 references the use of hyperparameters from Rombach et al. (2022), a brief discussion of any adjustments or considerations made for the ensemble setting would improve the reproducibility and transparency of the research.

*  The paper focuses primarily on the Wasserstein distance in PaiDEs.  A comparative analysis with other distance metrics (where applicable) would offer a more comprehensive evaluation and could potentially reveal the sensitivity of the results to the chosen metric.

*  The Appendix mentions limitations, including the applicability of PaiDEs to models with known output distributions and the potential use of LoRA for ensemble creation.   Expanding upon these limitations with a more detailed discussion of their impact and potential solutions would be valuable.

Overall, the paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field. The methodology is well-motivated, the results are compelling, and the writing is generally clear and concise.  Addressing the minor points mentioned above would further enhance the paper's impact and completeness.  The paper is well-suited for ICLR 2024.
