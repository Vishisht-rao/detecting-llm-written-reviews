OUTPUT:
This manuscript examines the problem of improving the convergence and generalization of neural networks by leveraging parameter space symmetries.  The authors introduce and analyze a method called "teleportation," which involves transforming model parameters using loss-invariant transformations to find points with steeper gradients or different curvature, thereby potentially accelerating optimization and enhancing generalization.

The paper presents several key contributions.  Theoretically, it provides convergence rate guarantees for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with teleportation, showing convergence to a basin of stationary points.  The authors also draw a connection between teleportation and Newton's method, suggesting a potential for quadratic convergence in certain settings.  A condition under which a single teleportation step guarantees optimality of the entire gradient flow trajectory is also derived.

Empirically, the paper demonstrates that teleportation improves convergence speed not only for SGD but also for a range of other optimization algorithms, including momentum, AdaGrad, RMSProp, and Adam.  Furthermore, the authors explore the impact of teleportation on generalization, introducing a novel notion of minimum curvature and providing evidence of its correlation with generalization performance.  They propose a teleportation-based algorithm for improving generalization by targeting minima with specific sharpness and curvature properties.  Finally, a meta-learning approach is developed to learn optimal teleportation strategies, avoiding expensive optimization on group manifolds.

The theoretical analysis is rigorous and provides valuable insights into the mechanism behind teleportation's effectiveness.  The empirical results are convincing, showcasing the algorithm's versatility and potential across different optimizers and datasets.  The introduction of minimum curvature as a factor influencing generalization is a particularly novel and potentially impactful contribution.

However, some aspects could be strengthened.  The paper's claims about the correlation between curvature and generalization are primarily empirical.  Further theoretical investigation into this relationship would significantly enhance the paper's contribution.  The computational cost of teleportation, while addressed in the text, could be further analyzed and quantified across different problem scales.  A more detailed discussion of the limitations of the approximate symmetry used in the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) experiments is warranted.  Finally, a comparison with other methods for improving generalization, such as those focusing on flat minima, would provide additional context and perspective.

Overall, this is a well-written and significant contribution to the field of optimization and generalization in deep learning.  The theoretical analysis and empirical results are strong, and the introduction of the minimum curvature concept is promising.  Addressing the suggested points would further strengthen the manuscript.  I recommend acceptance to ICLR 2024.
