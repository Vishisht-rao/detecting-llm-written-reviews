OUTPUT:
This document explores a critical domain within the field of machine learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection.  The authors correctly highlight the limitations of existing methods, particularly the bias introduced by uncertainty-based sampling strategies.  Their proposed Diverse Outlier Sampling (DOS) method offers a compelling solution by incorporating diversity into the outlier selection process.

The paper is well-structured and clearly presents the motivation, methodology, and results. The toy example in Figure 1 effectively visualizes the core concept, and the experimental results are extensive and convincing, demonstrating DOS's superiority across various benchmarks and settings.  The ablation studies are thorough, addressing concerns about the choice of clustering algorithm, the number of clusters, and the impact of feature normalization.  The inclusion of experiments with different loss functions and varying outlier dataset sizes further strengthens the claims of the paper's robustness and generality.

The authors provide sufficient detail in their methodology, making the proposed algorithm easy to understand and replicate.  The discussion section is thoughtful, addressing potential limitations and providing further insights into the workings of DOS. The comparison to related work is comprehensive, situating the contribution within the broader landscape of OOD detection research.

However, there are a few minor points that could be improved.  The computational cost of the clustering step, although acknowledged, could be discussed in more detail.  A more quantitative analysis of the trade-off between diversity and computational cost would strengthen this aspect.  Additionally, while the paper mentions the unavailability of the original 80 Million Tiny Images dataset, a brief discussion on the potential impact of using a smaller subset (TI-300K) would enhance the analysis.  Finally, future work could explore adapting DOS to other data modalities beyond images, or investigating its applicability in online or semi-supervised learning settings.


Overall, this is a strong and well-written paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of OOD detection. The proposed DOS method is novel, effective, and readily applicable, making it a valuable contribution to the community.  I recommend acceptance to the conference.
