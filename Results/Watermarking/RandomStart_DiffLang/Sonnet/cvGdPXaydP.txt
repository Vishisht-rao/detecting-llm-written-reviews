OUTPUT:
This manuscript explores the area of motion planning for autonomous vehicles, focusing on the limitations of existing simulation environments and proposing a novel approach to improve their realism and the performance of planners. The authors identify a significant shortcoming in the nuPlan benchmark's Default-Gym, demonstrating that it fails to accurately reflect real-world driving behavior across different cities.  This is a valuable contribution, as the reliance on inaccurate simulators can lead to the development of planners that perform poorly in real-world scenarios.

The paper's strength lies in its thorough analysis of the Default-Gym's limitations. The authors provide compelling evidence, including visualizations and statistical comparisons, to support their claim that city-specific driving behaviors are not adequately captured. The proposed solution, City-Driver, a model-predictive control (MPC) based planner utilizing city-specific world models, is clearly presented and logically motivated by the identified shortcomings. The experimental results, showing a reduction in test error from 6.4% to 4.8%, are impressive and demonstrate the effectiveness of City-Driver.

However, several aspects could be strengthened.  The city classification accuracy of 96% is good but needs more detail on the robustness of the classifier to unseen data or edge cases. The reliance on the IDM, while acknowledged as a limitation, could benefit from a discussion of alternative, potentially more sophisticated, models for future work. The authors mention the possibility of optimizing at the scenario or agent level, but this should be elaborated upon, outlining concrete strategies for future development.  Finally, providing more details on the weighting scheme used for the weighted average of metrics would enhance transparency.

The paper is well-written and clearly structured, making it easy to follow the authors' line of reasoning. The inclusion of figures and tables effectively communicates the results and findings.  While the contributions are significant, further investigation into the limitations of the IDM and the scalability of the city-specific models is warranted.  Overall, this is a strong paper that makes a valuable contribution to the field of autonomous driving and deserves acceptance to ICLR 2024.
