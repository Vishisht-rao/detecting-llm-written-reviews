OUTPUT:
This manuscript examines the problem of understanding the empirical success of distributional reinforcement learning (RL) compared to expectation-based RL.  The authors focus on Categorical Distributional RL (CDRL) and propose a novel interpretation of its advantage as stemming from an implicit risk-sensitive entropy regularization effect.  This interpretation is derived through a decomposition of the CDRL objective function, employing a variant of the gross error model from robust statistics.

The paper's strength lies in its attempt to bridge the gap between the empirical performance and theoretical understanding of distributional RL. The decomposition of the return density function and the subsequent interpretation as an entropy-regularized Neural Fitted Q-Iteration are insightful. The connection drawn with MaxEnt RL, highlighting the difference between explicit and implicit entropy regularization, provides a valuable contribution to the field. The proposed Distribution-Entropy-Regularized Actor-Critic (DERAC) algorithm, interpolating between expectation-based and distributional RL, further strengthens this analysis.  The extensive experiments on Atari games and MuJoCo environments provide supporting evidence for the authors' claims regarding the importance of risk-sensitive regularization.  The ablation study on the mutual impacts of explicit and implicit entropy regularization is particularly well-designed and reveals interesting interactions.

However, the paper also has some weaknesses. The theoretical analysis heavily relies on the specific properties of CDRL, and the extent to which these findings generalize to other distributional RL algorithms remains unclear.  The authors acknowledge this limitation, but a more thorough discussion of the potential limitations and future work to address this generalization is warranted.  Some of the mathematical arguments, particularly in the proofs, could benefit from greater clarity and more detailed explanations.  Additionally, while the experiments are extensive, a more focused presentation of the key results and a more concise discussion of the implications would improve readability.  Finally, the precise definition of "risk-sensitive exploration" could be clarified further.

Overall, the paper presents a compelling and insightful analysis of distributional RL, offering a novel perspective on its success.  Despite some limitations in the generality of the theoretical results and potential improvements to clarity, the paper makes a significant contribution to our understanding of distributional RL and warrants acceptance to ICLR 2024.  Addressing the suggestions above regarding generalization and clarity will further strengthen the manuscript.
