OUTPUT:
This paper presents a valuable contribution to the theoretical understanding of Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs).  The authors tackle the crucial problem of capacity analysis for several common VSAs, including MAP-I, MAP-B, and two VSAs based on sparse binary vectors.  The novelty lies in framing the analysis through the lens of sketching algorithms and hashing-based data structures like Bloom filters, establishing connections that haven't been explicitly explored before.

The use of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma is a particularly strong aspect of the analysis for MAP-I.  The extension to handle dependent entries in the case of sequences and bundles of bindings, using McDiarmid's inequality and its variants, demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of concentration inequalities.  The analysis of MAP-B, leveraging ideas from Boolean Fourier analysis, is also commendable, though the limitations due to the non-linear bundling operator are acknowledged.  The inclusion of a novel Hopfield network variant and its analysis adds further depth to the comparative study.

The paper's organization is clear and well-structured.  The technical overview provides sufficient background, and the statements of results are concise and easy to follow.  Table 2 effectively summarizes the key findings, allowing for easy comparison across different VSAs and operations. The connections drawn to sketching theory and the novelty in analyzing Bloom filters for set intersection are significant contributions.

However, the paper could benefit from some clarifications and potential extensions.  The proof sketches in Section 3, while providing a high-level overview, lack sufficient detail for complete verification.  The appendix, though extensive, might be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the specific concentration inequalities and sketching techniques.  More intuitive explanations of the more complex proofs, perhaps with simpler illustrative examples, would enhance readability.  Moreover, while the limitations of the MAP-B analysis are acknowledged, exploring potential avenues for overcoming these limitations would strengthen the paper.  Finally, a more extensive discussion of the practical implications of the derived bounds, and their comparison to empirical observations, would enhance the overall impact.

Despite these minor drawbacks, the paper's rigorous theoretical analysis, novel connections, and comprehensive coverage of different VSAs make it a valuable contribution to the field.  The findings are significant and have the potential to guide the design and application of VSAs in various domains.  Subject to addressing the minor concerns regarding proof details and clarity, this paper is recommended for acceptance.
