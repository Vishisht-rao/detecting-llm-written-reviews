OUTPUT:
The manuscript investigates the key problem of learning equivariant representations from data where the group action is nonlinear or implicit.  The authors propose Neural Fourier Transform (NFT), a general framework that addresses this challenge by learning a latent linear action of the group without requiring explicit knowledge of how the group acts on the data.  This is a significant contribution, as most existing methods rely on strong assumptions about the data and group action.

The theoretical contributions are substantial. The equivalence between the existence of a linear equivariant feature and the existence of a group-invariant kernel is a powerful result, providing a solid foundation for the NFT framework.  The proofs of existence, uniqueness, and finite-dimensional approximation are well-structured and add considerable rigor to the approach. Theorem 4.2, on nonlinear Fourier filtering, is particularly insightful, explaining how NFT effectively selects dominant spectral information.

The experimental results are compelling and demonstrate NFT's effectiveness in diverse scenarios. The comparison between NFT and DFT on time-warped signals clearly showcases the ability of NFT to perform nonlinear spectral analysis.  The applications to image data, including rotated MNIST and novel view synthesis, highlight the practical utility and generalizability of the framework.  The authors effectively demonstrate the benefits of incorporating prior knowledge about the group in G-NFT and g-NFT.  The inclusion of multiple scenarios (U-NFT, G-NFT, g-NFT) and a variety of datasets strengthens the empirical validation.

However, some aspects could be improved.  The paper's length and density could make it challenging for some readers.  Further clarification on the assumptions and limitations of the different NFT variants would be beneficial. While the authors acknowledge the need for a dataset consisting of tuples, a more detailed discussion of the implications and potential limitations of this requirement would enhance the paper. The discussion of related work is comprehensive but could benefit from a more direct comparison with specific methods and a more precise articulation of the novelty compared to those methods.  Finally, providing more detail about the architecture choices and hyperparameter tuning process in the experiments would increase reproducibility.

Overall, this is a high-quality paper that makes significant contributions to equivariant representation learning. The theoretical foundation is rigorous, the experimental results are convincing, and the proposed NFT framework offers a promising new approach to a challenging problem.  The paper is recommended for acceptance to ICLR 2024, with minor revisions addressing the points mentioned above.
