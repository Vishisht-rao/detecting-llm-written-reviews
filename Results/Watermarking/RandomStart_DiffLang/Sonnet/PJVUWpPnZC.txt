OUTPUT:
The manuscript investigates the subject of symbolic regression (SR), focusing on the challenge of discovering complex mathematical equations from limited data.  The authors propose a novel Reinforcement Symbolic Regression Machine (RSRM) that integrates reinforcement learning (RL), genetic programming (GP), and a modulated sub-tree discovery block (MSDB).  The core idea is to combine the exploration capabilities of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with the exploitation power of Double Q-learning, further enhanced by the MSDB's ability to learn new operators and simplify expressions through symmetry detection and sub-tree analysis.

The paper provides a thorough literature review, contextualizing RSRM within existing SR methods.  The authors clearly identify the limitations of previous approaches, particularly their struggles with long and complex equations.  The proposed architecture of RSRM is well-described, with clear explanations of each module and their interactions.  The algorithmic details are presented sufficiently, enabling reproducibility.  The use of figures to illustrate the model and its workflow is effective.

The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, utilizing multiple benchmark datasets, including some challenging problems with intricate functions.  The choice of evaluation metrics (recovery rate and MSE) is appropriate for the tasks. The results consistently demonstrate RSRM's superior performance over several state-of-the-art baselines.  The ablation study effectively highlights the contribution of each module to the overall performance.  The additional experiments on generalization (CDF approximation) and parametric learning (free-falling balls) further showcase RSRM's capabilities.

However, some aspects could be improved. The MSDB, while innovative, relies on heuristically defined expression forms. A more data-driven or adaptive approach to form discovery might enhance the model's generality.  The complexity of the RSRM architecture could present challenges in terms of computational cost and parameter tuning.  A more detailed discussion of the hyperparameter settings and their impact on performance would be beneficial.  Finally, while the paper mentions potential future work, elaborating on specific research directions and challenges would strengthen the conclusion.

Overall, the manuscript presents a significant contribution to the field of symbolic regression. The proposed RSRM model demonstrates promising results and tackles a challenging problem effectively.  The paper is well-written, clearly structured, and provides sufficient details for reproduction.  Minor revisions focusing on the generalization of the MSDB and a more in-depth analysis of hyperparameters are recommended before acceptance.
