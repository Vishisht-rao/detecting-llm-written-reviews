OUTPUT:
This paper addresses the important problem of offline imitation learning (IL) without requiring a hand-crafted reward function.  The proposed method, SEABO, is a simple yet effective approach that leverages nearest neighbor search (specifically, KD-trees) to assign rewards to unlabeled transitions based on their proximity to expert demonstrations.  This unsupervised reward learning method is then combined with existing offline RL algorithms.

The paper's strength lies in its simplicity and ease of implementation.  The core idea is intuitive and easily understood, making the method readily accessible to a wider research community.  The experimental results on various D4RL datasets are impressive, demonstrating competitive performance against offline RL algorithms using ground-truth rewards and outperforming several existing reward learning and offline IL methods across many tasks.  The authors also convincingly show that SEABO performs well even when expert demonstrations only contain observations.  The computational efficiency is another notable advantage.

However, there are some points that could be improved. While the authors demonstrate robustness to the number of neighbors in the KD-tree, the sensitivity to the hyperparameters alpha and beta, particularly beta, could be further investigated. A more thorough ablation study exploring the impact of different distance metrics and nearest neighbor search algorithms beyond KD-trees, Ball-trees, and HNSW would strengthen the findings.  The performance on long-horizon, high-precision tasks like IKEA furniture assembly remains unexplored, which presents a limitation. The comparison with ILR could be more detailed, specifically addressing the theoretical differences and highlighting the different scenarios each method is best suited for.

Overall, SEABO presents a valuable contribution to the field of offline IL.  Its simplicity, effectiveness, and computational efficiency make it a strong contender for practical applications.  Addressing the aforementioned limitations in future work would further enhance the paper's impact.
