OUTPUT:
This paper addresses a significant challenge in deploying large pre-trained models (LPMs): the high computational cost and memory requirements of both fine-tuning and inference.  The authors propose LoRAPrune, a framework that combines low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with structured pruning to achieve efficient fine-tuning and inference.  The key innovation is a LoRA-guided pruning criterion that estimates the importance of pre-trained weights using only the gradients of the LoRA parameters, thus significantly reducing memory overhead compared to methods relying on the gradients of the entire pre-trained model.

The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation, methodology, and results.  The proposed LoRA-guided criterion is a novel contribution, offering a practical solution to the memory bottleneck associated with gradient-based pruning of LPMs.  The experimental results, particularly the comparison with LLM-Pruner and WANDA, strongly support the effectiveness of LoRAPrune in terms of perplexity reduction and memory savings.  The ability to prune models as large as LLaMA-65B on a single GPU is a remarkable achievement.  The ablation studies provide further evidence for the design choices made in LoRAPrune, such as the use of moving averages and the iterative pruning approach.

However, there are a few aspects that could be strengthened.  The approximation made in deriving the LoRA-guided criterion (Equation 9) warrants more detailed justification. While the intuition is clear, a more rigorous analysis of the approximation error and its impact on pruning accuracy would be beneficial.  The paper mentions the limitation of requiring fine-tuning to restore performance, but a deeper discussion of this limitation and potential strategies to mitigate it (e.g., techniques to reduce the need for a large calibration dataset) would be valuable.  Finally, while the paper demonstrates superior performance on specific tasks, a broader evaluation across a wider range of downstream tasks and model architectures would further bolster the claims of generalizability.

Despite these minor points, the paper makes a strong case for the effectiveness of LoRAPrune.  The proposed framework offers a significant advancement in the field of efficient LPM deployment, addressing a critical need for reducing computational and memory burdens.  The work is well-motivated, technically sound, and presents compelling results.  The paper is recommended for acceptance to ICLR 2024.
