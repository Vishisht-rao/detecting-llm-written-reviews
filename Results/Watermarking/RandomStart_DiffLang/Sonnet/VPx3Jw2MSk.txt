OUTPUT:
The study addresses the key problem of value underestimation in off-policy actor-critic methods, a phenomenon often overlooked in favor of addressing overestimation.  The authors convincingly argue that this underestimation, particularly prevalent in later training stages (termed "under-exploitation"), stems from the reliance on currently suboptimal actions in Bellman updates, neglecting potentially superior actions in the replay buffer.  This insightful observation is supported by compelling empirical evidence, showing a significant proportion of positive ∆(µ, π) values in later training phases across various tasks.

The proposed Blended Exploitation and Exploration (BEE) operator offers a simple yet effective solution.  By blending Bellman updates from both the current policy and a mixture of historical policies, BEE leverages past successes while maintaining exploration optimism.  The theoretical analysis, while limited to tabular MDPs, provides some grounding for the approach, demonstrating policy evaluation, improvement, and iteration properties.  The practical instantiations, BAC (model-free) and MB-BAC (model-based), consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods across a broad range of continuous control tasks, including challenging failure-prone scenarios.  The real-world robot experiments further solidify the claims, demonstrating strong performance on quadruped locomotion tasks.

The ablation studies effectively demonstrate BEE's ability to capture past successes and its impact on Q-value stability.  The hyperparameter sensitivity appears manageable, with a relatively consistent optimal range identified.  The authors address potential criticisms proactively, discussing alternative implementations and adaptive mechanisms for the key hyperparameter λ.

However, some aspects could be strengthened. The theoretical analysis should ideally extend beyond tabular MDPs to provide stronger guarantees.  A more in-depth discussion of the computational overhead compared to baselines, particularly for MB-BAC, would also be beneficial. While the paper mentions several design choices for BEE, a more comprehensive comparison of these options would strengthen the overall contribution.  Finally, a clearer articulation of the precise novelty compared to related offline RL work, which also utilizes past data for improved value function estimation, would be helpful.

Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning. The identification of value underestimation as a key problem, the elegant solution proposed with the BEE operator, and the strong empirical results across simulated and real-world environments strongly support the acceptance of this paper.  The minor weaknesses identified are not detrimental to the overall impact and can be addressed through minor revisions.
