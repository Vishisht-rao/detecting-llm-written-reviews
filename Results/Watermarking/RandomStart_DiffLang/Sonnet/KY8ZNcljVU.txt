OUTPUT:
This paper introduces NetInfoF, a framework for measuring and exploiting network usable information (NUI) in node-attributed graphs for link prediction and node classification tasks.  The authors propose a principled approach using derived node embeddings to estimate NUI without model training, followed by a model (NetInfoFact) that leverages these embeddings for task solution.  The framework's key strengths lie in its generality (handling both tasks), theoretical grounding with proven lower bounds on accuracy, and claimed scalability.

The paper presents strong empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets.  On synthetic data, NetInfoF demonstrates robustness across various graph scenarios, correctly identifying ground truth NUI, a significant advantage over compared GNN baselines.  Real-world results show NetInfoF outperforming several established GNN methods in the majority of link prediction experiments, with particularly notable wins against linear GNNs, suggesting successful mitigation of their limitations.  The scalability claim, supported by a linear runtime relationship with the number of edges, further enhances the framework's practical appeal.  The ablation study validates the importance of the proposed adjustments to node similarity, specifically the use of the optimized compatibility matrix H*.

However, several aspects require further scrutiny.  The theoretical guarantees are based on discrete random variables, while the practical implementation involves continuous embeddings. The authors address this by discretizing the embeddings, but the impact of this discretization on the theoretical bounds needs clearer justification.  The choice of k-means clustering for node classification and the selection of k (the number of clusters) could benefit from more detailed explanation and sensitivity analysis.  The selection of the number of steps in random walks (kPPR, krow, ksym) as 2 requires more justification beyond the statement that it "works sufficiently well in most cases." A more in-depth exploration of the impact of this parameter choice would strengthen the paper.  Furthermore, while the comparison to existing methods is extensive, including a discussion of limitations of the chosen baselines (e.g., the scalability limitations of subgraph GNNs) is useful but could be more thoroughly integrated into the related work section.  Finally, the paper could be strengthened by a more thorough discussion of the computational complexity, particularly regarding the time complexity of H* estimation, which, while claimed to be manageable with the proposed optimizations, is potentially significant.

Overall, NetInfoF presents a novel and promising framework.  The strong empirical results, particularly on real-world datasets, suggest significant practical utility.  However, a more detailed treatment of the theoretical connections to the practical implementation and a deeper exploration of the parameter choices would improve the rigor and clarity of the work.  The provided code repository facilitates reproducibility, which is a valuable contribution.
