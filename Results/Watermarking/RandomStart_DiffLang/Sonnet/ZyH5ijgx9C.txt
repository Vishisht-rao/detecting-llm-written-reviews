OUTPUT:
This document focuses on the key problem of efficient pretraining for large language models.  The authors propose a novel stagewise training framework called progressive subnetwork training, and a specific instantiation, Random Path Training (RAPTR), which trains random subpaths of the network in each stage.  This contrasts with existing stagewise methods like gradual stacking, which train progressively larger models.

The paper's strengths lie in its clear presentation of the proposed method, its comprehensive experimental evaluation on BERT and UL2 models, and its attempt at a theoretical justification.  The empirical results demonstrate that RAPTR achieves competitive or better pretraining loss compared to standard training and gradual stacking, often with a significant reduction in FLOPs (20-33%).  The improvements in downstream performance on UL2 are particularly noteworthy, showing gains of 1-5% on several QA and SuperGLUE tasks.  The theoretical analysis, while limited to residual networks, provides a plausible explanation for the observed stability of the training process across stage transitions.  The inclusion of ablations studying scaling mechanisms and the choice of fixed layers is commendable.

However, several weaknesses need addressing.  The theoretical analysis is limited in scope and doesn't fully explain the observed improvements in downstream performance or the reduced variance.  A more comprehensive theoretical analysis, perhaps exploring the impact of RAPTR on the model's inductive biases, would significantly strengthen the paper.  While the authors compare to gradual stacking, a more extensive comparison against other efficient pretraining techniques would be beneficial.  Further investigation into the sensitivity of RAPTR to hyperparameter choices, particularly the scheduling of path lengths, is also needed.  Finally,  clarification regarding the computational cost of sampling subnetworks at each iteration would be helpful.  While the overall FLOP reduction is reported, the overhead associated with the sampling process itself might offset some of the gains.


Overall, the paper presents an interesting and potentially valuable contribution to efficient language model pretraining.  The empirical results are strong and promising, but the theoretical analysis needs further development to provide a more complete understanding of RAPTR's effectiveness.  Addressing the weaknesses mentioned above would significantly improve the paper's impact.
