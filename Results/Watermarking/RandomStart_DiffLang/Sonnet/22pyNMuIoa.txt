OUTPUT:
This manuscript focuses on the key area of prompt optimization for large language models (LLMs).  The authors introduce PromptAgent, a novel method that frames prompt optimization as a strategic planning problem, leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to efficiently explore the vast space of possible prompts.  This approach is particularly well-suited for crafting expert-level prompts, which require deep domain knowledge and nuanced understanding of LLM behavior.

The paper is well-written and clearly presents the methodology. The use of MCTS is a significant contribution, providing a principled way to navigate the complex prompt space. The integration of error feedback and self-reflection mechanisms, inspired by human trial-and-error, further enhances the effectiveness of the approach.

The empirical results are compelling, demonstrating significant improvements over strong baselines across 12 diverse tasks spanning three domains (BIG-Bench Hard, domain-specific biomedical tasks, and general NLP tasks).  The consistent outperformance across different LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM 2) highlights the generalizability of PromptAgent.  The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the different components of the method, particularly the MCTS planning strategy.  The qualitative analysis offers a clear illustration of how PromptAgent iteratively refines prompts based on error feedback.

However, the paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion of the computational cost of PromptAgent. While the authors mention the efficiency gains compared to baselines, providing more concrete numbers on runtime and resource usage would strengthen the claims.  Additionally, the limitation discussion, while acknowledging challenges in highly specialized domains, could be expanded to include a more detailed analysis of potential biases introduced by the optimizer LLM (GPT-4) and strategies for mitigating these biases.  Further, a more in-depth comparison with other gradient-free optimization methods would be beneficial.

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of prompt engineering. The proposed method, PromptAgent, is novel, well-motivated, and empirically validated.  The paper is well-written and clearly presents the methodology and results.  Addressing the minor suggestions above would further enhance the paper's impact.  I recommend acceptance.
