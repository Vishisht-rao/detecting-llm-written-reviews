OUTPUT:
Following Johnson et al. (2021), this paper presents an important contribution to privacy estimation in federated learning (FL) by introducing a novel "one-shot" approach that can efficiently audit the privacy guarantees during model training. Here are the key strengths and limitations of the paper:

Strengths:

1. Novel Approach: The paper proposes an elegant solution to privacy estimation that requires only a single training run, making it much more practical than existing methods that require thousands of retraining iterations. This is especially valuable for FL settings where training is computationally expensive.

2. Theoretical Foundation: The authors provide rigorous theoretical analysis and proofs for their method, demonstrating that it recovers the correct privacy parameter ε in the limit of high dimensionality for the Gaussian mechanism.

3. Practical Applicability: The method is model and dataset agnostic, requiring no prior knowledge about the task or architecture. This makes it highly versatile and easy to deploy in production FL systems.

4. Empirical Validation: The paper includes comprehensive experiments on real FL benchmarks (Stackoverflow and EMNIST) demonstrating the method's effectiveness under different threat models and showing that adding canary clients has minimal impact on model utility.

Limitations:

1. Asymptotic Guarantees: While the theoretical guarantees are strong, they rely on high-dimensional asymptotics. The paper could benefit from more discussion of how the method performs in lower-dimensional settings.

2. Comparison Depth: Though the authors compare their method to CANIFE, more extensive comparisons with other baseline approaches would strengthen the evaluation.

3. Parameter Sensitivity: The impact of key parameters like the number of canary clients could be explored more thoroughly, particularly for different model sizes and architectures.

4. Privacy Lower Bounds: The paper acknowledges that their estimates are not formal privacy bounds. More discussion of scenarios where the estimates might be loose would be valuable.

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to practical privacy estimation in federated learning. The method addresses a real need in the field and is supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical validation. The limitations are mostly around expanding the analysis rather than fundamental flaws in the approach.

The paper is well-written and organized, with clear explanations of both the technical concepts and practical implications. The results appear reproducible, with code provided and detailed experimental setup descriptions.

Recommendation: Accept. The paper presents an important advance in privacy estimation for federated learning that could have significant practical impact.Following Johnson et al. (2021), this paper presents a novel approach for empirically estimating privacy loss in federated learning (FL) systems in a single training run, without requiring multiple model retraining or detailed knowledge of model architecture and training data.

Key strengths:
1. Practical Significance: The method addresses important real-world constraints in FL privacy auditing, particularly the infeasibility of retraining models multiple times and limited access to training data.

2. Theoretical Foundation: The paper provides rigorous theoretical analysis showing their method asymptotically recovers the correct privacy parameter ε for the Gaussian mechanism in high dimensions.

3. Experimental Validation: The authors demonstrate effectiveness on two standard FL benchmarks (Stackoverflow and EMNIST) and compare against existing approaches like CANIFE.

4. Efficiency: The "one-shot" approach can estimate privacy during the same training run used to fit model parameters, making it much more practical than methods requiring thousands of retraining runs.

Key limitations:
1. Assumptions: While more relaxed than previous work, the method still makes some assumptions about model dimensionality and number of clients that may not always hold in practice.

2. Scope: The theoretical guarantees are limited to the Gaussian mechanism case, though empirical results suggest broader applicability.

3. Validation: While experimental results are promising, more extensive validation across different architectures and domains would strengthen confidence in the method's generality.

4. Interpretation: The relationship between the empirical ε estimates and formal privacy guarantees could be more thoroughly explored.

Overall, this is a significant contribution that makes privacy auditing much more practical for real-world FL systems. The combination of theoretical foundations and practical considerations is particularly valuable. Future work could focus on expanding theoretical guarantees and validation across more diverse settings.

Recommendation: Accept. The paper makes an important contribution to making privacy auditing more feasible in practical FL deployments while maintaining theoretical rigor.

Impact and Significance: High. The method addresses a critical need in FL systems and could significantly impact how privacy guarantees are validated in practice.
