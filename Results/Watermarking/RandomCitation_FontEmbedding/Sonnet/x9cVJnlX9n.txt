OUTPUT:
Following Johnson et al. (2021), this paper presents a novel approach for selecting machine learning model configurations that satisfy multiple risk constraints while optimizing other performance metrics. The authors propose combining Bayesian Optimization (BO) with statistical testing in a way that focuses the search on a targeted "region of interest" in the objective space.

Key strengths:

1. Technical Innovation:
- The paper introduces a clever way to guide BO toward configurations that are both likely to pass statistical testing and optimize the unconstrained objectives
- The defined "region of interest" helps focus computational resources on the most promising areas of the configuration space

2. Theoretical Foundations:
- The approach builds on solid statistical foundations from conformal prediction literature
- Theoretical guarantees are provided for risk control through careful statistical testing

3. Empirical Validation:
- Comprehensive experiments across diverse tasks including fairness, robustness, VAE optimization, and model pruning
- Strong empirical results showing improved performance compared to baseline approaches
- Thorough ablation studies examining different components of the method

4. Practical Utility:
- The method addresses an important practical problem in deploying ML systems
- Results demonstrate significant computational savings compared to grid search approaches
- The framework is flexible and applicable to various types of constraints and objectives

Limitations/Potential Improvements:

1. Additional Baselines:
- Could compare against more recent multi-objective optimization approaches
- Additional comparison with other risk-aware optimization methods would strengthen evaluation

2. Scalability Analysis:
- Limited discussion of computational overhead of the proposed method
- Could benefit from more analysis of performance with increasing dimensionality of configuration space

3. Parameter Sensitivity:
- More discussion needed on sensitivity to key parameters like Î´' and initialization
- Guidelines for selecting these parameters in practice would be valuable

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes both theoretical and practical contributions to the important problem of risk-aware model selection. The combination of theoretical guarantees with empirical effectiveness makes it likely to have significant impact in real-world applications where controlling risks is critical.

The writing is clear and the technical development is rigorous. The experimental validation is comprehensive and well-designed. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the limitations noted above.
