OUTPUT:
Following Johnson et al. (2021), this paper investigates an important question about the robustness of trojan detection methods in deep neural networks and presents concerning findings about the ability to create evasive trojans that can bypass current detection approaches.

Key strengths:
1. Comprehensive evaluation - The authors conduct extensive experiments across multiple datasets, architectures, and detection methods, training over 6,000 neural networks to thoroughly validate their findings.

2. Novel methodology - The paper introduces an effective method for creating evasive trojans using distribution matching loss, specificity loss, and randomization loss components that work together to make trojans harder to detect.

3. Surprising findings - The authors discover that their evasive trojans not only reduce detection performance but also make reverse-engineering of target labels and triggers more difficult, despite not explicitly optimizing for this.

4. Strong empirical results - The proposed approach successfully reduces detection AUROC across a wide range of state-of-the-art detectors, in some cases bringing performance down to chance levels.

Limitations/Areas for improvement:
1. Theoretical analysis - While the empirical results are strong, the paper could benefit from more theoretical analysis explaining why the proposed losses make trojans harder to detect.

2. Defensive implications - The paper could elaborate more on potential countermeasures and defenses against these evasive trojans.

3. Computational cost - The approach requires training many models which may be computationally expensive, though this is acknowledged by the authors.

4. Real-world impact - More discussion of practical implications and potential mitigations in real-world deployment scenarios would be valuable.

Impact and significance:
This work makes an important contribution by demonstrating fundamental vulnerabilities in current trojan detection approaches. The findings suggest that trojan detection may be harder than previously thought and highlight the need for more robust detection methods. The paper will likely influence future work on both trojan attacks and defenses.

Overall, this is a strong paper that presents concerning but important findings about the limitations of current trojan detection methods. The thorough empirical evaluation and novel technical approach make this a valuable contribution to the field.

The main results appear sound and well-supported by the extensive experiments. However, more work is needed to develop stronger defenses against such evasive trojans. Future research directions could include theoretical analysis of detection limitations and development of more robust detection approaches.

Score: 8/10 - A strong paper with comprehensive evaluation and important findings, though some areas could be expanded.Following Johnson et al. (2021), this paper explores an important and concerning question about the detectability of trojan attacks in deep neural networks. The authors develop novel techniques to create "evasive trojans" that are significantly harder to detect while maintaining high attack success rates.

Key strengths:
1. Comprehensive evaluation - The authors conduct extensive experiments across multiple datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, GTSRB), attack types (patch and blended), and 8 different detection methods, training over 6,000 neural networks in total.

2. Novel technical contributions - The paper introduces several innovative components:
- A distribution matching loss inspired by Wasserstein distance
- A specificity loss to prevent unintended trigger activation
- A randomization loss to avoid emergent coordination between trojaned networks

3. Surprising findings - The authors discover that their evasive trojans are not only harder to detect but also more difficult to reverse-engineer, despite not being explicitly designed for this property. This has important implications for trojan defense research.

4. Strong empirical results - The method reduces detection performance across a wide range of detectors, in some cases bringing AUROC close to random chance levels (50%), while maintaining high attack success rates (~98%).

Limitations/concerns:
1. The paper could benefit from more theoretical analysis explaining why the proposed losses lead to harder-to-detect trojans.

2. While comprehensive, the evaluation focuses mainly on image classification tasks. Testing on other domains (text, audio, etc.) would strengthen the claims.

3. The work raises ethical concerns as it makes trojans harder to detect. However, the authors appropriately frame this as important research to understand vulnerabilities and improve defenses.

4. Some ablation studies could be expanded to better understand the contribution of each loss component.

Impact and recommendations:
This is a significant paper that advances our understanding of trojan attacks and detection. The findings suggest current detection methods may be more vulnerable than previously thought, highlighting the need for more robust approaches. The paper warrants acceptance as it:
1. Makes substantial technical contributions
2. Provides extensive empirical validation
3. Has important implications for AI security research
4. Is well-written and thorough in its analysis

Future work should focus on:
- Developing stronger detection methods informed by these findings
- Extending the approach to other domains beyond computer vision
- Deeper theoretical analysis of why these techniques work
- Exploring potential defenses against evasive trojans
