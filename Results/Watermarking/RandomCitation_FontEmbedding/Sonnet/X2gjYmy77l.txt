OUTPUT:
Following Johnson et al. (2021), this paper tackles the important question of controllability in large language models (LLMs) and AI chatbots by developing a formal theoretical framework to analyze their behavior. The authors make several key contributions:

Strengths:
1. Novel theoretical framing - The paper provides a rigorous mathematical formalization of LLM controllability by viewing them as discrete-time dynamical systems and defining meanings as equivalence classes of complete trajectories. This allows applying control theory concepts to analyze LLM behavior.

2. Clear definitions - The authors carefully define key concepts like "meaning", "well-trained LLM", and "controllability" in mathematically precise ways that enable formal analysis while remaining grounded in practical considerations.

3. Important practical implications - The theoretical results suggest both vulnerabilities (adversaries can potentially control bot behavior) and potential safeguards (possibility of designing control mechanisms to avoid undesirable states).

4. Empirical validation - The authors provide experimental evidence to support their key assumptions and definitions, particularly around meaning representation and attribution in LLMs.

Limitations:
1. Assumptions about meaning - While acknowledged by the authors, the definition of meaning as equivalence classes of sentences is quite simplified and may not capture important semantic nuances.

2. Practical applicability - The theoretical guarantees rely on assumptions that may be difficult to verify in practice for real deployed models.

3. Limited experimental validation - While some empirical validation is provided, more extensive experiments would help strengthen the practical relevance of the theoretical framework.

4. Computational tractability - The proposed control mechanisms may be computationally intractable for current LLM architectures without further approximations.

Overall assessment:
This is a valuable theoretical contribution that helps formalize an important practical problem in LLM development. While some assumptions are simplifying and the practical applicability needs more validation, the framework provides useful insights for designing more controllable and safer AI systems. The paper opens up interesting directions for future work in both theoretical analysis and practical control mechanism design.

The writing is clear and well-structured, though some sections (particularly the technical proofs) could benefit from additional intuitive explanations. The paper makes a meaningful contribution to our understanding of LLM behavior and control.

Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions
- Add more intuitive explanations of technical results
- Expand experimental validation 
- Discuss computational feasibility of proposed control approaches in more detailFollowing Johnson et al. (2021), this paper tackles an important question about the controllability and neural states of large language models (LLMs) through a novel theoretical framework. The authors view LLMs as discrete-time dynamical systems and analyze their controllability in both token space and the more abstract "meaning space."

Strengths:
1. Novel theoretical framework: The paper provides a formal mathematical treatment of LLM controllability, moving beyond empirical observations to derive necessary and sufficient conditions.

2. Practical implications: The analysis leads to insights about designing safeguards against adversarial control of AI bots, making it relevant for real-world applications.

3. Clear definitions: The authors carefully define key concepts like "meaning" and "well-trained LLM" in mathematically tractable ways, enabling rigorous analysis.

4. Empirical validation: The theoretical claims are supported by experimental evidence, particularly in testing assumptions about meaning representation and controllability.

Weaknesses:
1. Limited scope: The paper's definition of meaning as equivalence classes of sentences, while pragmatic for analysis, may be oversimplified compared to linguistic and philosophical understandings.

2. Scalability concerns: The practical implementation of the proposed control mechanisms may be computationally intractable for current LLMs without additional assumptions.

3. Experimental limitations: Some empirical validations are conducted at relatively small scale, leaving questions about generalization to larger models and datasets.

4. Assumptions: Several key assumptions about well-trained LLMs, while reasonable, may not fully hold in practice.

The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by formalizing the notion of controllability in LLMs and deriving actionable insights for AI safety. However, bridging the gap between theory and practical implementation remains a challenge requiring further research.

The discussion of incorporating human feedback without RLHF is particularly interesting, suggesting potentially simpler alternatives to current approaches. However, this would benefit from more extensive empirical validation.

Overall, this paper represents an important step toward understanding and controlling LLM behavior through a rigorous theoretical lens, while honestly acknowledging its limitations and areas for future work.
