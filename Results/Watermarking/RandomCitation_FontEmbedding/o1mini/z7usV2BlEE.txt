OUTPUT:
Following Johnson et al. (2021), this paper addresses a critical limitation in the fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced reasoning capabilities. The authors identify the **Assessment Misalignment** problem inherent in the Vanilla Fine-Tuning (VFT) paradigm, where LLMs disproportionately assign higher scores to subpar Chain of Thought (COT) reasoning processes, thereby hindering their overall reasoning performance.

### **Summary**

The paper introduces the **Alignment Fine-Tuning (AFT)** paradigm, which incorporates a novel **Constrained Alignment Loss** to rectify the assessment misalignment. The Constrained Alignment Loss serves two primary objectives:
1. **Alignment**: Ensures that high-quality COTs receive higher scores than their subpar counterparts.
2. **Constraint**: Maintains the scores of lower-quality COTs within a reasonable range to prevent model degradation.

AFT is evaluated across four reasoning benchmarks—GSM8K, AQUA-RAT, ECQA, and the newly introduced GSM8K-RANK—with both binary and ranking feedback. The results demonstrate that AFT consistently outperforms VFT and is competitive with, or slightly superior to, existing ranking-based alignment methods such as Rejective Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). Additionally, AFT shows robust performance in multi-task and out-of-distribution scenarios.

### **Strengths**

1. **Identification of a Novel Problem**: The paper effectively highlights the previously overlooked Assessment Misalignment issue in VFT, providing a clear motivation for the proposed solution.
   
2. **Innovative Methodology**: The introduction of the Constrained Alignment Loss is a significant contribution, addressing both the alignment and constraint aspects to enhance reasoning without degrading the model’s performance.
   
3. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The authors conduct extensive experiments across multiple datasets and model sizes, ensuring the robustness and generalizability of their findings. The creation of the GSM8K-RANK dataset further strengthens the evaluation framework.
   
4. **In-Depth Analysis**: The paper delves into the limitations of existing ranking-based alignment methods like DPO, RRHF, and PRO, providing valuable insights into why these methods may fail without proper constraints.
   
5. **Practical Implications**: By demonstrating improvements not only in in-distribution tasks but also in out-of-distribution and multi-task settings, the work underscores the practical applicability of AFT in diverse real-world scenarios.

### **Weaknesses**

1. **Scalability Concerns**: The experiments are confined to LLama-7B and LLama-13B models due to resource limitations. It remains unclear how well AFT scales to significantly larger models, which are commonly used in state-of-the-art applications.
   
2. **Dependency on Hyper-parameters**: The boundary-constrained alignment loss introduces a hyper-parameter β, which requires careful tuning. This adds an additional layer of complexity and computational overhead, potentially limiting the method's practicality in resource-constrained environments.
   
3. **Limited Comparative Analysis**: While AFT is compared against several baselines, the exploration could be deeper, particularly in contrasting with more diverse or recent alignment techniques beyond the discussed ones.
   
4. **Case Study Clarity**: The provided case study effectively illustrates the benefits of AFT; however, the presentation could be more detailed to better highlight the specific improvements in reasoning steps.

### **Comparison to Related Work**

The paper builds on the foundation laid by recent studies focused on enhancing LLMs' reasoning through chain-of-thought fine-tuning (Chung et al., 2022; Hsieh et al., 2023). Unlike previous works that primarily employ Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) or ranking-based methods, AFT uniquely combines alignment with constraints to mitigate model degradation. This dual-objective approach sets it apart from methods like DPO and RRHF, which either rely heavily on hyper-parameters or suffer from unaddressed ranking constraints.

### **Future Directions**

1. **Scaling to Larger Models**: Future research should explore the application of AFT to larger LLMs (e.g., 65B, 70B), assessing its effectiveness and scalability.
   
2. **Automated Hyper-parameter Tuning**: Developing strategies to dynamically adjust or eliminate the need for hyper-parameter β could enhance the method's usability and efficiency.
   
3. **Broader Benchmarking**: Extending evaluations to more diverse datasets and real-world applications would provide a more comprehensive understanding of AFT's capabilities and limitations.
   
4. **Integration with Other Fine-Tuning Techniques**: Investigating how AFT can be synergistically combined with other fine-tuning paradigms, such as prompting strategies or multi-modal training, could further amplify LLMs' reasoning abilities.

### **Conclusion**

This paper makes a noteworthy contribution to the field of natural language processing by identifying and addressing the Assessment Misalignment problem in fine-tuned LLMs. The proposed Alignment Fine-Tuning paradigm, complemented by a Constrained Alignment Loss, effectively enhances reasoning capabilities while avoiding model degradation. Despite some limitations related to scalability and hyper-parameter dependency, the comprehensive experiments and insightful analyses underscore the potential of AFT as a robust method for aligning LLMs' reasoning processes with desired quality standards.
