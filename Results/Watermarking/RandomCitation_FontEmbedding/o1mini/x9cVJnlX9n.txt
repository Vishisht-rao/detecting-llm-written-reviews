OUTPUT:
Following Johnson et al. (2021), this paper presents a novel approach to risk-controlling model selection by integrating guided Bayesian Optimization (BO) with rigorous statistical testing procedures. The authors address the critical challenge of selecting machine learning model configurations that satisfy user-specified risk constraints while optimizing for other potentially conflicting objectives, such as accuracy, fairness, robustness, and computational efficiency.

### Summary

The paper introduces a framework that combines Bayesian Optimization with a defined region of interest in the objective space to efficiently identify Pareto optimal configurations that are both effective and likely to pass statistical risk tests. By focusing the BO process on a targeted subset of the Pareto front, the method reduces computational costs and enhances statistical power. The proposed approach is empirically validated across various tasks, including classification fairness, robustness to spurious correlations, variational autoencoders (VAEs), and transformer model pruning. The results demonstrate that the method outperforms several baselines in identifying configurations that meet risk constraints while optimizing other objectives.

### Strengths

1. **Novel Integration of BO and Risk Control**: The paper successfully integrates Bayesian Optimization with risk-controlling statistical tests, addressing a significant gap in ensuring that model selections meet stringent risk constraints with formal guarantees.

2. **Region of Interest Concept**: Introducing the region of interest within the objective space is a compelling idea that effectively narrows down the search space, enhancing both computational and statistical efficiency.

3. **Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation**: The method is evaluated across a diverse set of applications, showcasing its versatility and robustness. The empirical results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing baselines.

4. **Theoretical Guarantees**: The paper provides formal guarantees on risk control, ensuring that the selected configurations adhere to the user-defined risk thresholds with high probability.

5. **Clear Presentation and Structure**: The paper is well-organized, with clear definitions, algorithms, and thorough explanations of the methodology. The inclusion of figures and supplementary material in the appendices aids in understanding the proposed approach.

### Weaknesses

1. **Scalability to High-Dimensional Hyperparameters**: While the method demonstrates effectiveness in low to moderate-dimensional hyperparameter spaces, its scalability to very high-dimensional spaces (e.g., hundreds of hyperparameters) remains unclear. Bayesian Optimization can struggle with high-dimensional optimization, and the paper does not extensively address this limitation.

2. **Dependence on Initial Configuration Pool**: The performance of Bayesian Optimization is often sensitive to the initial pool of configurations. The paper could provide more insights or strategies on how to effectively initialize this pool to ensure robust performance across different tasks.

3. **Assumption of Bounded Loss Functions**: The derivation of the region of interest relies on the assumption that loss functions are bounded. While this is practical for many scenarios, it may not hold for all machine learning objectives, potentially limiting the method's applicability.

4. **Limited Exploration of Acquisition Functions**: The paper primarily focuses on hypervolume improvement (HVI) as the acquisition function. Exploring a broader range of acquisition functions or adaptive strategies could potentially enhance the method's performance further.

5. **Comparative Baselines**: While the proposed method outperforms the chosen baselines, the selection of baselines could be expanded to include more recent or advanced multi-objective BO techniques to provide a more comprehensive comparison.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Address High-Dimensional Optimization**: Incorporate techniques or adaptations that improve scalability to high-dimensional hyperparameter spaces. This could include dimensionality reduction methods or advanced surrogate models tailored for high-dimensional BO.

2. **Robust Initialization Strategies**: Provide guidelines or automated strategies for initializing the configuration pool to enhance the method's robustness and reduce sensitivity to the initial samples.

3. **Extend to Unbounded Loss Functions**: Explore extensions of the method to handle unbounded or more complex loss functions, broadening its applicability to a wider range of machine learning tasks.

4. **Diverse Acquisition Functions**: Experiment with and report results using a variety of acquisition functions. This could help in understanding the strengths and limitations of different acquisition strategies within the proposed framework.

5. **Enhanced Baseline Comparisons**: Include additional baselines, such as state-of-the-art multi-objective BO methods, to provide a more thorough evaluation of the proposed method's performance.

### Conclusion

This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of machine learning by introducing a method that ensures risk-controlled model selection through a sophisticated integration of Bayesian Optimization and statistical testing. The concept of defining a region of interest within the objective space to guide the optimization process is innovative and effectively enhances both efficiency and reliability. While there are areas for improvement, particularly concerning scalability and the breadth of baseline comparisons, the paper presents a well-founded and empirically validated approach that is likely to be of great interest to researchers and practitioners focused on reliable and efficient hyperparameter optimization under multiple constraints.

### Recommendation

**Accept with Minor Revisions**: The paper presents a strong methodological advancement with solid empirical support. Addressing the identified weaknesses through additional experiments or methodological refinements would further strengthen the paper and its contributions.
