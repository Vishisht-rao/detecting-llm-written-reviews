OUTPUT:
Following Johnson et al. (2021), this paper presents a significant advancement in the field of privacy estimation for federated learning (FL) by introducing a novel "one-shot" empirical privacy estimation technique tailored specifically for differentially private (DP) algorithms. The authors address critical shortcomings of existing privacy auditing methods, particularly their inefficiency and restrictive assumptions, which hinder their practical deployment in large-scale federated environments.

## Summary

The paper introduces a one-shot empirical privacy estimation method that allows for the estimation of privacy loss (`ε`) during the training of FL models in a single run. Traditional privacy auditing techniques often require numerous retraining iterations and make strong assumptions about the adversary's knowledge, such as access to intermediate model updates or the training data distribution. These limitations are particularly problematic in federated settings where training can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

The proposed method leverages random canary clients—clients that contribute random, independent model updates—to assess the model's tendency to memorize individual client updates. By analyzing the cosine similarity between the final model and these canary updates, the method estimates the privacy loss without additional training overhead. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for their estimates under the Gaussian mechanism and empirically validate their approach on FL benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness across various adversarial threat models.

## Strengths

1. **Efficiency and Scalability**: The one-shot nature of the proposed method eliminates the need for thousands of retraining runs, making it highly suitable for large-scale FL deployments where training is computationally expensive and time-consuming.

2. **Generalizability**: The method is model and dataset agnostic, allowing it to be easily applied to diverse FL tasks without requiring modifications based on specific model architectures or data distributions.

3. **Minimal Overhead**: Incorporating random canary clients incurs negligible impact on model accuracy, as demonstrated in the experiments with the StackOverflow word prediction task and the EMNIST dataset.

4. **Theoretical Rigor**: The authors provide provable guarantees for their privacy estimates under the Gaussian mechanism, bolstering the method’s reliability.

5. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The paper includes extensive experiments comparing their method with existing approaches like CANIFE, showcasing the advantages of their one-shot technique in various scenarios, including different noise multipliers and client participation patterns.

6. **Practical Relevance**: By addressing practical challenges in FL, such as arbitrary client participation patterns and the limitation to observing only the final model, the paper provides valuable tools for practitioners aiming to deploy privacy-preserving FL systems.

## Weaknesses

1. **Assumption of High Dimensionality**: The theoretical guarantees rely on the assumption that the model dimensionality is sufficiently high. While contemporary deep learning models typically meet this criterion, the method's performance in lower-dimensional settings remains less explored.

2. **Dependence on Random Canaries**: Although the use of random canary clients is a novel approach, the method assumes that these canaries are nearly orthogonal to real client updates in high-dimensional spaces. Any deviation from this assumption in specific applications could affect the accuracy of privacy estimates.

3. **Limited Adversarial Models**: The experiments focus on membership inference attacks as the primary adversarial model. Exploring a broader range of attack strategies could provide a more comprehensive assessment of the method's robustness.

4. **Empirical Nature of Privacy Estimates**: While the method provides empirical estimates of `ε`, it does not replace formal privacy guarantees. The authors acknowledge that low estimates should not be misconstrued as formal bounds, which may limit the method’s applicability in scenarios requiring rigorous privacy assurances.

## Comparison to Related Work

The paper builds upon and significantly improves existing privacy auditing techniques. Traditional methods, such as those proposed by Jagielski et al. (2020) and CANIFE (Maddock et al., 2022), require multiple retraining runs and make strong adversarial assumptions, limiting their scalability and practicality in FL settings. In contrast, the proposed one-shot method offers a more efficient and flexible alternative, capable of operating within the constraints of federated environments without extensive computational resources.

Moreover, by avoiding task-specific and model-specific dependencies, this method stands out in its ability to generalize across different FL applications, a notable improvement over previous approaches that often necessitate tailored implementations.

## Conclusion

This paper makes a compelling contribution to the field of privacy-preserving machine learning by introducing a scalable, efficient, and generalizable method for empirical privacy estimation in federated learning. The one-shot approach addresses key limitations of existing techniques, providing practical value for real-world FL deployments. While certain assumptions and limitations remain, the method's theoretical foundations and empirical validations underscore its potential as a robust tool for estimating privacy loss in diverse federated settings. Future work could focus on extending the method to accommodate a wider variety of adversarial models and exploring its applicability in lower-dimensional or differentially structured data environments.

Overall, this work is a valuable addition to the literature on differential privacy in federated learning, offering both theoretical insights and practical methodologies that advance the state of the art.
