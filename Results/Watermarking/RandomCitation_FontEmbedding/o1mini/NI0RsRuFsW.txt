**Review:**

Following Johnson et al. (2021), this paper addresses the critical issue of trojan detection in deep neural networks (DNNs) by introducing a novel method to enhance the evasiveness of trojaned models. The authors present a comprehensive approach that leverages a distribution matching loss inspired by the Wasserstein distance, coupled with specificity and randomization losses, to create trojans that are significantly harder to detect by existing model-level detectors.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Originality:** The paper introduces a groundbreaking method for enhancing the evasiveness of trojans in DNNs. By focusing on model-level detection, which has been relatively underexplored compared to input-level and dataset-level defenses, the authors bridge an essential gap in the current research landscape.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The authors conduct extensive experiments, training over 6,000 trojaned neural networks across multiple datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and GTSRB) and evaluating them against eight diverse detection methods, including state-of-the-art algorithms and simple baselines. This extensive evaluation underscores the robustness and generalizability of their approach.

3. **Impactful Findings:** One of the most striking results is that the proposed evasive trojans not only reduce the efficacy of detection methods but also make reverse-engineering tasks, such as target label prediction and trigger synthesis, substantially harder. This dual-effect amplifies the significance of the findings, highlighting a heightened risk in deploying trojaned models.

4. **Technical Rigor:** The methodology is well-articulated, with clear definitions of the threat model and the components of the evasion loss. The inclusion of ablation studies and additional analyses in the appendices demonstrates the authors' thoroughness in validating their approach.

5. **Reproducibility:** The authors mention that experiment code and models are available (though anonymized for the review process), which is commendable for facilitating reproducibility and further research by the community.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Specificity of Evading Techniques:** While the paper focuses on enhancing evasion against model-level detectors, it would benefit from a deeper exploration of how these techniques might be adapted or extended to other levels of detection. This could provide a more holistic understanding of the attack's implications across the entire detection landscape.

2. **Generalization to Other Architectures:** The experiments primarily involve specific neural network architectures (e.g., Wide ResNets, SimpleViT Vision Transformer, and simple convnets for MNIST). It would be insightful to investigate whether the proposed evasion techniques maintain their efficacy across a broader spectrum of architectures, including more complex or unconventional models.

3. **Potential Mitigation Strategies:** While the paper emphasizes the urgency for developing more robust detectors, it stops short of suggesting potential mitigation strategies or avenues for defenders to counteract these enhanced evasion techniques. Providing preliminary insights or recommendations could enrich the discussion and guide future defensive research.

4. **Impact on Model Performance:** Although Table 1 indicates that the attack success rate (ASR) and task accuracy remain largely unaffected by the evasion techniques, a more nuanced analysis of potential trade-offs or hidden costs associated with embedding these evasive trojans would be valuable.

**Questions for Authors:**

1. **Choice of Distance Metrics:** The paper explores different distance metrics for distribution matching. Could the authors elaborate on how they selected the specific combination of ℓ2 distance in parameter space and ℓ1 distance in logit space? Were other metrics considered, and how might they influence the evasion performance?

2. **Limitations of the Threat Model:** The current threat model assumes that defenders have access to a dataset of clean and trojaned networks using the same trojan insertion method with random triggers and target labels. How realistic is this assumption in practical scenarios, and how might the approach fare under different threat model assumptions?

3. **Scalability and Computational Overheads:** Given the extensive training of over 6,000 neural networks, what are the computational requirements for deploying this evasion method in real-world settings? Are there optimizations or scalable strategies that could mitigate potential resource constraints?

4. **Potential for Adaptive Defenses:** How do the authors envision adaptive defense mechanisms that might arise in response to this enhanced evasion technique? Are there preliminary ideas or experiments that suggest how robust the proposed method is against evolving detection strategies?

**Conclusion and Recommendation:**

This paper makes a significant and timely contribution to the field of adversarial machine learning by unveiling the potential vulnerabilities in existing trojan detection mechanisms. The introduction of a method to create more evasive trojans not only challenges the current defensive paradigms but also propels the community towards developing more resilient detection strategies. Given the originality, technical rigor, and impactful findings, I recommend **acceptance** of this paper for presentation at ICLR 2024. Addressing the outlined weaknesses and questions in a revised version would further strengthen the manuscript and its contributions to the field.
