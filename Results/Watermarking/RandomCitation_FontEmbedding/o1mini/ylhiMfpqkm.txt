**Review Title:** Leveraging Unsupervised Pre-Training for Enhanced Adaptability in Generative Flow Networks

**Following Johnson et al. (2021), this paper** introduces a novel approach to pre-train Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) in an unsupervised, reward-free manner, thereby enhancing their adaptability to downstream tasks with different reward functions. The authors propose an Outcome-Conditioned GFlowNet (OC-GFN) that learns to reach any targeted outcome, akin to goal-conditioned policies in reinforcement learning. Additionally, they present an amortized predictor to efficiently approximate intractable marginalizations required for fine-tuning the pre-trained model to specific tasks.

**Summary of Contributions:**

1. **Unsupervised Pre-Training of GFlowNets:** The paper formulates pre-training GFlowNets as a self-supervised problem, introducing OC-GFN that can explore and reach diverse outcomes without task-specific rewards.

2. **Efficient Fine-Tuning Mechanism:** To adapt the pre-trained OC-GFN to downstream tasks, the authors propose an amortized predictor that approximates the necessary marginalizations, facilitating efficient fine-tuning.

3. **Empirical Validation:** Extensive experiments on GridWorld, bit sequence generation, TF Bind generation, RNA generation, and antimicrobial peptide (AMP) generation demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method compared to strong baselines.

4. **Theoretical Justifications:** The paper provides theoretical propositions ensuring that the OC-GFN can successfully reach any specified outcome and that the amortized predictor accurately estimates the required marginals.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Pre-Training Strategy:** Adopting unsupervised pre-training for GFlowNets is a significant advancement, drawing inspiration from successful paradigms in vision and language domains. This approach addresses the limitation of GFlowNets needing to be trained from scratch for each new reward function.

2. **Robust Fine-Tuning Mechanism:** The introduction of an amortized predictor to approximate intractable marginalizations is both novel and practical, ensuring that the fine-tuning process remains computationally feasible even in high-dimensional outcome spaces.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The authors conduct thorough experiments across various domains, including synthetic (GridWorld, bit sequences) and real-world biological tasks (TF Bind, RNA, AMP generation). This breadth showcases the versatility and scalability of the proposed method.

4. **Theoretical Rigor:** The inclusion of propositions with theoretical justifications adds depth to the work, ensuring that the proposed methods are not only empirically effective but also grounded in solid theoretical foundations.

5. **Contrastive Learning Integration:** Addressing the challenge of sparse rewards through contrastive learning and outcome teleportation demonstrates the authors' attention to practical training difficulties, enhancing the model's learning efficiency.

**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Clarity in Methodology:** While the paper is comprehensive, certain sections, especially those detailing the algorithms and the amortized predictor, could benefit from clearer explanations or additional diagrams to aid reader comprehension.

2. **Ablation Studies Scope:** Although the paper includes ablation studies, expanding these to cover more variations or alternative approaches for unsupervised pre-training could provide deeper insights into the robustness of the proposed method.

3. **Comparison with More Baselines:** Including comparisons with a broader range of generative models or other state-of-the-art methods in unsupervised learning could strengthen the empirical claims.

4. **Scalability Analysis:** While scalability is demonstrated through biological sequence tasks, a more explicit analysis of computational resources, especially in extremely high-dimensional spaces, would be beneficial.

5. **Potential Limitations Discussion:** A more detailed discussion on scenarios where the proposed method might underperform or the assumptions made (e.g., consistency in state and action spaces) could provide a balanced view of the approach's applicability.

**Questions for the Authors:**

1. **Choice of Outcome Representation:** How sensitive is the OC-GFN to the representation of outcomes? Have you experimented with alternative outcome encoding schemes, especially in continuous outcome spaces?

2. **Amortized Predictor Training Stability:** Can you provide more insights into the training stability of the amortized predictor, especially in complex tasks with vast outcome spaces?

3. **Extension to Different State and Action Spaces:** The paper mentions this as a future direction. Do you foresee any immediate challenges or modifications required to handle varying state and action spaces across tasks?

4. **Impact of Intrinsic Rewards in GAFN:** How critical is the specific choice of intrinsic reward mechanisms in the pre-training phase? Have you explored alternatives beyond random network distillation?

**Conclusion and Recommendation:**

This paper presents a significant advancement in the field of Generative Flow Networks by introducing a robust unsupervised pre-training framework that enhances adaptability and efficiency in downstream tasks. The combination of theoretical rigor, innovative methodology, and comprehensive empirical validation makes it a strong candidate for acceptance. Addressing the minor clarifications and expanding certain experimental comparisons would further solidify its impact.
