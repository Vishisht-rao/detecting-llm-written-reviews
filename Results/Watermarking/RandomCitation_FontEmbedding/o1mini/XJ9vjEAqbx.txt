OUTPUT:
Following Johnson et al. (2021), this paper presents a novel approach to adversarial training by reimagining it as a non-zero-sum game. Addressing the inherent vulnerabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs) to adversarial perturbations, the authors critically assess the prevalent two-player zero-sum paradigm and identify fundamental shortcomings that hinder the effectiveness of existing adversarial training (AT) algorithms.

**Summary of Contributions**

The paper makes several significant contributions to the field of adversarial robustness:

1. **Identification of Surrogate Loss Limitations:** The authors demonstrate that the commonly employed surrogate-based relaxations in zero-sum adversarial training fail to guarantee robustness against adversarial examples. Specifically, maximizing surrogate losses like cross-entropy does not ensure an increase in classification error, leading to weak adversarial attacks and ineffective defenses.

2. **Non-Zero-Sum Bilevel Formulation:** To overcome the limitations of the zero-sum approach, the paper introduces a bilevel optimization framework where the adversary and defender optimize distinct objectives. This non-zero-sum game ensures that the adversary directly targets the classification error, aligning more closely with the true goal of adversarial robustness.

3. **Development of BETA and BETA-AT Algorithms:** Building on the bilevel formulation, the authors propose BETA, a new adversarial attack algorithm, and BETA-AT, an adversarial training algorithm. BETA is designed to maximize the classification error effectively, while BETA-AT leverages this attack to train robust models without relying on heuristics.

4. **Empirical Validation:** Comprehensive experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset showcase that BETA-AT not only matches but in some cases surpasses state-of-the-art AT methods. Notably, BETA-AT eliminates the phenomenon of robust overfitting—a common pitfall in existing AT approaches—and achieves robustness comparable to AutoAttack with significantly reduced computational overhead.

**Strengths**

- **Theoretical Rigor:** The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation for its claims, including proofs that illustrate the misalignment between surrogate losses and true classification error in zero-sum settings. Proposition 1 and the subsequent example effectively highlight the failures of surrogate-based adversarial losses.

- **Innovative Formulation:** By decoupling the objectives of the adversary and defender, the bilevel optimization framework represents a meaningful departure from traditional approaches. This innovation addresses fundamental issues in adversarial training, paving the way for more effective robustness guarantees.

- **Practical Algorithms:** The introduction of BETA and BETA-AT offers tangible tools for practitioners. The algorithms are not only theoretically sound but also empirically validated, demonstrating practical utility in enhancing model robustness.

- **Comprehensive Experiments:** The experimental section is thorough, comparing BETA-AT against multiple baselines and state-of-the-art attacks across various metrics. The elimination of robust overfitting and the efficiency gains over AutoAttack are particularly noteworthy.

**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement**

- **Scope of Experiments:** While the CIFAR-10 dataset is a standard benchmark, extending experiments to additional datasets and more complex architectures could provide a broader validation of the proposed methods. This would help in assessing the generalizability and scalability of BETA-AT.

- **Computational Overhead:** Although BETA matches AutoAttack's robustness with reduced iterations, the paper acknowledges an increased computational overhead during training. A more detailed analysis or optimization strategies to mitigate this overhead would enhance the practical applicability of BETA-AT.

- **Comparative Analysis with Recent Methods:** The adversarial robustness landscape is rapidly evolving. Including comparisons with the latest adversarial training techniques beyond those cited would position the work more firmly within the current state-of-the-art.

- **Theoretical Guarantees:** While the bilevel formulation is compelling, providing additional theoretical guarantees regarding convergence properties and robustness bounds would strengthen the paper's contributions.

**Relation to Related Work**

The paper situates itself within the broader discourse on adversarial training by critiquing the reliance on surrogate losses in zero-sum frameworks. It distinguishes itself from prior works such as TRADES and MART by opting for a non-zero-sum approach, thereby addressing issues like robust overfitting at their core. Additionally, the comparison with bilevel formulations in recent literature, such as Zhang et al. (2022) and Mianjy & Arora (2024), highlights the distinctiveness of the authors' approach in handling adversarial robustness.

**Suggestions for Future Work**

- **Extension to Diverse Architectures and Tasks:** Investigating the efficacy of BETA-AT on a variety of neural network architectures and across different tasks (e.g., natural language processing, reinforcement learning) would be valuable.

- **Optimization Enhancements:** Exploring advanced optimization techniques within the bilevel framework could help reduce the computational costs associated with BETA-AT, making it more accessible for large-scale applications.

- **Robustness Against Diverse Threat Models:** Evaluating BETA-AT's robustness against a wider array of adversarial attacks, including those beyond ℓ∞ perturbations, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of its effectiveness.

- **Theoretical Extensions:** Developing deeper theoretical insights into the convergence and robustness guarantees of the bilevel non-zero-sum approach could further validate and refine the proposed methods.

**Conclusion**

This paper offers a meaningful advancement in the quest for robust deep learning models by challenging the traditional zero-sum adversarial training paradigm and introducing a theoretically grounded non-zero-sum bilevel formulation. The proposed BETA and BETA-AT algorithms not only address key limitations of existing methods but also demonstrate promising empirical performance. While there are areas for further exploration and optimization, the contributions presented lay a solid foundation for future research in adversarial robustness.
