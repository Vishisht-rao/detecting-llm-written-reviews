**Review of "YOUONLY LOOK AT SCREENS: MULTIMODAL CHAIN-OF-ACTION AGENTS"**

*Following Johnson et al. (2021), this paper* introduces **Auto-UI**, a novel multimodal autonomous agent designed for user interface (UI) control without the reliance on external parsing tools or application-specific APIs. The authors address critical challenges in existing approaches, notably inference inefficiency and error propagation, by enabling direct interaction with UI screens. They further enhance action prediction through a **chain-of-action** technique, which leverages both historical actions and planned future actions. The proposed method is evaluated on the **AITW benchmark**, showcasing state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements in action type prediction accuracy and overall action success rates.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach:** The introduction of Auto-UI presents a significant advancement by circumventing the need for environment parsing and API dependencies. This aligns with the growing need for more generalized and efficient autonomous agents capable of operating across diverse UI environments.

2. **Chain-of-Action Technique:** Leveraging a sequence of previous actions and future plans to inform current action decisions is a commendable strategy. This method not only enhances decision-making but also introduces a layer of reasoning that mimics human-like planning.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper presents a thorough evaluation on the AITW benchmark, covering a wide range of tasks across multiple applications and websites. The inclusion of various baselines, including In-context Learning (ICL), fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs), and specialized UI agents, provides a robust comparison framework.

4. **Empirical Results:** Achieving a 90% accuracy in action type prediction and a 74% overall action success rate demonstrates the effectiveness of Auto-UI. Additionally, the model's ability to perform action predictions in under one second underscores its practical viability.

5. **Ablation Studies:** The paper includes detailed ablation studies that validate the contributions of key components such as the chain-of-action and coordinate normalization. This strengthens the argument for the proposed methodology's efficacy.

6. **Generalization Capability:** The distinction between Auto-UI separate and unified models, along with their performance across different subsets, highlights the model's versatility and potential for real-world applications.

**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Limited Generalization to Highly Diverse UIs:** While the model performs well across the AITW benchmark, it's unclear how it would handle UIs that significantly deviate from those present in the training data. Additional experiments showcasing performance on entirely unseen or highly customized UIs would provide deeper insights into generalization capabilities.

2. **Dependence on Pre-trained Encoders:** The reliance on frozen vision encoders like BLIP-2 and language encoders like FLAN-Alpaca may limit the adaptability of Auto-UI to domains where these encoders are less effective. Exploring the integration of more adaptable or domain-specific encoders could enhance performance further.

3. **Error Analysis:** While the overall performance metrics are impressive, the paper would benefit from a more detailed error analysis. Understanding the common failure modes, especially in scenarios where Auto-UI underperforms, can guide future improvements and highlight limitations.

4. **Scalability Concerns:** Although the inference speed is commendable, scalability in terms of handling more complex tasks or longer action chains remains unexplored. Discussing potential bottlenecks and strategies to address them would add depth to the methodology section.

5. **User Instruction Complexity:** The evaluation primarily focuses on multi-step tasks within predefined instructions. Investigating how Auto-UI handles ambiguous or highly complex user instructions could provide a more comprehensive assessment of its practical utility.

**Questions for the Authors:**

1. **Handling Dynamic UIs:** How does Auto-UI manage dynamic changes in the UI, such as animations, pop-ups, or real-time content updates? Are there mechanisms in place to ensure robustness against such variations?

2. **Chain-of-Action Length:** The choice of limiting previous actions to 8 and future actions to 4 is based on analysis within the General subset. How sensitive is the model's performance to these parameters across different subsets or more extensive action chains?

3. **Training Efficiency:** Training the large and base models takes 75 and 25 hours, respectively. Are there strategies to optimize training time without compromising performance, especially for deployment in resource-constrained environments?

**Conclusion:**

"YOUONLY LOOK AT SCREENS: MULTIMODAL CHAIN-OF-ACTION AGENTS" presents a compelling approach to autonomous UI control by eliminating dependencies on external parsing tools and APIs. The introduction of the chain-of-action technique and the empirical validation on a comprehensive benchmark solidify Auto-UI's position as a state-of-the-art solution in the field. While there are areas that warrant further exploration, particularly regarding generalization and scalability, the paper makes significant contributions to the development of efficient and adaptable autonomous agents. I recommend **acceptance** with minor revisions addressing the aforementioned weaknesses and questions.
