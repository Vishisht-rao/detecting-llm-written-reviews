OUTPUT:
Following Johnson et al. (2021), this paper addresses the critical challenge of performing differentially private (DP) principal component analysis (PCA) in vertically partitioned federated learning (VFL) settings. The authors identify a significant gap in existing research, which has predominantly focused on horizontally partitioned data, and propose a novel solution named SPCA to bridge this gap. The paper is methodically structured, presenting a clear progression from problem definition to theoretical analysis and empirical validation.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Contribution:** The introduction of SPCA as the first DP algorithm tailored for VFL is a noteworthy advancement. By addressing both server-observed and client-observed DP without relying on trusted third parties, the authors significantly enhance privacy guarantees in VFL scenarios.

2. **Theoretical Robustness:** The authors provide rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that SPCA matches the privacy-utility trade-offs of centralized DP PCA. The use of random matrix theory to justify the algorithm's efficacy strengthens the paper's theoretical foundation.

3. **Comprehensive Empirical Evaluation:** Extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including KDDCUP, ACSIncome, CiteSeer, and Gene, validate the theoretical claims. The results convincingly show that SPCA outperforms existing distributed baselines and closely aligns with centralized DP solutions, underscoring its practical viability.

4. **Clarity and Organization:** The paper is well-organized, with clear definitions, logical flow, and detailed explanations of algorithms and proofs. The inclusion of algorithms and lemmas aids in understanding the proposed methods and their implications.

5. **Extension to Logistic Regression:** Beyond PCA, the authors extend their methodology to logistic regression (SLR), demonstrating the versatility of their approach. This extension broadens the paper's impact, showcasing applicability to other fundamental machine learning tasks.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Assumptions on MPC:** While the paper assumes an error-free and secure channel between clients, real-world implementations may face challenges such as network delays, synchronization issues, and potential protocol deviations. Discussing the robustness of SPCA under imperfect conditions would enhance the practical relevance of the work.

2. **Scalability Considerations:** Although the authors mention that the communication and computational overheads are manageable, a more detailed scalability analysis, especially with a growing number of clients and higher-dimensional data, would provide deeper insights into the algorithm's applicability in large-scale deployments.

3. **Comparison with Alternative DP Mechanisms:** The paper primarily compares SPCA with the centralized DP baseline and a distributed Gaussian noise baseline. Exploring comparisons with other DP mechanisms, such as the Laplace mechanism or advanced noise calibration methods, could offer a more comprehensive evaluation of SPCA's performance.

4. **Impact of Discretization Parameter γ:** While the authors suggest setting γ proportional to the data dimension to balance privacy and utility, a more thorough exploration of how different γ values affect performance across various datasets and settings would be beneficial. This could include sensitivity analyses or guidelines for selecting optimal γ in practice.

5. **Client-Observed DP Trade-offs:** The results indicate that while SPCA achieves strong server-observed DP, there is a trade-off with client-observed DP, especially as the number of clients increases. Further discussion on mitigating this trade-off or exploring mechanisms to enhance client-side privacy without compromising server-side guarantees would be valuable.

**Significance and Impact:**

This paper makes a substantial contribution to the field of privacy-preserving machine learning, particularly in the context of federated learning with vertically partitioned data. By ensuring robust differential privacy without trusting any single party, SPCA enhances the feasibility of secure collaborative data analysis in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and personalized services. The theoretical guarantees combined with empirical validations position SPCA as a promising tool for practitioners seeking to balance data utility with stringent privacy requirements.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, this paper presents a well-founded and innovative approach to differentially private PCA in vertically partitioned federated learning environments. Through its strong theoretical underpinnings and practical validations, it advances the state-of-the-art in privacy-preserving data analysis. Addressing the highlighted areas for improvement could further solidify its contributions and broaden its applicability. The work is highly relevant for the ICLR community and is poised to influence future research and applications in secure federated learning.
