OUTPUT:
This paper addresses a critical issue in adversarial training (AT): the use of surrogate losses, like cross-entropy, in place of the discontinuous 0-1 loss.  While computationally convenient, this substitution creates a gap between theoretical guarantees and practical performance, leading to weak adversaries and ineffective defenses. The authors convincingly argue that this surrogate approach results in two key limitations: 1) adversaries that maximize an upper bound on classification error, rather than the error itself, and 2) defenders who minimize a similarly misaligned objective, leading to phenomena like robust overfitting.

To address these shortcomings, the paper proposes a novel non-zero-sum bilevel formulation of AT. This formulation decouples the attacker's and defender's objectives. The attacker maximizes a continuous reformulation of the classification error based on the negative margin, while the defender minimizes an upper bound on the classification error, preserving theoretical guarantees.

This theoretical contribution leads to a new AT algorithm called BETA (Best Targeted Attack) and a corresponding training procedure, BETA-AT. Empirical evaluations on CIFAR-10 demonstrate promising results. Notably, BETA-AT matches and, in certain cases, surpasses the robustness of state-of-the-art attacks like AutoAttack, while also avoiding robust overfitting. Furthermore, BETA, as an attack, achieves comparable performance to AutoAttack but is significantly more computationally efficient.

The paper's strength lies in its clear identification of a fundamental flaw in current AT practices and its proposal of a theoretically sound solution. The empirical results, while limited to CIFAR-10, provide compelling evidence for the efficacy of the proposed approach.

However, the paper could be further strengthened by:

* **More Extensive Empirical Evaluation:** Evaluating BETA and BETA-AT on larger and more diverse datasets, like ImageNet, is crucial for establishing their generalizability.
* **Comparison with More Recent AT Methods:**  The paper focuses on standard AT algorithms. Comparing with more recent advances in AT would further contextualize the contribution.
* **Ablation Study on Hyperparameters:**  An ablation study on the temperature parameter Î¼ in the smooth reformulation would be insightful.
* **Theoretical Analysis of Convergence:**  While the paper focuses on the formulation, a theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of BETA-AT would strengthen the theoretical contribution.


Despite these minor suggestions, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of adversarial robustness by exposing a significant limitation of current practices and proposing a promising alternative. The non-zero-sum bilevel formulation opens up new avenues for research in AT and could inspire future work on designing more robust and efficient algorithms.
