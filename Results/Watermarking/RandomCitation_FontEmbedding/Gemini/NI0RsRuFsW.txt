OUTPUT:
This paper explores the challenging problem of Trojan detection in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), specifically focusing on the development of evasive Trojans that can bypass existing detection methods.  The authors contribute a novel method for generating these evasive Trojans, leveraging a distribution matching loss inspired by the Wasserstein distance, coupled with specificity and randomization losses.

The strength of the paper lies in its comprehensive experimental evaluation. The authors train over 6,000 Trojaned networks across various datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, GTSRB) and benchmark their performance against a diverse set of detection techniques, including both established methods and simple baselines.  Impressively, their evasive Trojans significantly degrade the performance of these detectors, often reducing accuracy to near-chance levels.  Furthermore, the authors make the surprising discovery that these evasive Trojans are also harder to reverse-engineer, hindering the identification of the target label and trigger, which has important implications for defense mechanisms.

The methodology presented is well-motivated and technically sound. The distribution matching loss aims to make the distribution of Trojaned networks resemble that of clean networks, making them harder to distinguish. The specificity loss addresses the potential vulnerability of Trojans being triggered by unintended inputs, while the randomization loss prevents emergent coordination in the parameter space, further enhancing evasiveness.

The paper's clarity and organization are commendable.  The authors provide sufficient background information on Trojan attacks and detection methods, clearly articulate their threat model and methodology, and present their experimental results in a concise and interpretable manner. The inclusion of ablations and analysis further strengthens the paper, providing insights into the contribution of each component of their evasion loss.

However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved.  While the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method against a wide range of detectors, a discussion of potential limitations and future research directions would be beneficial.  For instance, the computational cost of generating evasive Trojans could be addressed.  Additionally, exploring the effectiveness of their method against newer or more sophisticated detection techniques would further strengthen the paper's claims.

Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of Trojan detection.  The proposed method for generating evasive Trojans is novel and effective, and the comprehensive experimental evaluation provides strong evidence for its efficacy.  The surprising finding regarding the difficulty of reverse-engineering evasive Trojans further underscores the significance of this work and highlights the need for continued research in developing robust Trojan detection and mitigation techniques.
