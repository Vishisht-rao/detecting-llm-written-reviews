OUTPUT:
This paper presents a novel "one-shot" approach for empirically estimating privacy loss in federated learning (FL), addressing shortcomings of existing methods that require retraining, make strong adversarial assumptions, and are often tailored to specific tasks or architectures.  The proposed technique efficiently estimates privacy under user-level differential privacy (DP) by measuring the algorithm's memorization of randomly generated "canary" client updates.

**Strengths:**

* **Efficiency:** The one-shot nature eliminates the need for costly retraining, making it practical for FL settings where training is time-consuming.  It allows auditing within the same training run used for model optimization.
* **Generality:** The method is model, task, and dataset agnostic, enabling easy application across diverse FL applications. It does not assume specific knowledge of the model architecture, task, or DP training algorithm.
* **Flexible Adversary Model:**  It handles arbitrary client participation patterns, going beyond the limitations of existing techniques that often assume uniform sampling.  It explores different threat models, including observation of all intermediate updates versus only the final model.
* **Theoretical Foundation:**  The paper provides a theoretical justification, proving that the method correctly recovers the analytical epsilon in the simplified case of the Gaussian mechanism in high dimensions.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Not a Formal Bound:** The estimated epsilon is not a formal upper bound on the worst-case privacy leakage. While a low epsilon suggests difficulty in membership inference, it's not a definitive guarantee.  Further investigation is needed to connect the metric to formal privacy bounds.
* **Reliance on Canary Insertion:** The method requires inserting canary clients, which, while minimally impacting accuracy in the presented experiments, could potentially be detectable or manipulated by a sophisticated adversary.  Further exploration of the robustness against such manipulation is needed.
* **Limited Empirical Evaluation:** While experiments are provided on StackOverflow and EMNIST datasets, broader evaluation on different datasets, models, and FL settings would strengthen the empirical validation.

**Overall:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to privacy estimation in FL by introducing a practical and efficient one-shot method. The theoretical grounding and flexible adversary model are notable strengths. While the lack of a formal privacy bound and the reliance on canary insertion require further investigation, the method offers a promising approach for empirically assessing privacy risks in real-world FL deployments.  The ability to analyze privacy under realistic client participation patterns and different threat models makes it a valuable tool for practitioners. The work opens interesting directions for future research, including establishing connections to formal privacy bounds and investigating the robustness of the canary insertion process.
