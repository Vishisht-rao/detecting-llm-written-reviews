The paper "GRepsNet: A Simple Equivariant Network for Arbitrary Matrix Groups" introduces a novel architecture for building group equivariant neural networks.  The core idea is elegantly simple: replace scalar representations in standard networks with tensor representations and use appropriate mixing operations to maintain equivariance. This approach avoids the computational expense of basis function methods like EMLPs while still handling arbitrary matrix groups.

The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of GRepsNet on a variety of tasks and datasets.  The comparisons with EMLPs on synthetic datasets are particularly compelling, showing competitive performance with significantly reduced computational cost. The application of GRepsNet to diverse domains like image classification (with MLP-Mixers and CNNs), PDE solving (with FNOs), and N-body dynamics prediction (with MPNNs) highlights its flexibility and broad applicability.  The surprising effectiveness of even simple first-order tensor representations is a notable finding.  Furthermore, the introduction of second-order tensors for equivariant finetuning, outperforming existing methods, opens interesting new avenues for research.

The paper is well-written and clearly explains the GRepsNet architecture and its theoretical underpinnings. The proof of equivariance is concise and easy to follow. The experimental setup is detailed, and the results are presented clearly. The inclusion of practical design insights and ablation studies strengthens the paper further.

However, there are some areas for improvement. While the authors mention the computational advantages of GRepsNet over EMLPs, a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity and memory footprint would be beneficial.  A discussion on the limitations of GRepsNet, particularly for very large groups or high-order tensors, would also be valuable.  Expanding the experiments to include more complex real-world datasets would further strengthen the claims.  Finally, while the universality of GRepsNet is proven, an analysis of its expressiveness compared to other equivariant architectures would be insightful.

Overall, this paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of equivariant neural networks.  The GRepsNet architecture is simple yet powerful, offering a scalable and computationally efficient way to incorporate group equivariance into various network architectures.  The experimental results are promising and suggest that GRepsNet has the potential to be a widely applicable tool for learning in the presence of group symmetries.  Addressing the minor points raised above would further enhance the impact of this work.
