OUTPUT:
Following Johnson et al. (2021), this paper presents advancements in the domain of privacy estimation for training algorithms by introducing a "one-shot" empirical privacy estimation method tailored for Federated Learning (FL). The primary innovation here circumvents the need for retraining models multiple times to assess the privacy loss, which is particularly valuable given the resource-intensive nature of FL.

### Strengths:

1. **Novelty and Contribution:** 
   - The paper addresses the significant challenge of evaluating differential privacy (DP) in federated settings, where traditional methods may not scale well due to the complexity of training models multiple times.
   - By leveraging isotropically sampled random canaries, the method efficiently estimates privacy loss with only a single training run, making it suitable for large-scale FL tasks, which is a noteworthy contribution to the field.
   
2. **Theoretical Foundation:** 
   - The theoretical proofs underpinning the asymptotic behavior of the proposed statistics are detailed. The convergence in probability to desired constants under conditions presented in Theorem 3.3 is substantial.
   - The use of Gaussian approximations and analytical results to support the estimation strategy provides a solid theoretical foundation.
   
3. **Practical Utility:** 
   - The method seems immediately applicable, as it requires minimal changes to existing FL workflows. Integrating the auditing during the existing training run without any foreknowledge of the model, task, or data enhances its practicality.
   - The experimental results on large-scale datasets like Stack Overflow demonstrate its applicability in real-world scenarios.

4. **Comprehensive Analysis:** 
   - The paper not only introduces the method but also evaluates it under several threat models, emphasizing the difference between analyzing privacy loss when observing only final models versus intermediate updates.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Experimental Limitations:**
   - While the empirical results cover a couple of datasets, further validation across a more diverse set of datasets would strengthen claims of generality.
   - The paper would benefit from comparison to a broader set of existing methods rather than primarily focusing on CANIFE, especially considering multifaceted adversarial scenarios not extensively covered.

2. **Assumptions and Limitations:** 
   - Some assumptions, like the high-dimensionality and isotropy of updates, while theoretically addressed, may not translate linearly to all practical scenarios, especially with varied data distributions.
   - The model ignores potential interferences when inserting multiple canaries, as discussed only briefly in the appendix. Evaluation in real-world non-orthogonal setups would add to robustness.

3. **Discussion on Real-World Deployment:**
   - While hypothetical technological advancements like TEEs are mentioned as a use case, a more concrete discussion on deployment challenges in current infrastructures would ground the findings.
   - The section on limitations tends to downplay potential over or underestimation inaccuracies in non-ideal conditions (e.g., low dimensionality or non-i.i.d. data).

### Conclusion:

The paper makes a significant contribution to the domain of differential privacy in federated learning by proposing a method that is both practical and efficient. While some experimental and theoretical areas could be expanded, the results suggest a promising direction for practical applications in scalable privacy auditing. The novel approach bodes well for further exploration, potentially influencing future standard methodologies in FL privacy estimation. Overall, the paper is a commendable work contributing toward tackling the crucial concern of privacy in modern federated learning systems.Following Johnson et al. (2021), this paper investigates privacy estimation methods for differentially private algorithms, particularly focusing on federated learning (FL) settings. The authors introduce an innovative "one-shot" empirical privacy estimation technique that addresses significant limitations of existing privacy auditing methods in the context of FL. Current methods often necessitate multiple retraining rounds, rely on substantial knowledge of intermediate model states, and are tailored to specific models or tasks, making them impractical for large-scale deployments in federated environments where model training is resource-intensive.

The proposed technique efficiently estimates privacy loss within a single training run, obviating the need for repeated model retraining. It operates without prior knowledge of the model architecture, task, or differential privacy algorithm details. This methodological advancement hinges on inserting random "canary" updates into the training protocol and using the cosine angles between these canaries and the final model to infer privacy loss. The method capitalizes on the geometric property that isotropically sampled vectors in high-dimensional spaces tend to be orthogonal, enabling the construction of meaningful metrics for privacy estimation.

The authors assert the robustness of their method by benchmarking it against the Gaussian mechanism in DP and demonstrate its efficacy on FL benchmark datasets under various adversarial threat models. By providing empirical estimates of privacy loss, they offer a practical analytic tool that complements theoretical DP guarantees, particularly in scenarios lacking tight analytical bounds.

The paper is well-structured, starting with a thorough introduction to the problem of privacy estimation in federated learning, followed by background information on differential privacy and existing auditing techniques. It then details the novel method, with theoretical proofs supporting the asymptotic correctness of the privacy estimates.

Experimental results are robustly presented, comparing the one-shot technique against prior methods like CANIFE. The reported estimates show that the technique provides meaningful insight consistent with expected privacy loss across a range of noise levels applied during differentially private learning. The experiments are meticulously designed to highlight the method's strengths across various conditions, including cases where only the final model is available to an attacker—emphasizing the broad applicability and utility of the method in practical FL deployments.

In conclusion, the work makes substantial contributions by providing an efficient and scalable method for privacy auditing in federated learning settings, overcoming significant challenges in the scalability and adaptability of existing approaches. This advancement will likely foster broader adoption of differential privacy in real-world federated learning systems, where deployment constraints necessitate such one-shot and architecture-agnostic solutions. The paper’s fidelity in explanation, theoretical grounding, and experimental rigor make it a worthy contribution to ongoing efforts in privacy-preserving machine learning.
