Following Johnson et al. (2021), this paper presents a novel approach to enhancing the performance of Binarized Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNNs) by implementing decomposed 1-D binarized convolutions. The newly proposed model, OneBNet, is designed to maximize the effects of 1-D binarized convolutions, producing favorable results on CPU-based edge devices. The underlying motivation stems from the limitations observed in the traditional 2-D binarized convolutions, which often result in significant accuracy drops compared to their full-precision counterparts.

The methodology employed in the paper involves a strategic doubling of layers and application of the 1-D binarized convolutions both row-wise and column-wise. This approach is theorized to enhance the adjustment of activation distribution for each direction independently, thereby potentially improving performance without significantly increasing computational costs. Importantly, the paper analyzes the conditions under which 1-D binarized convolutions are beneficial, noting that while these convolutions can double certain layers' effects, they may not be suitable across all layers due to operational burdens, such as the increased numbers of element-wise non-linear operations.

The empirical evaluation of OneBNet employs several prominent datasets, including FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet. Notably, when using ResNet18 as a backbone, the model achieves impressive Top-1 accuracies: 93.4% on FashionMNIST, 93.6% on CIFAR10, and 67.3% on ImageNet (with teacher-student training yielding improvements of up to 68.4%). These results represent a notable improvement over the current state-of-the-art BCNNs.

One of the strengths of this paper is its detailed analysis of computational costs, providing insights into how model complexity can be balanced with performance improvements. This is particularly relevant in the context of edge devices, where computational resources are often limited. Moreover, the paper's systematic comparison with baseline models and state-of-the-art methods adds credibility to the reported improvements.

However, there are a few areas of improvement that the paper could address. Firstly, while the paper describes the experimental setups and results thoroughly, it could benefit from a more extensive discussion on the limitations or potential drawbacks of the proposed method. This could involve broader consideration of real-world deployment scenarios, where power consumption and real-time processing capabilities are critical. Secondly, the theoretical aspects of why the decomposed 1-D convolutions work as they do could be more deeply elaborated, potentially with more formal mathematical underpinnings to strengthen the claims made.

Additionally, while the teacher-student training method is highlighted for its performance benefits, further exploration into the specific components or adjustments contributing most significantly to performance improvements could be insightful. This could guide further refinements in model training strategies.

Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of BCNNs by introducing an innovative structural approach to leveraging 1-D binarized convolutions. The methodology is well-justified, and the experimental results robustly support the efficacy of OneBNet. Future research could explore further optimization techniques and extensions to different network architectures, expanding the applicability of the proposed approach.
