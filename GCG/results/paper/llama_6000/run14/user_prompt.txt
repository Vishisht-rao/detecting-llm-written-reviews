Abstract: In this paper ∗–compatible extensions of fuzzy relations are studied, generalizing some results obtained by Duggan in case of crisp relations. From this general result are obtained as particular cases fuzzy versions of some important extension theorems for crisp relations (Szpilrajn, Hansson, Suzumura). Two notions of consistent closure of a fuzzy relation are introduced.

1 Introduction: In his seminal paper [23] Szpilrajn proved an extension theorem of a strict partial order to a total strict order. This result led afterwards to other extension theorems [3], [4], [11], [21]. Szpilrajn’s theorem and other extension theorems derived from economics have been intensely used in the classical choice theory [20], [22], [26].
As known, rationality is one of the main attributes which are taken into account in the analysis of economic decisions. An agent chooses between different alternatives; the rationality of the act of choice is defined by a preference relation acting on the alternatives. According to the context, the preference relation must satisfy some properties. Among these, transitivity acts extremely prolifically in classical consumer theory [20], [21], [22]. Still there exist situations when transitivity is a too strong condition. The notion of consistency was introduced by Suzumura in [21] in order to weaken transitivity.
In choice theory two types of extension relations appear. The first one represents merely the inclusion: ”relationQ extends relation R” means that R ⊆ Q. If we interpret a relation as expressing the preference between alternatives, this type of extension preserves the preference. The second type of extension is determined by two inclusions: ”relation Q extends relation R” if R ⊆ Q and PR ⊆ PQ (here, PR, PQ are the asymmetric parts of R, Q). Since the
asymmetric part PR is interpreted as the strict preference, it follows that these extensions preserve the preference and the strict preference. For the second type extensions, Duggan [10] uses the notion ”compatible extensions”. Suzumura’s theorem [21] links the consistency with the compatible extensions: a relation is consistent iff it admits a total and transitive compatible extension.
In [10] Duggan establishes a very general result which encompasses the theorems of Szpilrajn [23], Hansson [17], Suzumura [21], Dushnik–Miller [11] and Donaldson–Weymark [9] and other new particular cases. Duggan’s theorem provides total compatible extensions for various classes of crisp relations.
Paper [13] has been an attempt to obtain for fuzzy relations a result similar to Duggan’s extension theorem. In the setting of fuzzy sets theory associated with the Gödel t-norm [16] a concept of compatible extension of a fuzzy relation and one of consistent fuzzy relation (transitive–consistent in the terminology of [4], [13]) have been defined. The main result of [13] is an extension theorem for fuzzy relations which generalizes Proposition 9 from [10]. As particular cases fuzzy versions of Szpilrajn, Hansson and Suzumura theorems have been obtained.
In defining the meaning of compatible extension of a fuzzy relation R the asymmetric part of R, PR comes in, notion in whose expression appears the negation corresponding to the Gödel t-norm. Since this negation takes only the values 0 and 1, an important part of the information on the fuzzy preference relation R (therefore on the act of choice) is lost.
This paper aims to define a concept of compatible extension which should avoid the negation. One starts from the remark that, in the classical case, the definition of the compatible extension and of the consistency can be done in terms of the Boolean implication (see Lemma 4.2). This fact suggests the definition of the ∗–compatible extension, concept which is expressed using only the residuum → associated with a left–continuous t–norm ∗ (see [16], [18]). Accordingly, we shall also obtain a notion of ∗–consistency.
Once done this step, this idea is to redo in a fuzzy context the proof of Duggan’s theorem, by essentially using the structure of residuated lattice of the interval [0, 1].
In Section 2 the main extension theorems are recalled: Szpilrajn, Hansson, Suzumura, Dushnik-Miller and Donaldson–Weymark and also Duggan’s General Extension Theorem. It is separately stated (Theorem 2.4) that part of Duggan’s results which constitutes the generalization of the theorems of Szpilrajn, Hansson and Suzumura. Section 3 presents some definitions and properties of left–continuous t–norms, the associated residuation structure and the fuzzy relations.
Section 4 is the core of the paper. For a left–continuous t–norm ∗ we define the concepts of ∗–compatible extension and ∗–consistent fuzzy relation. If ∗ is the Gödel t-norm ∧, then any ∧–compatible extension is compatible (in the sense of [13]) but the converse does not hold. The main results are two extension theorems. Both are fuzzy extensions of Theorem 2.4. The first one is stated in the framework offered by a left–continuous t–norm. One proved that if the ∗–compatibility of the fuzzy relations is ”transitive” then the fuzzy version of
Theorem 2.4 is valid. For the Gödel t-norm, this property is verified. One obtains then the second extension theorem, which is exactly the fuzzy form of Theorem 2.4 for the Gödel t-norm.
Section 5 concerns some particular cases of extension theorems. In Section 6 to each fuzzy relation R on X one associates two fuzzy relations R∆ and R∇ 1 . R∆ and R∇ are in general different, but both extend the notion of consistent closure of a crisp relation [3]. For the Gödel t-norm we have R∆ = R∇ and this is the smallest ∧–consistent fuzzy relation on X including R.

2 Classical extension theorems: In this section the extension theorems of Szpilrajn, Hansson, Suzumura, DushnikMiller and Donaldson–Weymark are recalled. The extension theorem of Duggan is a very general result which encompasses all these theorems.
Consider a universe X of alternatives and a (crisp) binary relation R on X . The binary relation PR = {(x, y)|(x, y) ∈ R and (y, x) /∈ R} is called the asymmetric part of R. We denote by T (R) the transitive closure of R (the smallest transitive relation containing R). A preorder (resp. weak order) on X is a reflexive and transitive (resp. reflexive, transitive and total) relation on X . If a relation R on X is irreflexive and transitive then it is called a strict partial order on X ; a strict partial order is called strict total order if it is total.
Let R,Q be two relations on X . Q is called an extension (resp. a compatible extension) of R if R ⊆ Q (resp. R ⊆ Q and PR ⊆ PQ). R is a consistent relation if T (R) is a compatible extension of R, i.e. PR ⊆ PT (R). Of course a transitive relation is consistent but the converse assertion is not true.
Theorem 2.1 [23] (Szpilrajn) Any strict partial order on X can be extended to a strict total order on X.
Theorem 2.2 [17] (Hansson) Any preorder on X can be extended to a total preorder on X.
Theorem 2.3 [21] (Suzumura) A relation on X has a total, transitive and compatible extension iff it is consistent.
For any relation R and x, y ∈ X denote R[x, y] = R ∪ {(x, y)}. A family R of relations on X is closed upward if ⋃
C ∈ R for any chain C ⊆ R; R is said to be arc–receptive if for all transitive relations R ∈ R and for all distinct x 6= y, (y, x) /∈ R implies T (R[x, y]) ∈ R.
We recall two results of [10].
