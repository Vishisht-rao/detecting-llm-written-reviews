Abstract: Originating from Allen’s Interval Algebra, composition-based reasoning has been widely acknowledged as the most popular reasoning technique in qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning. Given a qualitative calculus (i.e. a relation model), the first thing we should do is to establish its composition table (CT). In the past three decades, such work is usually done manually. This is undesirable and error-prone, given that the calculus may contain tens or hundreds of basic relations. Computing the correct CT has been identified by Tony Cohn as a challenge for computer scientists in 1995. This paper addresses this problem and introduces a semi-automatic method to compute the CT by randomly generating triples of elements. For several important qualitative calculi, our method can establish the correct CT in a reasonable short time. This is illustrated by applications to the Interval Algebra, the Region Connection Calculus RCC-8, the INDU calculus, and the Oriented Point Relation Algebras. Our method can also be used to generate CTs for customised qualitative calculi defined on restricted domains.

1 Introduction: Since Allen’s seminal work of Interval Algebra (IA) [1,2], qualitative calculi have been widely used to represent and reason about temporal and spatial knowledge. In the past decades, dozens of qualitative calculi have been proposed in the artificial intelligence area “Qualitative Spatial & Temporal Reasoning” and Geographic Information Science. Except IA, other well known binary qualitative calculi include the Point Algebra [3], the Region Connection Calculi RCC-5 and RCC-8 [4], the INDU calculus [5], the Oriented Point Relation Algebras OPRA [6], and the Cardinal Direction Calculus (CDC) [7], etc.
Relations in each particular qualitative calculus are used to represent temporal or spatial information at a certain granularity. For example, The Netherlands is west of Germany, The Alps partially overlaps Italy, I have today an appointment with my doctor followed by a check-up.
Given a set of qualitative knowledge, new knowledge can be derived by using constraint propagation. Consider an example in RCC-5. Given that The Alps partially overlaps Italy and Switzerland, and Italy is a proper part of the European Union (EU), and Switzerland is discrete from the EU, we may infer that The Alps partially overlaps the EU. The above inference can be obtained by using composition-based reasoning. The composition-based reasoning technique has been extensively used in qualitative

2 spatial and temporal reasoning, and, when combined with backtracking methods, has been shown to be complete in determining the consistency problem for several important qualitative calculi, including IA, Point Algebra, Rectangle Algebra, RCC-5, and RCC-8. Moreover, qualitative constraint solvers have been developed to facilitate composition-based reasoning [8,9].
We here give a short introduction of the composition-based reasoning technique. SupposeM is a qualitative calculus, and Γ = {viγijvj}ni,j=1 is a constraint network overM. The composition-based reasoning technique uses a variant of the well-known Path Consistency Algorithm,1 which applies the following updating rule until the constraint network becomes stable or an empty relation appears:
γij ← γij ∩ γik ◦w γkj , (1)
where α ◦w β is the weak composition (cf. [10,11]) of two relations α, β inM, namely the smallest relation inM which contains the usual composition of α and β. Although for OPRA and some other calculi the composition-based reasoning is incomplete to decide the consistency problem, it remains a very efficient method to approximately solve the consistency problem.
The weak composition in a qualitative calculusM is determined by its weak composition table (CT for short). Usually, the CT ofM is obtained by manually checking the consistency of {xαy, yβz, xγz} for each triple of basic relations 〈α, γ, β〉. When M contains dozens or even hundreds of basic relations, this consistency-based method is undesirable and error-prone. [12] first noticed this problem and identified it as a challenge for computer scientists.
This problem remains a challenge today. We here consider several examples. The Interval Algebra and the RCC-8 algebra contain, respectively, 13 and 8 basic relations. Their CTs were established manually. But if a calculus contains a hundred basic relations, we need to determine the consistency of one million such basic networks. This is manually impossible. The OPRA calculi and the CDC are large qualitative spatial calculi that have drawn increasing interests. OPRAm contains 4m × (4m + 1) (i.e. 72, 156, 272 for m = 2, 3, 4, respectively) basic relations [6], while the CDC contains 218 basic relations [7]. Sometimes we need ingenious and special methods to establish CT for such a calculus. For the OPRA calculi, the algorithm presented in the original paper [6] contains gaps and errors. Later, [13] presented the second algorithm, which is quite lengthy and cumbersome. Another simple algorithm has also been proposed recently [14]. Given the huge number of basic relations of OPRAm, the validity of these algorithms need further verification. As for the CDC, [7] first studied the weak composition. Later, [15] noticed errors in Goyal’s method and gave a new algorithm to compute the weak composition. Unfortunately, in several cases, their algorithm does not generate the correct weak composition (see [16]).
In this paper, we respond to this challenge and propose a semi-automatic approach to generate CT for general qualitative calculi. In the remainder of this paper, we first recall basic notions and results about qualitative calculi and weak composition tables in Section 2, and then apply our method to IA, INDU, RCC-8, andOPRA1 andOPRA2
1 The notion of Path Consistency is usually defined for constraints on finite domains, and not always appropriate for general qualitative constraints, which are defined on infinite domains.

2 Preliminaries: In this section we recall the notions of qualitative calculi and their weak composition tables. Interested readers may consult e.g. [17,11] for more information.
Definition 1. Suppose U is a universe of spatial or temporal entities, and B is a set of jointly exhaustive and pairwise disjoint (JEPD) binary relations on U . We call the Boolean algebra generated by B a qualitative calculus, and call relations in B the basic relations of this qualitative calculus.
We consider a simple example.
Example 1 (Point Algebra). Suppose U = R. For two points a, b in U , we have either a < b, or a = b, or a > b. Let B = {<,=, >}. Then B is a JEPD set of relations on U . We call the Boolean Algebra generated by B the Point Algebra.
We next recall the central notion of weak composition.
Definition 2. SupposeM is a qualitative calculus on U , and B is the set of its basic relations. The weak composition of two basic relations α and β inM, denoted as α ◦w β, is defined as the smallest relation inM which contains α ◦ β, the usual composition of α and β.
Usually, a qualitative calculus has a finite set of relations. The weak composition operation ofM can be summarised in an n×n table, where n is the cardinality of B, and the cell specified by α and β contains all basic relations γ in B such that γ∩α◦β 6= ∅. The CT of the Point Algebra is given in Table 1.
Definition 3. SupposeM is a qualitative calculus on U with basic relation set B. For basic relations α, β, γ, we call 〈α, γ, β〉 a composition triad, or c-triad, if γ ⊆ α ◦w β. We can determine if a 3-tuple is a c-triad as follows (cf. Fig. 1).
Proposition 1. A 3-tuple 〈α, γ, β〉 of basic relations inM is a c-triad iff γ∩α◦β 6= ∅, which is equivalent to saying that the basic constraint network
