Write a review for the following paper.

Abstract: Human intuition has been simulated by several research projects using artificial intelligence techniques. Most of these algorithms or models lack the ability to handle complications or diversions. Moreover, they also do not explain the factors influencing intuition and the accuracy of the results from this process. In this paper, we present a simple series based model for implementation of human-like intuition using the principles of connectivity and unknown entities. By using Poker hand datasets and Car evaluation datasets, we compare the performance of some well-known models with our intuition model. The aim of the experiment was to predict the maximum accurate answers using intuition based models. We found that the presence of unknown entities, diversion from the current problem scenario, and identifying weakness without the normal logic based execution, greatly affects the reliability of the answers. Generally, the intuition based models cannot be a substitute for the logic based mechanisms in handling such problems. The intuition can only act as a support for an ongoing logic based model that processes all the steps in a sequential manner. However, when time and computational cost are very strict constraints, this intuition based model becomes extremely important and useful, because it can give a reasonably good performance. Factors affecting intuition are analyzed and interpreted through our model.

2. Methodology: Intuition offers the ability to obtain answers much faster than the normal process of logic-based thinking. Here, we propose an intuition based model which attempts to simulate intuition for quickly obtaining accurate results for a given dataset. We downloaded the datasets for Car Evaluation and Poker Game from the online UCI repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets). This model will be
explained in Section 2.2 (Experimental Detail). First, let us explain the theory and formulation of this intuition model.

2.1 Theory and Formulation: We consider the following sets for explaining our model:-
1) Problem Set at time t ---> At = {-∞,…, @, $, *, % , 4, 6 , 555, 0.333, -3.444, - 4,…………………, ∞ } 2) Experience Set at time t---> Bt = {-∞,… ,1, 2 ,S, R, L, 8, 9, #, 1.2 , -0.44 ,………………………… ∞}
Please note that we consider the above sets as dynamic and changing values at time “t”. The above elements and sets may be of any type, dimension, or value. We represent them in simple static elements as a simple representation of the corresponding problem. For example, the problem could be about “What is the expected score that this batting team will get in this match?” or “What is the expected GPA score that I will be able to get this semester”. There are several such problems and questions that can exist in the real brain and we propose to represent them here as Problem Set elements for simplicity. Each of the problem set elements shows a representation of such a question or problem. Moreover, the vast knowledge in the brain is represented as Experience Set elements. Each of the experience is representing values as done in the problem set (the representation is similar to the problem set). For example, the number “4.0/5.0” could be one of the answers to the past question on “How much GPA score did I get last year?” or “How much GPA score did I get in my first year?” (Note that the question is not as same as the current problem. This is the past experience and shall store past values only. It does not guarantee the end solution, but maybe a means to the latter). All such values are mapped as elements in the Experience Set. We also propose that one normal process may not be enough to execute one intuition process. Sometimes, there are multiple normal processes which may act together and dependent for a single intuition process. The work of the intuition model is to find the right solution using the correct experience element in the Experience set, process it as per its methodology and then send it as final solution to the current problem at hand. Figure 1 explains the intuition model with a single problem set element at hand for ease of explanation. We believe that there are two processes that are carried out in the brain. One of them is the normal process (referred to as NP in below) and intuition based process (IP). The NP carries out the processing of problems using normal logic based approaches, in which the information related to the problem is gathered and connected to infer the solution. But the IP uses a different approach – a comparison based approach – which retrieves values from past experience that could serve as the solution for the given problem. Current approaches of intuition have a very logical and analytical form of processing. However, in reality, intuition is known to be symbolic and artistic rather than logical. Intuition may take an “O” as a circle while a logical normal process takes this to be zero or an English alphabet. Intuition does not use the normal logic based approaches, but it uses basic mapping of the past experience in similar problem as an attempt to solve the current problem at hand. Therefore IP can be considered as a mapping function with the required adjustments and weight factors at the given time ‘t’.
Past experience is a major factor in shaping the intuition of the entity or person. The brain has to simply map it to the past experience and the result is sent back to the user after a minor modification to the answer. The brain continuously manages to learn process and store value from the past experience. It may also develop multiple interpretations for the same experience set after a period of time. This may be due to a change in the element’s priority, importance or even mapping as the correct intuition result. For example, in the game of soccer, the brain has developed two ways of finding the possible winner of the match. One way is to use the normal process, where past statistics are seen and understood such as past games won or lost by each side, players and their strengths, etc. In the second method, the brain looks at the teams and just maps it to a past experience similar but not necessarily identical to the current problem (for example, the team wearing blue shirts looks better because of other experience not related to soccer). The mapping returns a value based on the confidence level, priority and importance level. Thus, the accuracy of the intuition depends on the correct choice of experience that fits the current scenario, confidence and importance to the brain of the problem. If these are correct, then the intuition gives correct value. The steps in our intuition model (Figure 1) are as follows:-
1) Obtain an element from the problem set. 2) Obtain an element from the experience set based on a mapping. 3) Obtain the importance, priority of the processes to obtain the probabilistic value of the dependent
thinking processes. 4) Obtain the secondary thought processes (intuition based or normal based process) into the
considered formulae in the same manner. Note that these will be dependent processes. 5) Apply the adjustment factor on all the considered processes. Calculate the final answer. 6) Check if there are any external influences that change the values and then present the answer to
the user after these final adjustments. This may include mental balance of the human or machine entity, thinking capacity(to undertake intuition), etc.
The formula to find the intuition based result of problem is given by:
f(x)t = Mapping Fn( f(x) t) + Adjustment Factor where, Mapping Fn (f(x) t) = [P (IP/NP) * Importance (IP) + Priority (Exp. Set element)] + [Exp Set
element value] + P (External Changes Factors)
where,
1) f(x) t = the functional representation of intuition at time ‘t’ . 2) P (IP/NP) = Probability that IP happens in the presence of NP. We strongly believe that IP
cannot exist or happen without the prior presence or execution of the NP process. Note that there can be multiple normal processes dependent for a single intuition process. P (IP/NP) = P (IP / NP1 * NP2 * NP3….∞)
3) IP = intuition based process. It is the process that handles the intuition based model. 4) NP = normal based process. It is the process that handles the normal functioning of the brain.
It involves normal calculations and logical thinking. The implementation of thinking process
may use algorithms such as neural networks (NN), decision trees, bayesian inference, hidden markov models (HMM), etc. We have considered NN, HMM for our experiments in this paper.
5) Priority (Exp Set element) = This term defines the priority of the experiment set element(experience knowledge set) that has been mapped to the problem set element as the solution. 6) Imp (IP) = This variable defines the importance of the IP process to
