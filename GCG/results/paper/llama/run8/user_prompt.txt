Write a review for the following paper.

Abstract: Case Based Reasoning and particularly Estimation by Analogy, has been used in a number of problem-solving areas, such as cost estimation. Conventional methods, despite the lack of a sound criterion for choosing nearest projects, were based on estimation using a fixed and predetermined number of neighbors from the entire set of historical instances. This approach puts boundaries to the estimation ability of such algorithms, for they do not take into consideration that every project under estimation is unique and requires different handling. The notion of distributions of distances together with a distance metric for distributions help us to adapt the proposed method (we call it DD-EbA) each time to a specific case that is to be estimated without loosing in prediction power or computational cost. The results of this paper show that the proposed technique achieves the above idea in a very efficient way.

1 Introduction: The last few years we observe a continuous technological orgasm, which has to do with the importance software has taken in our every day life. As human activity becomes more and more complicated, the need of even more exigent systems seems vital. A demanding system however has demanding requirements regarding the development procedure. A project manager is the one who has to confront the issue in many perspectives, either has it to do with risk management matters, defect prediction etc or effort and time requirements. Effort requirements in means of effort estimation is a task known as Software Cost estimation, which is essential in the early stages of the development and may be performed in any stage of the life cycle of the under estimation project.
To cope with this important task, a plethora of methods has been proposed (Jorgensen and Shepperd, 2007). These estimation methods fall in three main categories.
• Expert judgment, in which the calculation of effort is based on human judgment.
Although the technique is easy to apply and gives direct evaluation, because of the fact that it relies on instinctive processes is difficult to be in full analyzed (Berger, 1985; Silverman, 1985; Hammond, 1996 and Hogarth, 2005).
• Estimation by analogy (EbA), a form of Case Based Reasoning (Mukhopadhyay et al.,
1992). Main aspect of the technique is to use historical projects, the effort of which is known, to estimate a new one.
• Algorithmic cost estimation, i.e. COCOMO (Boehm, 1981) and Function Points
(Albrecht and Gaffney, 1983). These methods require the application of a cost model, via one or more mathematical equations calculated through statistical data analysis. These approaches, if used correctly and calibrated with historical data, seem to be very useful.
As discussed in Shepperd and Schofield (1997) there are certain advantages that appoint EbA the more attractive in respect with the other systems. In fact, users are more willing to accept solutions from analogy based systems since they are congener to human problem thinking and solving, in direct opposition with the awkward chains of rules or neural sets. As it uses historical projects and the similarity of them to the new project, in order to estimate the effort of the latter, a decision must be made considering what number of neighboring historical projects to use for the estimation. This is a limitation to the method and a variety of solutions has been introduced the last years. One of them, without requiring a predefined number of neighbors, calculates the number of the neighbors that gives the better estimate through the process of Leave – One – Out Cross Validation (LOOCV) (Mittas and Angelis, 2010). The method may define a number for neighbors to choose but the whole procedure is quite time consuming and that number is the same for all the under estimation projects.
Purpose of this paper is to present a new algorithm, which introduces a new notion of distance. It uses the similarity between distributions of distances instead of LOOCV to find the number of appropriate neighbors to be used for estimating new projects. The main characteristic of the proposed method is that it is much less time-consuming with respect to LOOCV EbA, and also adaptive to each project that is to be estimated, since it finds an optimal different number in every application. To explicate the above we discuss in Section 2 about LOOCV EbA, analyzing the
steps of the algorithm and afterwards, in Section 3, we introduce our algorithm DD-EbA. Section 4 has to do with the methodology we follow to test the accuracy of our method. In Section 5 we analyze the results of the proposed method and that of LOOCV EbA. Finally, Section 6 consists of a constructive discussion about the results and the new paths this approach opens. Finally, reflections are made about future work.
In this paper, experimentations are based on four well known datasets, namely the Maxwell dataset (Maxwell, 2002), the Desharnais dataset (Desharnais, 1989) and the COCOMO - NASA dataset (PROMISE). All statistical and simulation procedures in this study have been implemented with Matlab programming language.

2 Combined Estimation by analogy using LOOCV for determining the number of neighbors: Through the three formerly mentioned effort prediction categories, Estimation by Analogy (EbA) has been proposed as a valid technique, starting with Boehm (Boehm, 1981) and has been continuously enriched (Shepperd et al., 1996; Shepperd and Schofield, 1997) and applied on a number of cost data sets.
Main goal of the method is to predict the effort (cost) of the project under estimation (target case) using historical information from completed projects with known effort. After having characterized the new project with attributes (or features) 1 common to the ones of the historical dataset (training set), three basic steps must be followed.
1. Calculation of distances of the target case with the projects of the training set using a
distance metric (for example the Euclidean distance),
2. Choice of the nearest neighbors.
3. Effort estimation calculating a statistic (mean, median etc.) and using the efforts of the
projects selected in step 2.
An additional advantage of EbA, besides the one mentioned in the introduction, is that it is based on distance measures for finding the nearest neighbors and these measures can be easily calculated even for categorical variables. The limitations of the method have mainly to do with the characterization of the project to be estimated and the choice of the number of neighbors to
1 The features might be continuous, discrete or categorical and might include the number of interfaces, the level of code reuse, the programming language, the number of LOC etc.
use (Step 2) for the calculation of the estimate. As pointed out in the description of the method, when a new project arrives it must be inserted in an historical dataset, in which cases are described by a specific number of features. This means that the new project has to be described by exactly the same features. This is not a problem for software organizations that undertake projects in the same domain.
As for the limitation of having to predefine a specific number of neighbors, we already mentioned that LOOCV procedure has widely been applied. In each step of the procedure, a completed project Pi is removed from the dataset and the remaining projects are used for the estimation of its cost YE. The validation of the combined model is based on the YA (actual effort) and the YE (estimated from a predictor) values. The procedure is applied for a range of neighbors k = [1, … , kmax], that are given as an input for the estimation process. This is adopted to find an optimal number of nearest neighbors to the target case, in order to make the estimation. In the end of every test of k, an accuracy measure is calculated (MdAE, see Section 3) so as to chose that specific number of neighbors from the above range, which gives the minimum accuracy. This method is time consuming and lacks of adaption to each specific under estimation project.

3 DD-EbA algorithm description: DD-EbA in the present paper focuses on the limitation of the traditional method to choose a different number of neighbors for each target case. The traditional method has no criterion for doing that, which leads to the a priori choice of a fixed number of neighbors, without considering an optimal number for each target case. This means that when a new case has to be estimated, the number of neighbors for the estimation is predefined and fixed.
In this study we try to make a first step towards a new approach, which essentially determines the appropriate number of neighbors, separately for each specific new case to be estimated. This is a way of dynamic calculation of neighbors adapted to the special characteristics of each project under estimation. To achieve that, we assume that in the training set there is a unique project Pi that is similar to the target case Pnew in
