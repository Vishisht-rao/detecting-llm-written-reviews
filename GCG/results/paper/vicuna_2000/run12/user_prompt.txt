Write a review for the following paper.

Abstract: The success of kernel methods has initiated the design of novel positive semidefinite functions, in particular for structured data. A leading design paradigm for this is the convolution kernel, which decomposes structured objects into their parts and sums over all pairs of parts. Assignment kernels, in contrast, are obtained from an optimal bijection between parts, which can provide a more valid notion of similarity. In general however, optimal assignments yield indefinite functions, which complicates their use in kernel methods. We characterize a class of base kernels used to compare parts that guarantees positive semidefinite optimal assignment kernels. These base kernels give rise to hierarchies from which the optimal assignment kernels are computed in linear time by histogram intersection. We apply these results by developing the Weisfeiler-Lehman optimal assignment kernel for graphs. It provides high classification accuracy on widely-used benchmark data sets improving over the original Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel.

1 Introduction: The various existing kernel methods can conveniently be applied to any type of data, for which a kernel is available that adequately measures the similarity between any two data objects. This includes structured data like images [2, 5, 10], 3d shapes [1], chemical compounds [7] and proteins [4], which are often represented by graphs. Most kernels for structured data decompose both objects and add up the pairwise similarities between their parts following the seminal concept of convolution kernels proposed by Haussler [11]. In fact, many graph kernels can be seen as instances of convolution kernels under different decompositions [21].
A fundamentally different approach with good prospects is to assign the parts of one objects to the parts of the other, such that the total similarity between the assigned parts is maximum possible. Finding such a bijection is known as assignment problem and well-studied in combinatorial optimization. This approach has been successfully applied to graph comparison, e.g., in general graph matching [8, 15] as well as in kernel-based classification [7, 16, 1]. In contrast to convolution kernels, assignments establish structural correspondences and thereby alleviate the problem of diagonal dominance at the same time. However, the similarities derived in this way are not necessarily positive semidefinite (p.s.d.) [20, 21] and hence do not give rise to valid kernels, severely limiting their use in kernel methods.

Our goal in this paper is to consider a particular class of base kernels which give rise to valid assignment kernels. In the following we use the term valid to mean a kernel which is symmetric and positive semidefinite. We formalize the considered problem: Let [X ]n denote the set of all n-element subsets of a set X and B(X,Y ) the set of all bijections between X,Y in [X ]n for n ∈ N. We study the optimal assignment kernel KkB on [X ]n defined as
KkB(X,Y ) = max B∈B(X,Y )
W (B), where W (B) = ∑
(x,y)∈B k(x, y) (1)
and k is a base kernel on X . For clarity of presentation we assume n to be fixed. In order to apply the kernel to data sets, where n is variable, we may fill up smaller sets by new objects z with k(z, x) = 0 for all x ∈ X without changing the result.
Related work. Correspondence problems have been extensively studied in object recognition, where objects are represented by sets of features often called bag of words. Grauman and Darrell proposed the pyramid match kernel that seeks to approximate correspondences between points in Rd by employing a space-partitioning tree structure and counting how often points fall into the same bin [10]. An adaptive partitioning with non-uniformly shaped bins was used to improve the approximation quality in high dimensions [9].
For non-vectorial data, Fröhlich et al. [7] proposed kernels for graphs derived from an optimal assignment between their vertices and applied the approach to molecular graphs. However, it was shown that the resulting similarity measure is not necessarily a valid kernel [20]. Therefore, Vishwanathan et al. [21] proposed a theoretically well-founded variation of the kernel, which essentially replaces the max-function in Eq. (1) by a soft-max function. Besides introducing an additional parameter, which must be chosen carefully to avoid numerical difficulties, the approach requires the evaluation of a sum over all possible assignments instead of finding a single optimal one. This leads to an increase in running time from cubic to factorial, which is infeasible in practice. Pachauri et al. [14] considered the problem of finding optimal assignments between multiple sets. The problem is equivalent to finding a permutation of the elements of every set, such that assigning the i-th elements to each other yields an optimal result. Solving this problem allows the derivation of valid kernels between pairs of sets with a fixed ordering. This approach was referred to as transitive assignment kernel in [16] and employed for graph classification. However, this does not only lead to non-optimal assignments between individual pairs of graphs, but also suffers from high computational costs.
Various general approaches to cope with indefinite kernels have been proposed, in particular, for support vector machines (see [13] and references therein). Such approaches should principally be used in applications, where similarities cannot be expressed by positive semidefinite kernels.
Our contribution. We study optimal assignment kernels in more detail and investigate which base kernels lead to valid optimal assignment kernels. We characterize a specific class of kernels we refer to as strong and show that strong kernels are equivalent to kernels obtained from a hierarchical partition of the domain of the kernel. We show that for strong base kernels the optimal assignment (i) yields a valid kernel; and (ii) can be computed in linear time given the associated hierarchy. While the computation reduces to histogram intersection similar to the pyramid match kernel [10], our approach is in no way restricted to specific objects like points in Rd. We demonstrate the versatility of our results by deriving novel graph kernels based on optimal assignments, which are shown to improve over their convolution-based counterparts. In particular, we propose the Weisfeiler-Lehman optimal assignment kernel, which performs favourable compared to state-of-the-art graph kernels on a wide range of data sets.

2 Preliminaries: Before continuing with our contribution, we begin by introducing some key notation for kernels and trees which will be used later. A (valid) kernel on a set X is a function k : X × X → R such that there is a real Hilbert space H and a mapping φ : X → H such that k(x, y) = 〈φ(x), φ(y)〉 for all x, y in X , where 〈·, ·〉 denotes the inner product of H. We call φ a feature map, and H a feature space. Equivalently, a function k : X × X → R is a kernel if and only if for every subset {x1, . . . , xn} ⊆ X the n× n matrix defined by [m]i,j = k(xi, xj) is p.s.d. The Dirac kernel kδ is defined by kδ(x, y) = 1, if x = y and 0 otherwise.
We consider simple undirected graphs G = (V,E), where V (G) = V is the set of vertices and E(G) = E the set of edges. An edge {u, v} is for short denoted by uv or vu, where both refer to the same edge. A graph with a unique path between any two vertices is a tree. A rooted tree is a tree T with a distinguished vertex r ∈ V (T ) called root. The vertex following v on the path to the root r is called parent of v and denoted by p(v), where p(r) = r. The vertices on this path are called ancestors of v and the depth of v is the number of edges on the path. The lowest common ancestor LCA(u, v) of two vertices u and v in a rooted tree is the unique vertex with maximum depth that is an ancestor of both u and v.

3 Strong kernels and hierarchies: In this section we introduce a restricted class of kernels that will later turn out to lead to valid optimal assignment kernels when employed as base kernel. We provide two different character
