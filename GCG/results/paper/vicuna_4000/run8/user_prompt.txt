Abstract: Research on storytelling over the last 100 years has distinguished at least two levels of narrative representation (1) story, or fabula; and (2) discourse, or sujhet. We use this distinction to create Fabula Tales, a computational framework for a virtual storyteller that can tell the same story in different ways through the implementation of general narratological variations, such as varying direct vs. indirect speech, character voice (style), point of view, and focalization. A strength of our computational framework is that it is based on very general methods for re-using existing story content, either from fables or from personal narratives collected from blogs. We first explain how a simple annotation tool allows naı́ve annotators to easily create a deep representation of fabula called a story intention graph, and show how we use this representation to generate story tellings automatically. Then we present results of two studies testing our narratological parameters, and showing that different tellings affect the reader’s perception of the story and characters.

1 Introduction: Research on oral storytelling over the last 100 years has distinguished at least two levels of narrative representation (1) story, or fabula: the content of a narrative in terms of the sequence of events and relations between them, the story characters and their traits and affects, and the properties and settings; and (2) discourse, or sujhet: the actual expressive telling of a story as a stream of words, gestures, images or facial expressions in a storytelling medium [2,22,7,19,20]. In the telling of a narrative, events from the story are selected, ordered, and expressed in the discourse. We use this distinction to create Fabula Tales, a computational framework for a virtual storyteller that can tell the same story in different ways, using a set of general narratological variations, such as direct vs. indirect speech, character voice (style), point of view, and focalization.
We demonstrate the generality of our methods by applying them to both Aesop’s Fables and personal narratives from a pre-existing corpus of blogs [8]. We hypothesize many advantages for a virtual storyteller who can repurpose existing stories. Stories such as The Startled Squirrel in Fig. 1 are created daily in the thousands and cover any topic imaginable. They are natural and personal, and may be funny, sad, heart-warming or serious. Applications for virtual storytellers who can retell these stories in different ways could include virtual companions, persuasion, educational storytelling, or sharing troubles in therapeutic settings [3,24,18,9,23]. Fig. 2 shows how Fabula Tales can shift from third person to first person automatically using content from The Startled Squirrel ar X

(Fig.1). To our knowledge, this is the first time that these narratological variations have been implemented in a framework where the discourse (telling) is completely independent of the fabula (content) of the story [13].
Sec. 2 describes how the deep structure of any narrative can be represented as a story intention graph, a generic model of the fabula [5]. Sec. 3 describes our method for generating retellings of stories, and Sec. 4 describes two experimental evaluations. We delay discussion of related work to Sec. 5 when we can compare it to our own, and sum up and discuss future work.

2 Repurposing Stories with Story Intention Graphs: Our framework builds on Elson’s representation of fabula, called a story intention graph, or SIG [5]. The SIG allows many aspects of a story to be captured, including key entities, events and statives arranged in a timeline, and an interpretation of the overarching goals, plans and beliefs of the story’s agents [5]. Fig. 4 shows the part of the SIG for The Startled Squirrel story in Fig. 1. Elson’s DRAMABANK provides 36 Aesop’s Fables encoded as SIGs, e.g. The Fox and the Crow in Fig. 3, and Elson’s annotation tool Scheherazade allows minimally trained annotators to develop a SIG for any narrative. We hired an undergraduate linguist to use Scheherezade to produce SIGs for 100 personal narratives. Each story took on average 45 minutes to annotate. We currently have 100 annotated stories on topics such as travel, daily activities, storms, gardening, funerals, going to the doctor, camping, and snorkeling.
Scheherazade allows users to annotate a story along several dimensions, starting with the surface form, or discourse as shown in Fig. 4, and then proceeding to deeper representations. The second column in Fig. 4 is called the “timeline layer”, in which the story facts are encoded as predicate-argument structures (propositions) and temporally ordered on a timeline. The timeline layer consists of a network of proposi-
tional structures, where nodes correspond to lexical items that are linked by thematic relations. Scheherazade adapts information about predicate-argument structures from the VerbNet lexical database [11] and uses WordNet [6] as its noun and adjectives taxonomy. The arcs of the story graph are labeled with discourse relations. Scheherazade also comes with a built-in realizer (referred to as sch in this paper) that the annotator can use to check their work. This realizer does not incorporate any narratological variations.

3 Generating Narratological Variations: Our framework can generate story re-tellings using methods that are neither genre nor domain-specific. We build Fabula Tales on two tools from previous work: PERSONAGE and the ES-Translator [15,21]. PERSONAGE is an expressive natural language generation engine that takes as input the syntactic formalism of Deep Syntactic Structures (DSYNTS) [12,10]. DSYNTS allow PERSONAGE to be flexible in generation, however the creation of DSYNTS has been hand crafted and time consuming. The ES-Translator (EST) automatically bridges the narrative representation of the SIG to the DSYNTS formalism by applying a model of syntax to the SIG [21]. The SIG representation gives us direct access to the linguistic and logical representations of the fabula for each story, so the EST can interpret the story in the DSYNTS formalism and retell it using different words or syntactic structures [21,14].
DSYNTS are dependency structures where the nodes are labeled with lexemes and the arcs of the tree are labeled with syntactic relations. The DSYNTS formalism distinguishes between arguments and modifiers and between argument types (subject, direct and indirect object etc). PERSONAGE handles morphology, agreement and function words to produce an output string.
After the EST applies syntax to the SIG, it generates two data structures: text plans containing sentence plans and the corresponding DSYNTS. Thus any story or content represented as a SIG can be retold using PERSONAGE. Fig. 5 provides a high level view of the architecture of EST. The full translation methodology is described in [21].
This paper incorporates the EST pipeline (including SIGs and PERSONAGE) into the Fabula Tales computational framework and adds three narratological parameters into story generation:
1. Point of View: change the narration point of view to any character in a story in the first person voice (Sec. 3.1.) 2. Direct Speech: given any SIG encoding that uses speech act verbs (e.g. said, told, asked, alleged), re-tell as direct speech or indirect speech (Sec. 3.2.) 3. Character Voice: Substitute different character voices using any character model expressible with PERSONAGE’s 67 parameters (Sec. 3.3.)
Fig. 6 provides variations that combine these narratological parameters illustrating content from “The Fox and the Crow” and two additional stories: Conflict at Work, and The Embarrassed Teacher. B2 and C1 are examples of the original tellings and C2 is a sch realization.

3.1 Point of View: From the deep syntactic structure in the format of DSYNTS, we can change the narration style from the third person perspective to the first person perspective of any character in the story (see example A4 in Fig. 6). We define simple rules to
