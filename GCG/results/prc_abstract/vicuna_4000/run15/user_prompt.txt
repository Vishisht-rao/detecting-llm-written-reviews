Abstract: Objective  Following guidance on data sharing from the 
International Committee of Medical Journal Editors,1 Takeda  
requires the inclusion of a data sharing statement in most 
manuscripts reporting results from interventional clinical 
trials. The standard version of this statement indicates that 
deidentified patient data will be made available within 3 
months to researchers who provide a methodologically sound 
proposal. The implementation of this policy for data sharing 
by request was assessed by reviewing published articles to determine whether a data sharing statement was included, 
modified, or not included, and the reason(s) for not sharing 
data were identified.
Design  To identify articles for inclusion in this study, an 
internal publication management system was used. Articles 
published online between July 2020 and November 2021 
reporting primary or secondary analyses from clinical trials 
sponsored by Takeda and reviewed by an internal clinical trial 
transparency (CTT) team were included in this analysis. Each 
article was assigned to 1 of the following categories: inclusion 
of standard data sharing statement, inclusion of modified 
data sharing statement, statement indicating there is no plan 
to share data, or no data sharing statement.
Results  A total of 36 interventional clinical trial manuscripts 
reviewed by the CTT team were included in the analysis. Of 
these, 26 (72%) included a statement outlining data 
availability: 11 (31%) used the recommended standard data 
sharing statement as outlined in the internal policy, while 15 
(42%) contained a modified statement on data availability, 
ranging from minor editorial amendments (generally 
consistent with the standard statement) to substantial 
differences in wording (due to specific journal requirements) 
(Figure 24 ). Only 2 articles (6%) contained a statement 
indicating that there was no plan to share the data—both were 
reporting results from rare disease studies involving very 
small numbers of patients, and the reason was concern 
regarding the risk of patient reidentification due to the 
number of patients. No data sharing statement was included 
in 8 articles (22%) for various reasons ( Figure 24 ). Of the 
journals that published articles without a data sharing 
statement, 3 had policies requiring inclusion of a data sharing 
statement, while the others had policies allowing and/or 
encouraging inclusion of a data sharing statement.
Conclusions  Sharing underlying data sets of published 
studies is important to promote transparency and facilitate 
new research. Following the adoption of a standardized 
approach to data sharing by request, most interventional 
clinical trial articles in this analysis contained a data sharing 
statement. In a few cases (n = 2), the statement indicated that No. of articles0 2 1 4 3 6 5Collaborative study
