Abstract: Objective The International Committee of Medical Journal 
Editors (ICMJE) provided a set of minimum criteria for 
authorship.1 These recommendations have been adapted for 
all sciences in an article by McNutt and colleagues.2 The main 
difference between these 2 sets of recommendations is that 
the science-wide recommendations do not require authors to 
draft or revise the work.1,2 This study aimed to identify the 
proportion of authors who, based on their self-compiled 
Contributor Role Taxonomy (CRediT) statements, did not 
meet the minimum criteria for authorship (ie, were honorary 
authors) according to these 2 sets of recommendations. 
Furthermore, the study aimed to identify the proportion of 
authors who supplied only resources and/or funding to a 
study. Such authors were identified as “supply authors,” and 
this practice is considered to be a subtype of honorary 
authorship.
Design Cross-sectional study of CRediT statements 
published in scholarly articles. The Public Library of Science 
(PLOS) provided CRediT statements and associated data for 
authors of articles published in PLOS journals between July 
2017 and October 2021. Two investigators independently 
evaluated the authorship recommendations1,2 and developed 
logical operations of CRediT items for each recommendation. 
A third investigator acted as an arbiter in case of 
disagreement. The criteria related to approval and 
accountability for both recommendations could not be 
verified because of current CRediT items. For the second 
objective of the study, authors who contributed only to roles 
funding acquisition and/or resources were identified.
Results A total of  629,046 CRediT statements (1 per author) 
originating from 82,683 journal articles were included.  Of the 
CRediT statements, 34.8% (n = 218,563; 95% CI, 34.7%-
34.9%) indicated that the contributions provided by the 
author were not sufficient to qualify for authorship according 
to the ICMJE recommendations. Based on science-wide 
recommendations, 3.6% (n = 22,575; 95% CI, 3.5%-3.6%) of 
the authors did not qualify for authorship. Sensitivity 
analyses accounting for potentially ambiguous CRediT items provided similar results. The odds of fulfilling only 1 of the 
recommendations steadily decreased from 2017 to 2021 
(Table 1 ), and authors of articles published in nonmedical 
journals had 1.11 times the odds to fulfill only 1 of the 
recommendations compared with authors of articles 
published in medical journals. Overall, 8394 authors (1.33%; 
95% CI, 1.31%-1.36%) were “supply authors.” Their 
prevalence decreased in the years from 2017 to 2019 
(difference in proportion, 0.6%; 95% CI, 0.57%-0.63%) but 
remained unchanged from 2019 to 2021 (0%; 95% CI, 
−0.02% to 0.02%).
Conclusions  Based on self-compiled CRediT statements, 
honorary authorship is still prevalent in science, although it 
seems to have steadily decreased in recent years. A seemingly 
minor edit applied to the ICMJE recommendations resulted 
in substantially different authorship requirements. Efforts 
should be directed toward developing consensus on core tasks 
to qualify for authorship that are widely applicable in science. 
Additional strategies should be implemented to address 
“supply authorship.”Plenary Session Abstracts

between recommendations as the dependent variable and year and journal area as 
independent categorical variables. For all comparisons, P < .001.
b For analytical purposes, journals that had medicine as one of their subject areas on the 
Scimago Journal Rank were classified as medical, whereas other journals were classified 
as nonmedical.
