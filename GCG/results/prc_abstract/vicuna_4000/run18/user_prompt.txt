Write a review for the following abstract.

Abstract: Objective  As gatekeepers for knowledge production, editors 
use their backgrounds to determine what counts as high-
quality research, how research should be done, and whether it 
offers novel insights. Individuals who come from racialized 
backgrounds are often excluded from these conversations, 
ensuring the publishing world continues to be led by the 
perspectives of the dominant racial group.1 To address this 
issue, the journal Teaching and Learning in Medicine (TLM)  
created an internship program for early career scholars who 
self-identified as Black, Latinx, or Indigenous to gain 
experience in the publishing/editorial process.2 The purpose 
of this study was to critically examine the outcomes of the 
first 6 months and investigate its implications for other 
journals interested in similar efforts.
Design  A collaborative autoethnographical study was 
designed to collectively analyze the program. Editorial staff 
and interns reflected on their lived experiences participating 
in the internship to understand the current culture of 
academic publishing and explore how to improve.3 Data 
sources included archival emails and program planning 
documents, focus group data, and group exercises. After 
transcribing the focus groups, data were analyzed using Table 78. COI Declared by Authors and Open Sources vs

Results  Focus group data indicated that while TLM designed 
the program with antiracist intent, mentors did not 
foreground their race in the editorial/publishing process 
outside of the intern’s minoritized status as a program 
selection criterion. Early on, mentors viewed the internship 
more as an opportunity to improve the journal’s editorial 
work, for participants to gain experience working in a 
historically guarded space, and to contribute to achieving 
racial equity in medical education. Therefore, despite the 
program’s specific antiracist focus, 6 months in, none of the 
mentors (who identified as White individuals) had explicitly 
discussed topics of race with their interns. Mentors’ reasons 
for not discussing race varied, including uncertainty about 
how to invite interns into such a discussion and not seeing 
interns as racialized individuals. However, at the end of the 
6 months, researchers realized the need to discuss this topic, 
thus moving the program into explicit conversations about 
race and the role it plays in publishing.
Conclusions  Although the program met some antiracist 
goals, stakeholders did not explicitly discuss the role that race 
plays in the review process, therefore limiting the program’s 
initial impact. Through this collaborative autoethnography, 
TLM  stakeholders  critically reflected on the program in real 
time and addressed this gap. In doing so, they engaged in the 
ongoing critical action needed to support equity within the 
editorial process. Editorial staff at TLM  now have the 
opportunity to address ongoing power dynamics between 
interns and staff members that will advance the journal’s 
efforts at antiracism. Plans are currently underway to ensure 
interns’ experiences are incorporated.

Editorial Decisions at eLife

Objective  Editorial decisions can depend on factors, like the 
timing of submissions or the matching of editors and 
reviewers, that are independent of the quality of the work. 
This analysis investigates associations of these and other 
external factors with editorial outcomes at eLife , a major 
biomedical journal.
Design  This study analyzed whether timing of submission 
(weekend vs weekday) was associated with the decision to 
send manuscripts for external review among senior editors, 
who can desk-reject submissions; compared peer review 
manuscript ratings by reviewer volume; and assessed whether 
submission time of month or year, preceding decisions to 
reject or review a manuscript, and matching of reviewer to 
manuscript specialty influenced editorial decisions. Data were 
analyzed by single variable regression.
Results  Between January 2016 and December 2018 eLife  
received 23,190 total submissions, 6498 of which were sent 
for review. Among senior editors (n = 65), proportions of 
manuscripts sent for external review ranged from 9.6% to 
49.3% and were statistically significantly lower on weekends 
(mean, 24% [SD, 1.3%]) than on weekdays (mean, 29% [SD, 
0.6%]; P < .001), an association observed for most senior 
editors. Average peer reviewer rating (range, 0-1) increased
