Abstract: Objective Living systematic reviews (LSRs) are systematic 
reviews that are constantly updated to incorporate new 
evidence once it becomes available.1 The aim of this study was 
to assess the frequency of updates to LSRs and the influence 
of COVID-19 on updates.
Design A cohort study of all LSRs indexed in PubMed, from 
inception to 2020, was performed, which were followed up 
until 2021. A PubMed search was conducted on September 
2021 using the term living systematic review  to retrieve 
articles published until December 31, 2020. Only the first 
version of the LSR was considered; protocols, conceptual 
papers, and other types of research were excluded. In January 
2022, updates of included LSRs until December 31, 2021, 
were searched; the 2020 Journal Impact Factor (JIF) was 
collected from Journal Citation Reports; the open-access 
status of the articles (if publicly available in full text or not) 
was checked; and the LSR subject (COVID-19 or not) was 
assessed. The number of months from publication of the 
original LSR to its first update stratified by COVID-19 subject 
was calculated and a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was 
performed. Regression analysis using Cox proportional hazards models was conducted to calculate the hazard ratios 
(HRs) with 95% CIs adjusted by JIF and open-access status to 
minimize potential confounding.
Results  Of 104 reports retrieved, 52 were original LSRs and 
were included in the study. Most LSRs were published in 
2020 (33 of 52), and 19 were published between 2004 and 
2019. Most articles were open access (50 of 52) and half had 
COVID-19 as the subject (28 of 52). As of December 31, 2021, 
a total of 60% (31 of 52) of the LSRs had been updated, taking 
a mean (SD) of 14 (3) months for the first update; 21 LSRs 
were not updated after a mean (SD) of 25 (4) months of 
publication. LSRs about COVID-19 were updated faster (n = 
28; mean [SD], 9 [1] months) than LSRs about other subjects 
(n = 24; mean [SD], 30 [4] months; Figure 7 ). COVID-19 
subject (HR, 3.64 [95% CI, 1.38-9.63]; P = .009) and higher 
JIF (HR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.05-1.17]; P < .001) were associated 
with a higher probability of updating LSRs over time, while 
open-access status had no association with LSR updates (HR, 
1.27 [95% CI, 0.16-10.25]; P = .82). 
Conclusions This study identified a limited number of LSRs 
(52), and 60% of them were updated in about 1 year. Nearly 2 
dozen were never updated despite having been published for 
2 years, on average; future research may assess the reasons 
involved. The rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic and 
available research potentially favored more updated LSRs. 
LSRs published in high-impact journals were also more likely 
to be updated.
