Abstract: Objective  The COVID-19 pandemic introduced a surge in 
the dissemination of preprints due to demand for faster and 
wider access to scientific knowledge. However, questions 
were raised concerning the reliability of their results.1,2 The 
aim of this study was to compare numerical results extracted 
from preprints vs related peer-reviewed publications to 
inform inclusion in living systematic reviews.
Design This cross-sectional study used data from the 
COVID-NMA (covid-nma.com) initiative, a living systematic 
review of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating 
preventive interventions, treatments, and vaccines for 
COVID-19. Pharmacological treatment RCTs originally posted 
as preprints and subsequently published in peer-reviewed 
journals were included. Trials that moved from interim to 
final analysis between sources were excluded. Effect size 
estimates extracted from the first preprint were compared 
with effect size estimates from the most recent peer-reviewed 
publication. Predefined COVID-NMA “critical outcomes” at 
28 days3 were considered (ie, clinical improvement, World 
Health Organization Clinical Progression Score level 7 or 
above, all-cause mortality, incidence of any adverse events, 
incidence of serious adverse events). The last search date was 
February 3, 2022.
Results A total of 425 RCTs were identified. Trials only 
available as peer-reviewed publications (n = 217 [51%]), 
preprints (n = 85 [20%]), and unpublished (n = 16 [4%]) were 
excluded, as well as trials reporting interim to final analysis 
between sources (n = 11 [3%]), no review-specific outcomes (n 
= 4 [1%]), and nonpharmacological treatments (n = 3 [1%]). 
Eighty-nine RCTs (230 outcomes) first available as preprints 
and subsequently as peer-reviewed publications were 
included. The median delay between preprint post and 
subsequent publication in a peer-reviewed journal was 112 
days (range, 5-505 days). Seventy-two (81%) preprint-
publication RCTs (168 outcomes) showed no discrepancies in 
outcomes reported. Eight (9%) RCTs had numerical 
discrepancies in 15 of the 22 outcomes reported in both 
sources; no change in the direction of effect size estimate 
between sources was found ( Figure 8 ). Of these, 1 RCT also 
had 2 outcomes added in the peer-reviewed publication. 
Furthermore, in trials with no numerical discrepancies in 
outcomes reported, 1 (1%) RCT had 2 outcomes missing in the 
peer-reviewed publication and 8 (9%) RCTs had at least 1 
outcome added in the peer-reviewed publication compared 
with the preprint.
Conclusions Numerical results were generally similar 
between COVID-19 preprints and related peer-reviewed 
publications in the majority of RCTs. However, some 
outcomes were added and deleted. We could not assess 
whether preprint trials that were never published as peer-
reviewed articles were problematic and whether peer review prevented journal publication due to unsupported 
conclusions.
