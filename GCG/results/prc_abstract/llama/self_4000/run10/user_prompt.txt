Write a review for the following abstract.

Abstract: Objective Geographical disparities have been observed in 
the acquisition of research grants and in the submission and 
publication of research articles. Peer reviewers are selected 
primarily based on their expertise through publication 
records. Response to peer invitation has been shown to be 
related to relevance of topic to own work, reviewer 
availability, journal attributes (impact factor and type of 
reviewer blinding) and compensation.1,2 However, diversity in 
terms of geographical distribution in response to peer 
invitations remains almost unexplored.3
Design Retrospective  cohort study of all research 
manuscripts submitted to 21 BMJ Publishing Group 
biomedical journals between January 1, 2018, and May 31, 
2021, and subsequently sent for review. Data were collected 
on geographical affiliation, income level of the country of 
affiliation (according to World Bank Data 2020), journal 
impact factor, and peer-review process (open vs anonymized). 
The primary outcome was response (agreed vs not agreed) to 
review invitation. A multivariable mixed-effects logistic 
regression model with random factors on the inte rcept at 
journal and manuscript levels was performed.
Results A total of 257,025 reviewers were invited to review 
and 90,467 (35.2%) agreed. The distribution of geographical 
affiliations of the invited reviewers were as follows: 10.0% in 
Africa, 8.8% in Asia, 47.6% in Europe, 26.0% in North Diversity

Among invited reviewers, 217,682 (84.7%) were affiliated 
with a high-income country. Figure 4  summarizes results 
from multivariable analysis. Agreement was higher among 
reviewers from Asia (2.13 [95% CI, 2.05-2.21]), Oceania (1.22 
[95% CI, 1.17-1.27]), or South America (2.24 [95% CI, 
2.06-2.45]) and lower among reviewers from Africa (0.43 
[95% CI, 0.42-0.45] compared with Europe ( P < .001). 
Agreement was significantly lower when the last author was 
from Asia (0.85 [95% CI, 0.83-0.87]) or Oceania (0.91 [95% 
CI, 0.87-0.95]) compared with Europe ( P < .001). Reviewers 
agreed significantly more often when the associated editor had a North American institutional affiliation compared with 
a European affiliation (1.07 [95% CI, 1.02-1.12]). Compared 
with high-income countries, agreement was higher among 
reviewers from lower middle–income countries (3.26 [95% 
CI, 3.06-3.48]) and low-income countries (2.99 [95% CI, 
2.57-3.48]) ( P < .001). Agreement was also lower when the 
last author was from an upper middle–income country (0.94 
[95% CI, 0.91-0.98]) or low-income country (0.88 [95% CI, 
0.81-0.96]) compared with a high-income country ( P < .001). 
Agreement was associated with impact factor (higher for 
impact factors between 5 and 10, or >10, compared with <5:

Conclusions The geographical affiliation of reviewers was 
an independent factor associated with agreement to review. 
To avoid bias and increase diversity, journal editors need to 
invite more reviewers from upper middle–income or low-
income countries.
