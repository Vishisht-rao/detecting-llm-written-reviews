Write a review for the following abstract.

Abstract: Objective  How medical journal audiences read scientific 
articles is of key interest to authors and editors, but there are 
few publications on reading patterns. To better understand 
reading behavior, surveys of readers of a print general 
medical journal conducted with physicians in private practice 
were analyzed, with a focus on reading rates, popularity of 
different kinds of articles, attraction of tables or figures, and 
how readership declined with increasing numbers of pages in 
an article.
Design  This was a survey study of readers of Deutsches 
Ärzteblatt , the journal of the German Medical Association 
and the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance 
Physicians. During regular surveys between 2000 and 2019, 
changing groups of general practitioners and internists in 
private practice marked pages they had read in a print journal Table 30. Responsibilities of Data Recipients to Data Providers

86     Peer Review Congressissue. Here, we present results from 57 survey waves. Using 
multivariable logistic regression, associations of formal page 
characteristics (independent variables: right vs left page, first 
vs following page within an article, presence of tables or text 
boxes, publication year) with reading status of a page 
(dependent variable: yes/no) were analyzed.
Results  The median number of participants per survey wave 
was 49 (IQR, 35-77), the mean age across groups was 54 
years, and a total of 1104 pages were surveyed. In all waves 
combined, the median readership per page was 14.1% (IQR, 
6.7%-25.0%), with no trend across the 20 years covered. For 
full-length articles, the mean (SD) readership peaked at page 
1 at 38.7% (11.5%), decreased to 12.3% (8.7%) at page 2, and 
plateaued at approximately 12% for pages 3 to 7 ( Figure 18 ). 
Reference lists were read less frequently (median, 0% [IQR, 
0%-1.6%]). Pages with tables were marked more often than 
those without (median, 12.5% [IQR, 6.3%-20.1%]), less so for 
pages with figures (median, 9.4% [IQR, 4.5%-17.6%]). 
Readers more often read right than left pages, but after 
removing first pages from the analysis, the difference 
narrowed (median, 11.3% [IQR, 5.6%-21.2%] vs median, 
10.1% [IQR, 5.0%-17.4%]). On multivariable analysis, reading 
status was independently associated with first pages (OR, 
4.70 [95% CI, 4.10-5.38]), right pages (OR, 1.14 [95% CI, 
1.04-1.25]), and presence of tables or text boxes (OR, 1.32 
[95% CI, 1.16-1.49]). Physicians more often read review 
articles (median, 17.0% [IQR, 12.3%-24.0%]) than original 
articles (median, 12.5% [IQR, 10.0%-15.8%]) and letters 
(median, 11.7% [IQR, 7.8-16.5%]) and read editorials most 
frequently (median, 29.5% [IQR, 18.8%-34.0%]). By topic, 
the median (IQR) readership was 18.6% (7.8%-26.9%) for 
nonsurgery topics (eg, internal medicine, neurology, 
psychiatry), 12.7% (6.0%-24.1%) for surgery topics (eg, 
traumatology), and 8.1% (3.1%-15.4%) for cross-disciplinary 
topics (eg, radiology, microbiology).
Conclusions  In this study, readership of medical journal 
articles dropped by two-thirds after page 1 but remained 
relatively stable thereafter, and approximately 1 in 8 readers read an entire full-length article. These results apply to 
primary care physicians and are not representative of the 
entire audience of a general medical journal.
