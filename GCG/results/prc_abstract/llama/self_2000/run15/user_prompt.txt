Write a review for the following abstract.

Abstract: Objective Medical journals often use visual abstracts (VAs), 
“infographics” designed to graphically convey a study’s 
research question, methods, findings, and conclusions, to 
summarize and promote published research on social media. 
Studies suggest that VAs increase an article’s reach and 
engagement, mostly demonstrated for individual journals on 
Twitter.1-3 The JAMA Network, a family of 2 general medical 
and 11 specialty journals, began creating VAs for randomized 
clinical trials (RCTs) in 2018-2020 and publishing them 
online and in social media. This study examined the association of VAs with social media–driven site traffic and 
metrics.
Design This random-sequence simultaneous crossover trial  
included all RCTs published in the 13 JAMA Network journals 
with an accompanying VA between September 21, 2021, and 
May 15, 2022. For each, tweets and Facebook posts 
promoting the RCT were published including a standard text 
summary with a link to the online article, accompanied by 3 
image display types: (1) preview VA, a VA thumbnail that 
linked to the article when clicked; (2) expandable VA, a VA 
thumbnail that expanded to full screen when clicked; and (3) 
article image, an article figure or table thumbnail that linked 
to the article (Facebook) or expanded to full screen (Twitter) 
when clicked (control display). Three tweets and 3 Facebook 
posts, 1 with each image display type, were published to 
Twitter and Facebook nearly simultaneously (1 minute apart) 
in random sequence within an hour of article publication. The 
primary outcome was the number of link clicks by image 
display type at 1 week. Secondary outcomes were social media 
Twitter impressions/Facebook reach (how many times people 
saw the tweet or post) and engagement (sum total number of 
comments/replies, shares by other users, and likes) by image 
display type at 1 week. The study was designed to provide 
80% power to detect a 50% increase in median link clicks 
comparing either of the 2 VA formats vs article image display.
Results  Among 205 JAMA Network RCTs with VAs, link 
clicks to full-text articles were higher with preview VAs vs 
article images; impressions/reach and engagement were 
higher with expandable VAs vs article image displays 
(Table 24 ). In a preplanned subgroup analysis, the higher 
link clicks appeared attributable to preview VA display on 
Twitter (preview VA median, 12 [IQR, 3-41] and expandable

a Health and life sciences included pharmacology and toxicology, clinical medicine, immunology, microbiology, biology and biochemistry, plant and animal science, environment and ecology, 
agricultural sciences, neuroscience and behavior, molecular biology and genetics, and psychiatry and psychology. Multidisciplinary included multidisciplinary journals: physical sciences, 
space science, physics, chemistry, geosciences, engineering, materials science. Formal sciences included mathematics, computer science. Social sciences included general social sciences, 
economics and business.
b Some journals offered multiple types of postpublication critique. Consequently, the number of journals offering letters, commentaries, or web comments does not sum to the number of journals 
offering any postpublication critique.

Conclusions In this random-sequence simultaneous 
crossover trial , the use of visual abstracts in social media 
posts was associated with higher social media–driven journal 
site traffic when displayed as preview links, and higher social 
media reach and engagement when displayed as expandable 
images, compared with article images.
