Abstract: Objective  In May 2020, Pediatrics  moved to a new author 
submission platform that allows authors to choose single-
anonymous (SA) or double-anonymous (DA) peer review.1 
Prior to May 2020, SA reviewing was the only option. The 
purpose of this study was to describe author characteristics 
associated with choosing SA vs DA peer review.  We tested 3 
hypotheses: ( 1) corresponding authors who are women are 
more likely to select DA peer review than those who are men, 
(2) corresponding authors who are junior faculty (ie, assistant 
professors, instructors, or trainees) are more likely to select 
DA peer review than faculty at higher academic ranks (ie, 
associate professor or professors), and (3) corresponding 
authors who select DA peer review are more likely to have 
their manuscript rejected than those who select SA peer 
review given that knowledge of a well-respected author by the 
reviewer may preferentially bias the reviewer favorably.
Design  In this cross-sectional study, we classified Pediatrics 
articles (submitted between May 4, 2020, and April 1, 2021) by peer review type and then randomly sampled 150 articles 
of each type. After excluding sampled articles that were not 
“regular studies” and others without a US-based author, 169 
regular research articles (73 SA and 96 DA peer review) 
remained. Corresponding author gender and academic rank 
were determined manually using an internet search. We 
tested our hypotheses using χ² tests and χ² tests for trend.
Results  Of the 2720 regular articles submitted to the journal 
during the study period, 505 (18.6%) were submitted for DA 
peer review. We found no difference in the proportion of 
corresponding authors who chose DA peer review by gender 
(62% men vs 53% women; P = .24). There was no statistically 
significant difference in the likelihood of choosing DA peer 
review with increasingly higher academic rank (χ² test for 
trend, P = .20). The likelihood of rejection was somewhat 
higher for DA vs SA peer review; however, this difference was 
not significant (94.8% vs 86.3%; P = .06).
Conclusions  US-based author preference for DA peer 
review in Pediatrics was not associated with gender or faculty 
rank. Given that nearly 1 in 5 authors submitting to Pediatrics  
preferred DA peer review, both options will continue to be 
offered.
