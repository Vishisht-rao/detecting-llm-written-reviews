Abstract: Objective  To examine concordance between peer reviewers’ 
recommendations and editorial decisions for a general 
pediatric journal.
Design  This was a cross-sectional observational study of a 
convenience sample of peer-review recommendations for 
articles submitted to The Journal of Pediatrics  reported using 
the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in 
Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline . After 
submission, an editor made a preliminary assessment and 
invited peer reviewers. Responding reviewers were asked to 
provide a recommendation for acceptance, revision, or 
rejection. When recommending acceptance or revision, 
reviewers were asked to select a priority score for publication 
on a 4-level Likert scale (low, medium low, medium high, 
high). After assessing the reviews, editors decided either to 
move the article forward (accept or invite a revision) or to 
reject. Manuscripts were included in the study if the original 
submission was initially reviewed by at least 2 invited 
reviewers. The primary outcome of the study was the final 
disposition (accept or reject). Reviewer recommendations 
and Likert scores in response to the original submission were 
compared with final dispositions using univariable and 
multivariable regression. For the multivariable analysis, the 
highest reviewer priority score was dichotomized as high/
medium high vs. medium low/low. Differences between 
priority scores were dichotomized as matched or differing by 
1 Likert level vs differing by 2 or 3 Likert levels.
Results  The sample included 1016 articles sent for review 
between June 16, 2020, and October 27, 2021, with at least 2 
completed reviews in response to the original submission. At 
least 1 reviewer recommended rejection for 393 of 1016 
manuscripts (38.7%). When reviewers agreed to reject, all 
manuscripts were rejected (65 of 65); however, when 
reviewers disagreed on rejection, 36 of 328 manuscripts were 
accepted for publication (11%; P = .005) and 1 is pending to 
date. Among articles with a reviewer recommendation for 
rejection and at least 1 reviewer priority score (n=294), high 
or medium high priority scores were associated with a final 
decision to accept the article (odds ratio [OR],11.37; 95% CI, 
3.94-32.85; P < .001). Reviewers agreed to move the article 
forward for 623 of 1016 manuscripts (61.3%) with 395 
ultimately accepted for publication. Of these 623, 494 (79.3%) 
had at least 2 reviewer priority scores and a final disposition. 
The highest reviewer priority score was significantly 
associated with the acceptance rate ( Table 34 ). In 
multivariable regression, higher priority score category (OR, 
12.59; 95% CI, 6.84-23.14) and level of reviewer agreement 
on priority scores (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.15-3.6) were both 
significantly associated with article acceptance rates.
Conclusions  Both reviewer recommendations on 
acceptance or rejection and priority scores for publication 
appeared to be influential in editorial decision-making. 
However, editors were frequently required to arbitrate mixed 
reviewer recommendations and make independent decisions.
