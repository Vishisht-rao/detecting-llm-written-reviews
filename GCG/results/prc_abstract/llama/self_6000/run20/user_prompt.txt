Write a review for the following abstract.

Abstract: Objective Reporting guidelines have been available since 
1994. Numerous studies have shown that adherence to 
reporting guidelines is suboptimal,1,2 raising the question of 
whether a specific targeted intervention for peer reviewers 
might improve reporting. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate whether asking peer reviewers, via email, to check if 
specific reporting guideline items were adequately reported in 
the submitted manuscripts they were reviewing would 
improve adherence to reporting guidelines in published 
articles.
Design  Two parallel-group superiority randomized 
controlled trials (RCT-1 and RCT-2) using submitted 
manuscripts as the unit of randomization. RCT-1 focused on 
RCT protocols and how well they were reported considering 
the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for 
Interventional Trials) guidelines, and RCT-2 focused on RCT 
results publications and the reporting of CONSORT 
(Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) items. 
Manuscripts in both RCTs were randomized (1:1) to 
intervention or control; the control group received usual 
journal practice. RCT-1 included manuscripts containing RCT 
protocols submitted from June 2020 to May 2021 to BMJ 
Open  that were sent for peer review  (https://osf.io/z2hm9). 
The RCT-2 trial3 included manuscripts describing RCT 
primary results, submitted from July 2019 to July 2021 to 1 of 
7 journals (5 BMJ Publishing Group; 2 Public Library of 
Science [PLOS]). In the intervention group (both trials), peer 
reviewers received an email from the journal reminding them 
to check if items were adequately reported in the manuscript. 
In RCT-1, these were the 10 most important and poorly 
reported SPIRIT items and for RCT-2, the 10 most important and poorly reported CONSORT items. In both RCTs, peer 
reviewers and authors were not informed of the purpose of 
the study and outcome assessors were blinded. The primary 
outcome was the difference in the mean proportion of 
adequately reported 10 SPIRIT and 10 CONSORT items 
between intervention and control in the final published 
article.
Results  In RCT-1, 245 manuscripts were randomized. Of 
those, 178 were published (90 intervention; 88 control). A 
mean proportion of 46.1% (95% CI, 41.8%-50.4%) of the 10 
SPIRIT items were adequately reported in the intervention 
group and 45.6% (95% CI, 41.7%-49.4%) in the control group 
(mean difference, 0.5%; 95% CI, −5.2% to 6.3%) ( Figure 10 ). 
In RCT-2, of the 511 randomized manuscripts, 243 were 
published (121 intervention; 122 control). A total of 67.4% 
(95% CI, 63.8%-71.1%) of the 10 CONSORT items were 
adequately reported in the intervention group and 65.9% 
(95% CI, 61.9%-69.9%) in the control group (mean difference, 
1.5%; 95% CI, −3.8% to 6.9%) ( Figure 10 ).
Conclusions  Journals asking peer reviewers, via email, to 
check if the most important and poorly reported items are 
adequately reported in submitted manuscripts did not 
improve the reporting completeness of the final published 
article.
