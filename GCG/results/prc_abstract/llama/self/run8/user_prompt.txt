Write a review for the following abstract.

Abstract: Objective  The Resident & Fellow Section (RFS) of 
Neurology  expanded and formalized a biannual virtual, 
mentored peer review training program in 2020. Similar to 
prior studies,1 qualitative data demonstrated that mentored 
peer review improved understanding of and confidence with 
independent review.2 The objective of the current study was 
to quantitatively evaluate review quality before and after a 
mentored peer review program for neurology residents and 
fellows.
Design  In this pre-post intervention study, faculty mentors 
chosen from a national pool of experienced reviewers with an 
interest in mentoring were paired with trainee peer reviewers. 
Mentees were selected from residents and fellows who 
responded to a call for program participants via American 
Academy of Neurology social media channels or who applied 
to the RFS editorial board. Mentees first completed 
unassisted reviews of a standardized manuscript. Participants –0.1 0 –0.05 –0.15 0.05 0.1 0.15

46     Peer Review Congressthen received structured resources on how to review a 
manuscript and construct written peer review. Mentor-
mentee dyads completed 2 reviews over 6 months. Mentees 
also completed unassisted postprogram reviews of a 
standardized manuscript. The association between program 
participation and peer review quality was quantitatively 
assessed by 3 independent evaluators scoring the preprogram 
and postprogram unassisted reviews using a modified version 
of the Review Quality Instrument (RQI)3 comprising 4 items 
scored present or absent (1 or 0) and 10 items scored on a 
5-point Likert scale for a maximum score of 55. Higher scores 
indicated better review quality. Evaluator scores were 
averaged for each participant, and a paired t test was used to 
compare preintervention and postintervention scores. P < .05 
was considered significant.
Results  A total of 20 mentor-mentee pairs, including 8 
incoming members of the RFS editorial board and 12 
neurology trainees, were enrolled over 2 sessions in 2021. 
Two mentees failed to complete the postprogram unassisted 
review and were excluded. Total modified RQI scores ranged 
from 15.67 to 39.00 before the program and 19.67 to 43.67 
after the program.
