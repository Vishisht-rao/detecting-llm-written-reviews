Write a review for the following abstract.

Abstract: Objective Many anecdotes suggest that including citations to 
the works of potential reviewers is a good (albeit unethical) 
way to increase the acceptance chances of a paper. However, 
previous attempts1,2 to quantify this effect (citation bias) had 
low sample sizes and unaccounted confounding factors, such 
as paper quality (stronger papers had longer bibliographies) 
or reviewer expertise (cited reviewers had higher expertise). 
In this work, the question of whether positive comments from 
reviewers are associated with their work being cited in the 
papers that they review was investigated.
Design The study used data from 2 top-tier computer science 
conferences: the 2021 Association for Computing Machinery 
Conference on Economics and Computation (EC) and 2020 
International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML). Both 
conferences received full-length papers that underwent 
rigorous review (similar to top journals in other areas). The 
study analyzed anonymized observational data, and consent 
collection was not required. The dependent variable of the 
analysis was the overall score given by a reviewer to a paper 
(between 1 and 5 in EC and 1 and 6 in ICML; higher meant 
better). To investigate the association between the citation of 
a reviewer and their score, parametric (linear regression for 
EC and ICML) and nonparametric (permutation test with 
covariate matching for ICML) tests at significance level α = 
.05 were combined, circumventing various confounding 
factors, such as paper quality, genuinely missing citations, 
reviewer expertise, reviewer seniority, and reviewers’ 
preferences in which papers to review. The approach 
comprised matching cited and uncited reviewers within each 
paper and then carefully analyzing the differences in their 
scores. In this way, the aforementioned paper quality 
confounder was alleviated as matched cited and uncited 
reviewers reviewed the same paper. Additionally, various 
attributes of reviewers (eg, their expertise in the paper’s 
research area) were used to account for confounders 
associated with the reviewer identity (eg, reviewer expertise). 
Finally, the genuinely missing citation confounder was 
accounted for by excluding papers in which an uncited 
reviewer genuinely decreased their evaluation of a paper 
because it failed to cite their own relevant past work.
Results Overall, 3 analyses were conducted, with sample 
sizes ranging from 60 to 1031 papers and from 120 to 2757 
reviewers’ evaluations. These analyses detected citation bias 
in both venues and indicated that citation of a reviewer was 
associated with an increase in their score (approximately 0.23 
point on a 5-point scale). For reference, a 1-point increase of a 
score by a single reviewer would improve the position of a 
paper by 11% on average.
Conclusions To improve peer review, it is important to 
understand the biases present and their magnitude. This

problem of mitigating the bias. The reader should be aware of 
the observational nature of this study when interpreting the 
results.
