Write a review for the following abstract.

Abstract: Objective  Despite strong in-principle support for the 
concept of data sharing for health research, in practice it is 
often difficult to find, access, and reuse data.1 In the absence 
of agreed-on global standards, this study sought to determine 
the responsibilities of recipients of health research data and 
propose how these responsibilities can be met.
Design A qualitative study involving an online focus group 
was conducted in December 2021 at the Association for 
Interdisciplinary Meta-research and Open Science (AIMOS) 
conference. All conference delegates were eligible to attend, 
and targeted invitations were sent to known data-sharing 
experts. The conference was open to all and offered free 
attendance. The focus group involved discussion of 3 case 
studies of different data-sharing scenarios in health research 
(an individual participant data meta-analysis, study 
replication, and secondary analyses) and a general discussion 
prompted by key questions. Participants contributed by 
speaking in the video call or by typing in real time on shared 
Google documents. Afterward, notes and recording 
transcripts were collated into categories using thematic 
analysis and shared with attendees for review and further 
input. Primary outcomes were the responsibilities of data 
recipients across the design, conduct, analyses, and reporting 
stages of their research. Secondary outcomes included how 
data providers may support data recipients to meet these 
responsibilities.
Results The 2-hour focus group discussion was attended by 
16 conference delegates (including 3 facilitators; 11 delegates 
agreed to coauthor this abstract). Although AIMOS is a 
multidisciplinary conference, most attendees had health 
care–related roles across various fields, including 
epidemiology, statistics, evidence synthesis, policy, ethics, 
public health, data management, oncology, psychology, 
nutrition, clinical trials, and administration. Most 
participants cited a university as their primary employer. 
www. peerreviewcongress.org     85Analyses revealed several recurring themes across the 
data-sharing scenarios, which were grouped into 
recommendations ( Table 30 ). Recommendations included 
that data recipients need to prioritize the protection of 
participant privacy and should proactively share a secure data 
management plan and evidence of ethical approval with the 
data provider. Additionally, data recipients should allay 
concerns about potential data misuse by demonstrating they 
have sufficient resources and expertise to process, check, and 
analyze data. They should also protect the interests of data 
providers by allowing them to publish their results before 
sharing data, offering streamlined data-sharing pathways, 
and inviting them to contribute to related outputs. Data 
providers could support recipients by planning for data 
sharing during study design, including funding support, local 
legislation, intellectual property, commercial-in-confidence 
information, and by preparing a data dictionary.
Conclusions This study provides clarity around 
responsibilities of data recipients to address common 
concerns of data providers on data misuse and privacy. 
Several recommendations were derived on how data 
providers can support recipients to bridge the gap between 
high support for data sharing and low in-practice compliance.Reference
