Abstract: Objective Cell Press Community Review was launched in 
September 2020 with 20 participating journals as a pilot for a 
new peer review model. This model aimed to increase the 
efficiency of peer review by reducing cycles of editorial 
rejection through simultaneous consideration at multiple 
journals of interest and by providing delineated options for 
revisions for each target journal based on a single set of 
reviews. This study evaluated the performance of Community 
Review compared with the traditional peer review model, in 
which manuscripts may undergo multiple rounds of editorial 
rejection and transfer, to determine if Community Review 
results in improvements in the rates of peer review and 
acceptance and in publication timeline.
Design Total submissions, peer review offers, papers 
reviewed, and papers accepted from September 2020 through 
May 2022 were compared between Community Review and 
direct submissions to participating journals. Publication 
timeline for submissions to Community Review (Community 
Review submission date to journal acceptance date) were 
compared with those of papers submitted directly to the 
participating journals, delineated by the number of editorial 
reject/transfer cycles (first journal submission date to final 
journal acceptance date). Additionally, surveys were sent 
between April 2022 and May 2022 to authors on submission 
(38 responses of 258 sent, 15% participation rate) for 
feedback on the Community Review model.
Results  Of 1674 total Community Review submissions, 1237 
(74%) were offered peer review at 1 or more participating 
journals. Of the 1237 offers, 579 were taken up by the authors 
(47% uptake of peer review offer; 35% of total submissions 
reviewed). Of 344 Community Review submissions with a 
final postreview outcome, 191 were accepted (56% postreview 
accept rate). In the same period, 13,615 of 41,638 unique 
manuscripts (33%) directly submitted to participating 
journals were sent for review, either at the original journal or 
following 1 or more cycles of editorial reject/transfer. Of 9966 
direct submissions with a final postreview outcome, 5689 
were accepted (57% postreview accept rate). The results of the 
publication timeline analysis are presented in Table 6 . Table 5. Main Issues Identified During the EDI Review Process
Factual errors or misrepresentation of facts regarding marginalized groups
Insufficient methodological specificity regarding the nature of how EDI variables 
were conceptualized and determined
Insufficient acknowledgment of study limitations regarding EDI-related issues
Nonaffirming assertions and descriptions of marginalized groups (including obso -
lete terminology and biased language)
“Framing” issues (eg, implying that race is a biological rather than social 
construct)
Terminology concerns (eg, confusing sex and gender, race and ethnicity)
Abbreviation: EDI indicates equity, diversity, and inclusion.
34     Peer Review CongressAuthor surveys indicated “consideration across a selection of 
high-quality journals” and “interest in concept” as the top 
reasons authors chose to submit to Community Review.
Conclusions The Community Review model resulted in a 
greater chance of receiving an offer for peer review compared 
with direct journal submission and a larger percentage of 
total submissions being reviewed. The publication timeline 
for Community Review was comparable to that for direct 
journal submissions that underwent at least 1 round of 
editorial reject/transfer. There was interest from the research 
community in the Community Review submission model, 
with authors expressing interest in this model for efficiency in 
being considered for multiple journals simultaneously.

Early Experiences of the Preprint Overlay 
Journal JMIRx
Gunther Eysenbach1
Objective  In 2019, JMIR Publications announced the 
creation of a new series of journals, which are called 
superjournals, with JMIRx-Med  the initial journal launched 
in that new journal series.1 
Superjournals are a type of overlay journal that sit on top of 
preprint servers, offering rapid peer review and formal 
publication of revised preprints.1
Design  An editorial prospecting platform (XDash) that 
invites preprint authors from medRxiv or bioRxiv was 
developed ( Figure 5 ). All authors received an online survey 
that asked about motivations on why they posted the 
preprint, plans to submit to a journal, and whether they 
would be interested in a peer review of their preprint. Authors 
of new preprints were contacted as soon as their preprints 
were posted; no reminders were sent. Only preprints that 
were not already under peer review at a journal were eligible 
for consideration for JMIRx . After the peer review process, all 
peer review reports, author responses, and revised and 
accepted preprints are published in a JMIRx  journal and 
deposited in PubMed Central/PubMed and institutional 
repositories of member institutions or, via the Manuscript eXchange Marketplace, offered to other journals for 
publication.
Results  Between December 19, 2019, and March 9, 2022, 
11,143 responses were received. In the same period, 113,724 
preprints were posted (response rate of 9.7%, although it is 
not known how many emails were actually extracted correctly 
and delivered). Forty-five percent of respondents (5011) 
submitted their manuscripts to a journal immediately after 
deposit as a preprint; for 1288 of respondents (11.6%), 
journals deposited a submitted manuscript on the preprint 
server on behalf of the authors. Together, these 2 groups 
represented 56.5% of respondents (n = 6299), whose preprint 
was already under peer review. The remaining 4844 
respondents (43.5%) had not submitted their preprint to a 
journal yet. A total of 869 (7.8%) had no plans to submit to a 
journal, 3409 preprint authors (30.6%) planned to submit the 
preprint to a journal, and 1976 (17.7%) expressed interest in a 
peer review. A total of 7676 authors (68.9%) also indicated 
they absolutely need to publish the preprint in a journal with 
an impact factor, and 6560 authors (58.9%) indicated they 
wanted their publication indexed in PubMed.
Conclusions  The JMIRx  concept is welcomed by some 
authors looking for a rapid publication venue.
