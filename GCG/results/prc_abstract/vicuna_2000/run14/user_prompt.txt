Write a review for the following abstract.

Abstract: Objective  Merton1 argued that “eminent scientists get 
disproportionately great credit for their contribution to 
science while relatively unknown scientists tend to get 
disproportionately little credit for comparable contributions.” 
In this context, this study asked (1) is there a status bias in 
reviewers’ propensity to accept review invitations? and (2) is 
there a status bias in their evaluation of the paper?Design A manuscript written by Vernon Smith (Nobel 
laureate, high prominence) and Sabiou Inoua (young 
researcher, low prominence) was submitted to the Journal of 
Behavioral and Experimental Finance  for peer review. The 
paper was assigned to 3299 reviewers randomized into 5 
conditions: (1) no author name in the invitation email or on 
the manuscript’s title page (treatment: AA; 576 reviewers); 
(2) high-prominence author name on manuscript only (AH; 
696); (3) low-prominence author name on manuscript only 
(AL; 739); (4) high-prominence author name on both email 
and manuscript (HH; 507); and (5) low-prominence author 
name on both email and manuscript (LL; 781). To avoid 
confounding, only 1 name was shown in the email and on the 
manuscript, and the author was always designated as the 
corresponding author. Reviewers gave consent to being part 
of the study prior to accessing the paper. Those who 
submitted a report were debriefed after the study. Reviewers’ 
decisions to accept the invitation in response to anonymized 
(AA, AH, AL) vs nonanonymized (LL, HH) emails were 
compared using Fisher exact tests. The distribution of 
publication recommendations (eg, reject, major revision, 
minor revision, or accept) was compared for manuscripts that 
showed the author’s name (AL, AH) vs those that did not 
(AA) using Mann-Whitney tests.
Results A total of 2611 researchers (79.1%) responded to the 
invitation, 821 of whom agreed to review (31.4%). The 
invitation showing Vernon Smith was accepted statistically 
significantly more often than those showing no author name 
or Sabiou Inoua (acceptances: HH, 158 of 410 [38.5%] vs LL, 
174 of 610 [28.5%]; P = .001; HH, 158 of 410 [38.5%] vs 
anonymized, 489 of 1591 [30.7%]; P = .003). Of the 821 
reviewers who accepted the invitation, 534 (65.0%) submitted 
reports (AA, 110; AL, 101; AH, 102; LL, 114; and HH, 107). 
The manuscript showing the prominent author received 
53.3% less reject recommendations and more than 10 times 
as many accept recommendations as the anonymized version 
(test on the distribution of recommendations: AH vs AA, 
P < .001) ( Table 11 , A). The manuscript showing the name of 
the less prominent author got 35.5% more reject 
recommendations and 63.7% less minor revision 
recommendations than the anonymized version (test on the 
distribution of recommendations: AL vs AA, P = .005) 
(Table 11 , B). Author prominence affected the willingness to 
review and reviewers’ recommendations.
Conclusions Although double-anonymized peer review is 
not a panacea,2 this study’s results still support its use in the 
field of finance.
