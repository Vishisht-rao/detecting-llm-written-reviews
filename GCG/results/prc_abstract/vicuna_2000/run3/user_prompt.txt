Write a review for the following abstract.

Abstract: Objective One of the changes to the peer review process 
introduced by open science is the participation of reviewers 
who were not selected by editors or not indicated by authors 
in the evaluation of the manuscripts submitted for 
publication. Previous studies characterizing open peer review 
and its traits have called this phenomenon “open 
participation,”1 “crowdsourced peer review,”2 and “public peer 
review.”3 This study aimed to identify and describe from the 
literature what peers, concepts, and models of peer review are 
associated with open participation in scientific journals.
Design An integrative review was conducted. The search 
strategy was used with Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed. 
The literature was retrieved in March 2021 and was limited to 
the languages English, Portuguese, and Spanish but with no 
time limitations. All data were collected from the final 
sample. Models of open peer review with open participation 
were considered as those that contemplated the participation 
148     Peer Review Congressof the public. These models were characterized according to 
the terminology of open peer review established by Ross-
Hellauer.1 Self-appointed reviewers were regarded as a new 
type of reviewer. The concepts around open peer review 
models with open participation were understood to be the 
foundation for its implementation.
Results A total of 562 studies were retrieved. However, 407 
remained after removing duplicates, and 20 met the inclusion 
criteria. These studies were published in English from 1998 to 
2018. Of these 20 studies, 9 (45%) presented implemented 
models, 7 (35%) discussed public participation and 
comments, 2 (10%) proposed a model, 1 (5%) approached the 
quality of the manuscript selection process, and 1 (5%) 
analyzed the reliability of peer review in open participation. 
Six open peer review models with open participation were 
found. These models were totally open or combined with the 
traditional peer review to discuss manuscripts publicly. These 
models kept the steps of the traditional peer review process or 
were divided into 2 or more stages ( Table 71 ). The peer 
reviewers were the readers of the journal, reviewers invited by 
the editor or author, or patients. The studies that focused on 
public participation and on comments were questioning the 
expertise of this audience to evaluate manuscripts, the incentives to comment, and the potential effect these models 
may have on the careers of researchers. Public comments may 
help to improve the quality of the publication and of the 
manuscript selection process, but they might not increase 
interrater reliability among reviewers. Open access, 
crowdsourcing, interaction, and transparency were the main 
concepts of the models of open peer review with open 
participation.
Conclusions Open peer review models with open 
participation have different degrees of openness, are 
expanding the idea of who a peer reviewer can be, and are 
bringing new challenges to the peer review process. 
Furthermore, open identities are a sensitive aspect of these 
models, for which the concepts are aligned with open science 
values.
