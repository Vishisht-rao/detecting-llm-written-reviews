Write a review for the following abstract.

Abstract: Objective  Academics in non–English speaking countries 
seek to publish in journals that promote locally generated 
knowledge in their language while appreciating having a 
broader reach to English-language audiences. Accordingly, a 
medical journal based in Latin America decided to become 
fully bilingual (Spanish and English). To achieve this 
objective within the constraints of a limited budget, it was 
necessary to modernize the editorial and publishing processes 
and platforms to ensure consistency and accuracy of both 
languages without overstretching existing resources. A strong 
editorial board commitment to bilingualism was required to 
avoid the simpler and less costly decision of publishing only 
in English.
Design A quality improvement intervention was designed to 
overhaul the journal’s peer review, copyediting, and 
publishing technologies to enable simultaneous publication of 
the original Spanish version with the journal-provided 
translation into English at no extra cost to authors, under a 
single digital object identifier. The intervention consisted of 
(1) designing a new peer-review software that applies an 
XML-first approach to the peer-review stage that allows full 
metadata capture at the start, and integrating multilingual 
options for both peer-review and copyediting, thus allowing 
handling of multilingual submissions seamlessly; (2) 
developing an open-source web-content publication platform 
to incorporate automated ingestion of XML, JATS, and PDF 
files and figures; and (3) modernizing the graphic interface 
and the article-level functionalities in the framework of a 
bilingual website. The intervention was partially funded by a 
2-year grant from the Chilean Ministry of Science. The 
journal’s editor in chief and editorial staff were involved in all 
these stages as design partners.
Results Nine months after implementing the first 
component of the intervention, the outcomes were full 
bilingualism, shorter times from acceptance to publication of 
the article, and simultaneous publication of the Spanish and 
English versions ( Table 33 ). The second and third 
components were in the final stages, and full deployment was 
expected by July 2022. Once 100% rollout of the bilingual 
copyediting software was achieved, built-in recycling of 
nontranslatable manuscript sections such as metadata,

keywords, abstracts, and references, would reduce  
inconsistencies between versions and unburden the human 
translators. Because deployment was still partial, the journal 
did offline technical editing of both languages simultaneously, 
thus ensuring the accuracy of both versions. The journal was 
financially sustainable despite the significant effort and 
rollout.
Conclusions Many resources were deployed in this 
intervention. All articles were published in both languages 
with a significantly shorter time to publication of the 2 
languages. It is expected that, with time, artificial 
intelligence–based enhancements will result in greater 
automation and house styling of the Spanish and English 
versions of accepted manuscripts.
