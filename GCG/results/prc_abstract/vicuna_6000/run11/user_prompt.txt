Abstract: Objective To describe how top-ranked journals across 22 
scientific disciplines handle postpublication critique such as 
letters, commentaries, and online comments.1-3
Design Cross-sectional assessment of policies and practices 
related to postpublication critique at 15 journals (top-ranked 
by impact factor) operating in each of 22 scientific disciplines 
(defined by Clarivate Essential Science Indicators) assigned to 
5 high-level scientific domains (defined by the authors; 330 
journals). Policy information was extracted from journal 
websites in November 2019. For each journal offering 
postpublication critique, a random sample of 10 research 
articles published in 2018 (2066 articles) was examined to 
see if they were linked to postpublication critique on the 
article’s webpage (1 journal only published 6 articles in 2018). 
Features of all linked postpublication critiques and associated 
author replies were recorded.
Results Overall,  207 of 330 journals (63%) offered 
postpublication critique such as letters (118), commentaries 
(85), or web comments (41) but often imposed limits on 
length (median, 1000; IQR, 500-1200 words) and time 
to-submit (median, 12; IQR, 4-26 weeks). The most restrictive 
limits were 175 words and 2 weeks; the least restrictive 
policies had no limits. Seventy-four journal policies implied 
independent external peer review of postpublication critique. 
Of a random sample of 2066 research articles published by 
journals offering postpublication critique, 39 (1.9%; 95% CI, 
1.4%-2.6%) were linked to at least 1 postpublication critique (there were 58 postpublication critiques in total). Of these 
target articles, 34 were from the health and life sciences and 5 
were from multidisciplinary journals. Examination of all 58 
postpublication critiques found that they addressed issues 
related to design (19), implementation (3), analysis (19), 
reporting (10), interpretation (45), and ethics (1); 29 were 
paywalled; 45 had conflict of interest statements, 15 of which 
declared a potential conflict; 44 received an author reply, of 
which 41 asserted that the authors’ conclusions were 
unchanged. Fifty-one did not include any novel statistical 
analyses of original or new data, though only 3 target articles 
stated that data were available. The health and life sciences 
and multidisciplinary journals offered and published more 
postpublication critiques relative to other domains 
(Table 23 ). Clinical medicine in particular stood out, with 
the highest prevalence of postpublication critique (13% of 150 
articles) and all 15 journals allowing postpublication critique. 
However, these journals also imposed the strictest limits on 
length (median, 400; IQR, 400-550 words) and time to 
submit (median, 4; IQR, 4-6 weeks).
Conclusions Top-ranked academic journals across scientific 
disciplines often pose barriers to the cultivation, 
documentation, and dissemination of postpublication 
critique. Publication of postpublication critique was rare in 
most disciplines. Published postpublication critique may have 
little effect on authors’ conclusions.
