Abstract: Objective Image reuse is a common problem with the 
integrity of image data reported in scientific articles. 
Considerable resources are expended by the community in 
trying to detect, communicate, and respond to potential 
image reuse. These efforts are manually intensive and often 
take place after publication, when resolution is difficult and 
time-consuming. The study objective was to evaluate the use 
of an artificial intelligence–based tool to identify potential 
image reuse prior to acceptance and address problems then.
Design In this cross-sectional study designed to 
systematically identify and act on instances of image reuse in 
manuscripts submitted to 9 journals published by the 
American Association for Cancer Research, a machine-
assisted process was implemented for detecting potential 
image duplication between images in a manuscript. Prior to 
issuing a provisional acceptance decision, an internal editor 
selected original research manuscripts containing images 
susceptible to duplication and detection and uploaded them 
to a commercial tool (Proofig). The tool’s assessment was 
followed by editor evaluation and refinement of the results 
and communication of potentially problematic image 
duplications to the authors using a standard report generated 
by the tool. Author responses and the outcomes of these queries were recorded in a tracking sheet using a 
standardized classification system.
Results From January 2021 through May 2022, a total of 
207 image duplication queries were sent to authors for their 
response. This represented 9.3% of 2220 original research 
manuscripts that reached this editorial stage and 15% of the 
1367 manuscripts selected for analysis. The distribution of 
duplicate quantity per manuscript was 104 (50%) with 1 
duplicate, 46 (22%) with 2 duplicates, 19 (9%) with 3 
duplicates, 28 (14%) with 4 to 10 duplicates, and 11 (5%) with 
11 or more duplicates. Responses from authors indicated that 
63% (n = 131) of duplications were unintentional, for 
example, from general image mishandling, and 28% (n = 58) 
were intentional duplications for presentation purposes (see 
Table 2  for details). In 2% (n = 5) of cases the author said 
they were investigating or provided no explanation. These 
manuscripts were withdrawn or rejected. In all other cases, 
changes were made to address the duplication(s). Only in 12 
cases did the potential duplication turn out not to be a 
duplication. To compare the time required to identify 
seemingly real duplications for communication to authors, 5 
editors first analyzed 27 manuscripts purely manually and 
then using the tool followed by manual evaluation and 
refinement. The mean time per manuscript for tool-assisted 
analysis was 4.4 minutes (11 duplications identified in 8 
manuscripts) vs 8 minutes (5 duplications identified in 3 
manuscripts) for manual analysis.
Conclusions The use of this artificial intelligence–based 
tool effectively identified real duplications between and Table 2. Author Responses to the Report of Image Duplication

a A single response and outcome was recorded for each author query regardless of the 
number of separate duplications in the manuscript. If there were different explanations for 
different duplications, only the most serious response and outcome were recorded.

acceptance that contained images susceptible to duplication 
and detection. This allowed these problems to be addressed 
prior to publication with minimal manual effort.
