Write a review for the following abstract.

Abstract: Objective  The posting of clinical research reports on 
preprint servers prior to peer review increased dramatically 
during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.1 However, little is known 
about the fate of preprint reports after submission to a 
peer-reviewed journal. This study investigated Annals of 
Internal Medicine ’s experience with submissions available as 
preprints submitted during the first 21 months of the 
pandemic to address the following questions: (1) what was the 
www. peerreviewcongress.org     151acceptance rate of these submissions? and (2) after 
publication, how often did the preprint server note the 
published article?
Design  Data on all submissions from March 1, 2020, through 
January 21, 2022, that appeared on preprint servers were 
collected. Editorial decisions (reject without external review, 
reject after external review or statistical review, and accepted 
for publication) were reported. Finally, for those submissions 
that the journal did not publish but for which it did perform a 
statistical review, a Google Scholar search was performed to 
determine subsequent publication in another indexed journal.
Results  Of all manuscripts submitted between March 1, 
2020, and January 21, 2022, a total of 362 manuscripts were 
posted in a preprint archive prior to submission to Annals of 
Internal Medicine.  Of these, 337 manuscripts (93.6%) were 
rejected, 23 manuscripts (6.3%) were published, and 2 
manuscripts were pending final decision. Additionally, 247 
manuscripts (68.2%) were rejected without external review 
and 115 manuscripts (31.8%) were sent for peer review. Of 
those sent for peer review, 34 manuscripts (29.5%) 
progressed to statistical review. Of those sent for statistical 
review, 11 manuscripts (32.4%) were rejected after statistical 
review. A Google Scholar search showed that 2 manuscripts 
rejected after statistical review were published in other 
journals. Among manuscripts published to preprint servers, a 
link to the peer-reviewed, published version was provided on 
the server for 13 manuscripts (56.5%). Acceptance and 
rejection rates were comparable to submissions that did not 
appear on a preprint server.
Conclusions  There are theoretical advantages to posting 
non–peer-reviewed preprints of clinical research, particularly 
during public health crises, such as a pandemic. However, 
subsequent vetting and publication in peer-reviewed journals 
can help to avoid dissemination of misinformation. 
Unfortunately, a large proportion of submissions posted as 
preprints were not found suitable for publication in a 
clinically influential, peer-reviewed journal. When published, 
the preprint archive did not always acknowledge the 
subsequently published article.
